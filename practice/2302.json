Jon Ronson: You know, I thinkthe very best thing we can do, if you see a kind of unfairor an ambiguous shaming, is to speak up, because I thinkthe worst thing that happened to Justine was that nobody supported her --like, everyone was against her, and that is profoundly traumatizing, to be told by tens of thousands of peoplethat you need to get out. But if a shaming happens and there'sa babble of voices, like in a democracy, where people are discussing it,I think that's much less damaging.", "en": " 這是一場徹底輸了的戰爭嗎？ 朗森：要是你看見了一種不公平或是不甚明確的霸凌， 我認為我們最好就是把話說出來。 因為我認為發生在賈絲汀身上最慘的事情就是沒有人支持她， 就像是每一個人都在抵制她， 那是深深地精神上令人受傷的， 被成千上萬的人要求辭職。 不過要是一件羞辱人的事發生而有著像在民主國家亂烘烘的聲音， 大家都在討論這件事，我想那會不傷人得多。"}, {"zh-tw": " So I think that's the way forward, but it's hard, because if you dostand up for somebody, it's incredibly unpleasant. BG: So let's talk about your experience, because you stood up by writing this book.", "en": " 所以我認為是有再進步的地方， 但是不容易做到，因為要是你支持某人， 這會是極度令人不開心的事。 裘薩尼：那麼讓我們來談你的經驗吧， 因為你透過寫這本書挺身而出，"}, {"zh-tw": " By the way, it's mandatoryreading for everybody, okay? You stood up because the bookactually puts the spotlight on shamers. And I assume you didn't onlyhave friendly reactions on Twitter.", "en": " 順帶一提這對每個人來說都是指定讀物對吧， 你挺身而出因為本書的確把焦點放在霸凌者的身上， 而我猜想在推特上你不是只有友善的回應而已。"}, {"zh-tw": " JR: It didn't go down that wellwith some people. I mean, you don't wantto just concentrate -- because lots of people understood,and were really nice about the book.", "en": " 朗森：我和有些人之間不是很好誘發反應的， 我是指你不想要只專注在 因為很多人都知道了、而且對本書很滿意。"}, {"zh-tw": " But yeah, for 30 years I've been writingstories about abuses of power, and when I say the powerful peopleover there in the military, or in the pharmaceutical industry,everybody applauds me. As soon as I say, \"We are the powerfulpeople abusing our power now,\" I get people saying,\"Well you must be a racist too.\" BG: So the other night --yesterday -- we were at dinner, and there were two discussions going on.", "en": " 不過三十年來我已經不斷寫出有關濫用權力的故事， 而當我說有力人士就就在軍隊裡面、 或是在藥廠行業裡，每一個人都在讚揚我； 當我一說了：「我們就是有力人士，現在正在濫用權力！」， 就有人對我說著：「很好！你必定是一個種族主義者吧！」 裘薩尼：另一晚上我們在用晚餐 － 就是昨天啦， 有兩個持續進行的討論，"}, {"zh-tw": " On one side you were talkingwith people around the table -- and that was a nice,constructive discussion. On the other, every timeyou turned to your phone, there is this deluge of insults.", "en": " 這一邊你和同桌的人在聊天 而且是個愉快、有建設性的討論； 在另一邊每次你回看手機都有著大量的謾罵發言。"}, {"zh-tw": " JR: Yeah. This happened last night.We had like a TED dinner last night. We were chatting and it was lovelyand nice, and I decided to check Twitter.", "en": " 朗森：是啊就發生在昨晚，我們有個像 TED 大會的晚宴， 我們一直在聊天而且友善又愉快的，而我決定去查看一下我的推特，"}, {"zh-tw": " Somebody said, \"You area white supremacist.\" And then I went back and hada nice conversation with somebody, and then I went back to Twitter, somebody said my very existencemade the world a worse place. My friend Adam Curtis says that maybe the Internet is likea John Carpenter movie from the 1980s, when eventually everyonewill start screaming at each other and shooting each other,and then eventually everybody would flee to somewhere safer, and I'm starting to think of thatas a really nice option.", "en": " 某人說：「你是個白人至上主義者！」。 接著我回到聊天裡而且和某人有著很愉快的對話， 接著我回到推特上， 有人說我的存在把世界弄成了一個更糟糕的地方。 我的朋友亞當．科提斯說了 也許網路就像約翰．卡本特來自八零年代的一部電影， 當最終每個人將會開始監視彼此、射殺彼此， 之後最終每個人會逃離到比較安全的某個地方。 我開始在想那確實是個美好的選項！"}, {"zh-tw": " BG: Jon, thank you.JR: Thank you, Bruno.", "en": " 布魯諾：謝謝你！強：謝謝你布魯諾！"}], "title": "Jon Ronson What Happens When Online Shaming Spirals Out Of Control"}
