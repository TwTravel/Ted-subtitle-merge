I had somebody count the number of books with \"happiness\" in the title published in the last five years and they gave up after about 40, and there were many more. There is a huge wave of interest in happiness, among researchers.", "en": " 最近大家都在談論快樂 我請人數了有多少本書 在近五年來出版書名有提到\"快樂\" 他們數到大約超過40本,並且還有更多 越來越多人對快樂的議題感到有興趣 展開研究"}, {"zh-tw": " There is a lot of happiness coaching. Everybody would like to make people happier.", "en": " 其中更多訓練教導人如何變快樂 人人都想讓人更快樂"}, {"zh-tw": " But in spite of all this flood of work, there are several cognitive traps that sort of make it almost impossible to think straight about happiness. And my talk today will be mostly about these cognitive traps.", "en": " 雖這類書籍多如牛毛 仍有些認知上的陷阱 讓人幾乎難以直接領會 快樂的本質 我今天主要談論的就是這些認知陷阱"}, {"zh-tw": " This applies to laypeople thinking about their own happiness, and it applies to scholars thinking about happiness, because it turns out we're just as messed up as anybody else is. The first of these traps is a reluctance to admit complexity.", "en": " 它們既會影響一般人對自身快樂的觀感 也會影響學者對快樂的判斷 因為我們和任何人一樣都會出錯 第一個陷阱 是不願去承認快樂並不簡單"}, {"zh-tw": " It turns out that the word \"happiness\" is just not a useful word anymore, because we apply it to too many different things. I think there is one particular meaning to which we might restrict it, but by and large, this is something that we'll have to give up and we'll have to adopt the more complicated view of what well-being is.", "en": " 事實證明快樂這個詞 已經再也不實用了 因為我們拿它來詮釋太多事情 我想我們應該限定它的意思 不過,一般而言 我們得放棄這個想法 並用更複雜的觀點來看 何謂快樂生活"}, {"zh-tw": " The second trap is a confusion between experience and memory; basically, it's between being happy in your life, and being happy about your life or happy with your life. And those are two very different concepts, and they're both lumped in the notion of happiness.", "en": " 第二個陷阱是經驗和記憶間的混淆 基本上這是在生活中體會快樂 和覺得生活很快樂 樂觀生活之間的差別 這兩者意義相差甚遠 論及快樂常混為一談"}, {"zh-tw": " And the third is the focusing illusion, and it's the unfortunate fact that we can't think about any circumstance that affects well-being without distorting its importance. I mean, this is a real cognitive trap.", "en": " 第三點是大事幻覺論 不幸,當我們想到一些 關於快樂生活的情境 勢必會覺得它特別重要 這是真正的認知陷阱"}, {"zh-tw": " There's just no way of getting it right. Now, I'd like to start with an example of somebody who had a question-and-answer session after one of my lectures reported a story, and that was a story -- He said he'd been listening to a symphony, and it was absolutely glorious music and at the very end of the recording, there was a dreadful screeching sound.", "en": " 避無可避 現在,我想以一個例子開頭 有個人上過我的課後 在Q&A回應了一則故事 這個故事是這樣的 他說他有次在聽交響樂時 覺得音樂真是動聽極了 但在演奏快結束時 卻冒出了可怕刺耳的聲音"}, {"zh-tw": " And then he added, really quite emotionally, it ruined the whole experience. But it hadn't.", "en": " 接著他生氣地表示 這毀了整個愉快的經驗 事實並非如此"}, {"zh-tw": " What it had ruined were the memories of the experience. He had had the experience.", "en": " 毀了的是對於這段經驗的記憶 他經歷了這段經驗"}, {"zh-tw": " He had had 20 minutes of glorious music. They counted for nothing because he was left with a memory; the memory was ruined, and the memory was all that he had gotten to keep.", "en": " 經歷了20分鐘的聽覺饗宴 現在都不算數了 因為他只剩下記憶 有污點的記憶 他就只剩下這段記憶"}, {"zh-tw": " What this is telling us, really, is that we might be thinking of ourselves and of other people in terms of two selves. There is an experiencing self, who lives in the present and knows the present, is capable of re-living the past, but basically it has only the present.", "en": " 這告訴我們 我們在思考自己和別人時 用了兩種我 經驗的我 活在當下 感受當下 也能感受過去的經驗 但基本上他只屬於當下"}, {"zh-tw": " It's the experiencing self that the doctor approaches -- you know, when the doctor asks, \"Does it hurt now when I touch you here?\" And then there is a remembering self, and the remembering self is the one that keeps score, and maintains the story of our life, and it's the one that the doctor approaches in asking the question, \"How have you been feeling lately?\" or \"How was your trip to Albania?\" or something like that. Those are two very different entities, the experiencing self and the remembering self, and getting confused between them is part of the mess about the notion of happiness.", "en": " 當醫生要接觸的是經驗的我 他會問 \"我碰你這裡會痛嗎?\" 另一個是記憶的我 負責記錄生活 抒寫生活故事 醫生要找他時 會這麼問 \"最近感覺如何?\" 或\"去阿爾巴尼亞好玩嗎\",類似的問題 經驗的我和記憶的我 兩者十分不同 我們之所以不懂快樂 兩者的混淆是部分原因"}, {"zh-tw": " Now, the remembering self is a storyteller. And that really starts with a basic response of our memories -- it starts immediately.", "en": " 記憶的我 負責說故事 故事從記憶中直接擷取 即時上傳"}, {"zh-tw": " We don't only tell stories when we set out to tell stories. Our memory tells us stories, that is, what we get to keep from our experiences is a story.", "en": " 我們講故事的時候並不是我們在講 是我們的記憶在說故事 我們從經驗中儲存下來的 是故事"}, {"zh-tw": " And let me begin with one example. This is an old study.", "en": " 讓我用一個例子開頭 以前有個研究"}, {"zh-tw": " Those are actual patients undergoing a painful procedure. I won't go into detail. It's no longer painful these days, but it was painful when this study was run in the 1990s.", "en": " 由真正的病人接受痛苦的治療 細節不多說,現今的療法已不再難受 但在實驗進行的90年代,治療令人痛不欲生"}, {"zh-tw": " They were asked to report on their pain every 60 seconds. Here are two patients, those are their recordings.", "en": " 病人必須每分鐘報告痛苦指數 這邊有兩個病患 還有他們的紀錄"}, {"zh-tw": " And you are asked, \"Who of them suffered more?\" And it's a very easy question. Clearly, Patient B suffered more -- his colonoscopy was longer, and every minute of pain that Patient A had, Patient B had, and more.", "en": " 我問你,\"誰受苦多一點?\" 這問題很簡單 顯然,是病人B 他的結腸鏡檢查時間較長 病人A每分鐘感覺的疼痛 病人B也感覺到了,而且更久"}, {"zh-tw": " But now there is another question: \"How much did these patients think they suffered?\" And here is a surprise. The surprise is that Patient A had a much worse memory of the colonoscopy than Patient B.", "en": " 但現在有另一個問題 \"誰感覺比較痛?\" 這裡有個小意外 意外的是病人A 對於結腸鏡檢查的記憶比病人B 還糟糕"}, {"zh-tw": " The stories of the colonoscopies were different, and because a very critical part of the story is how it ends. And neither of these stories is very inspiring or great -- but one of them is this distinct ...", "en": " 兩段結腸鏡檢查的故事不同 重點在於故事的結尾 兩個故事都不怎麼啟發人心 不過其中之一"}, {"zh-tw": " but one of them is distinctly worse than the other. And the one that is worse is the one where pain was at its peak at the very end; it's a bad story.", "en": " 顯然感受比另一個還差 感覺較糟的這一個 結尾時處於疼痛高峰 這不是個好故事"}, {"zh-tw": " How do we know that? Because we asked these people after their colonoscopy, and much later, too, \"How bad was the whole thing, in total?\" And it was much worse for A than for B, in memory. Now this is a direct conflict between the experiencing self and the remembering self.", "en": " 我們怎知道的? 因為我們在檢查結束後問他們 稍晚之後問說 \"整體而言,感覺多糟?\" 而A的記憶感覺比B糟糕許多 顯然經驗的我和記憶的我之間 有了直接衝突"}, {"zh-tw": " From the point of view of the experiencing self, clearly, B had a worse time. Now, what you could do with Patient A, and we actually ran clinical experiments, and it has been done, and it does work -- you could actually extend the colonoscopy of Patient A by just keeping the tube in without jiggling it too much.", "en": " 就經驗的我來看 顯然B比較難受 那病人A的情況該怎麼解釋 我們實際做了臨床實驗 實驗完成了,確實有用 病人A的檢查結果能得到解釋 在於持續插入導管時不晃動得太厲害"}, {"zh-tw": " That will cause the patient to suffer, but just a little and much less than before. And if you do that for a couple of minutes, you have made the experiencing self of Patient A worse off, and you have the remembering self of Patient A a lot better off, because now you have endowed Patient A with a better story about his experience.", "en": " 雖然病人還是會痛 但只有一點點 比先前好受許多 繼續這樣做,幾分鐘下來 病人A的經驗的我 感覺每況愈下 而病人A記憶的我 感覺好多了 因為你給了病人A 一個好一點的故事 記憶他的經驗"}, {"zh-tw": " What defines a story? And that is true of the stories that memory delivers for us, and it's also true of the stories that we make up. What defines a story are changes, significant moments and endings.", "en": " 故事好壞由什麼決定? 記憶告訴我們的故事 是真實的 我們講的故事也是真的 故事好壞取決於變化 重要時刻和結尾的變化"}, {"zh-tw": " Endings are very, very important and, in this case, the ending dominated. Now, the experiencing self lives its life continuously.", "en": " 結尾非常重要 上面的例子是結尾由主導 經驗的我 延續這個生活經驗"}, {"zh-tw": " It has moments of experience, one after the other. And you can ask: What happens to these moments? And the answer is really straightforward: They are lost forever.", "en": " 擁有各種時刻的經驗,一個接一個 你會問\"這些時刻怎麼了?\" 答案很簡單 他們永遠消失了"}, {"zh-tw": " I mean, most of the moments of our life -- and I calculated, you know, the psychological present is said to be about three seconds long; that means that, you know, in a life there are about 600 million of them; in a month, there are about 600,000 -- most of them don't leave a trace. Most of them are completely ignored by the remembering self.", "en": " 我們生活中大多數時刻 我算了算,以心理學上的現在而言 據說長達三秒 這表示 一個人一生中有大約6億個時刻 一個月有60萬個時刻 它們大多數不留痕跡 大多數被全然忽視了 被記憶的我忽視"}, {"zh-tw": " And yet, somehow you get the sense that they should count, that what happens during these moments of experience is our life. It's the finite resource that we're spending while we're on this earth.", "en": " 但是現在你發現 他們應該也算數 因為我們經驗的每分每秒發生的一切 組成了我們的人生 他們是我們活在地球上 就會消耗的有限資源"}, {"zh-tw": " And how to spend it would seem to be relevant, but that is not the story that the remembering self keeps for us. So we have the remembering self and the experiencing self, and they're really quite distinct.", "en": " 該如何使用 似乎很重要 但這不是故事 也不是記憶的我會留給我們的 我們有記憶的我 和經驗的我 兩者很好區別"}, {"zh-tw": " The biggest difference between them is in the handling of time. From the point of view of the experiencing self, if you have a vacation, and the second week is just as good as the first, then the two-week vacation is twice as good as the one-week vacation.", "en": " 其中最大的不同 在於處理時間的方式 就經驗的我而言 如果你有一個假期 第二週和第一週同等快樂 那麼兩週下來 快樂的份量是一週假期的兩倍"}, {"zh-tw": " That's not the way it works at all for the remembering self. For the remembering self, a two-week vacation is barely better than the one-week vacation because there are no new memories added.", "en": " 記憶的我不是這樣算 對記憶的我來說,兩週假期 沒有比一週假期好多少 因為沒有新的記憶加入"}, {"zh-tw": " You have not changed the story. And in this way, time is actually the critical variable that distinguishes a remembering self from an experiencing self; time has very little impact on the story.", "en": " 你沒有改變故事的劇情 因此 以時間長短 區分記憶的我和經驗的我 是不可靠的 時間對故事影響不大"}, {"zh-tw": " Now, the remembering self does more than remember and tell stories. It is actually the one that makes decisions because, if you have a patient who has had, say, two colonoscopies with two different surgeons and is deciding which of them to choose, then the one that chooses is the one that has the memory that is less bad, and that's the surgeon that will be chosen.", "en": " 記憶的我所做的 不只記憶和說故事 他也是真正做決定的人 因為,假如你的病人有選擇權 先由兩個醫生分別檢查一次 然後選擇醫生 負責選擇的 會選擇感覺較好的記憶中 執行檢查的醫生"}, {"zh-tw": " The experiencing self has no voice in this choice. We actually don't choose between experiences, we choose between memories of experiences.", "en": " 經驗的我 做選擇時無從置喙 我們事實上不是在兩段經驗中做選擇 而是在兩段經驗的記憶中選擇"}, {"zh-tw": " And even when we think about the future, we don't think of our future normally as experiences. We think of our future as anticipated memories.", "en": " 而且,當我們在想未來的時候 一般我們不會以經驗的形式去思考 我們把未來 以預想的記憶形式呈現"}, {"zh-tw": " And basically you can look at this, you know, as a tyranny of the remembering self, and you can think of the remembering self sort of dragging the experiencing self through experiences that the experiencing self doesn't need. I have that sense that when we go on vacations this is very frequently the case; that is, we go on vacations, to a very large extent, in the service of our remembering self.", "en": " 基本上你可以看這個 記憶的我是個暴君 你可以把記憶的我想成 有點像是在跩著經驗的我 透過經驗的我用不著的經驗 主宰個人的思考 我有個想法 當我們放假時 往往 之所以放假 有很大一部分 是為了記憶的我"}, {"zh-tw": " And this is a bit hard to justify I think. I mean, how much do we consume our memories? That is one of the explanations that is given for the dominance of the remembering self.", "en": " 我想這有點難辯證 我們使用了多少記憶 可以解釋 記憶的我 為何能主導"}, {"zh-tw": " And when I think about that, I think about a vacation we had in Antarctica a few years ago, which was clearly the best vacation I've ever had, and I think of it relatively often, relative to how much I think of other vacations. And I probably have consumed my memories of that three-week trip, I would say, for about 25 minutes in the last four years.", "en": " 這讓我想起一次假期 幾年前在南極度過的假期 可說是我最棒的一個假期 和其他假期相比 我比較常想起他 這趟三周的旅程 我大概用掉了 過去四年來大約25分鐘的記憶量"}, {"zh-tw": " Now, if I had ever opened the folder with the 600 pictures in it, I would have spent another hour. Now, that is three weeks, and that is at most an hour and a half.", "en": " 現在,如果我打開資料夾 裡面有600張照片 我可能要多花一小時回憶 三周的旅程 最多用一個半小時回憶"}, {"zh-tw": " There seems to be a discrepancy. Now, I may be a bit extreme, you know, in how little appetite I have for consuming memories, but even if you do more of this, there is a genuine question: Why do we put so much weight on memory relative to the weight that we put on experiences? So I want you to think about a thought experiment.", "en": " 這似乎不成比例 現在,這讓我有點不滿 因為我記得的真是太少了 不過就算你記得再多 這裡有個實際的問題 為什麼我們這麼依賴記憶 比依賴經驗還多 所以我希望你能思考 一個有關思考的實驗"}, {"zh-tw": " Imagine that for your next vacation, you know that at the end of the vacation all your pictures will be destroyed, and you'll get an amnesic drug so that you won't remember anything. Now, would you choose the same vacation? And if you would choose a different vacation, there is a conflict between your two selves, and you need to think about how to adjudicate that conflict, and it's actually not at all obvious, because if you think in terms of time, then you get one answer, and if you think in terms of memories, you might get another answer.", "en": " 想像你的下次假期 你知道假期結束後 你的所有照片會被銷毀 你將吞下一顆遺忘藥 所以你什麼都不會記得 這樣,你還會想過同樣的假期嗎? 如果你選了個不同的假期 你的兩個我之間將產生衝突 你得想辦法裁決這衝突 這不怎麼容易 因為若你考慮到時間 你會選不同的假期 但若你考量到記憶 你可能會選相同的假期"}, {"zh-tw": " Why do we pick the vacations we do is a problem that confronts us with a choice between the two selves. Now, the two selves bring up two notions of happiness.", "en": " 我們為什麼選此而非彼 所要面對的問題 是在兩個我之間作選擇 現在,這兩個我 帶來兩種對快樂的見解"}, {"zh-tw": " There are really two concepts of happiness that we can apply, one per self. So you can ask: How happy is the experiencing self? And then you would ask: How happy are the moments in the experiencing self's life? And they're all -- happiness for moments is a fairly complicated process.", "en": " 這兩套見解 分別對應了兩個我 因此你會問\"經驗的我有多快樂?\" 接著問,經驗的我 每一刻有多快樂? 所有這些快樂的時刻 組成過程相當複雜"}, {"zh-tw": " What are the emotions that can be measured? And, by the way, now we are capable of getting a pretty good idea of the happiness of the experiencing self over time. If you ask for the happiness of the remembering self, it's a completely different thing.", "en": " 情感該如何測量? 順帶一提,我們現在 對於經驗的我隨著時間感受快樂 已經有了概念 而記憶的我所指的快樂 概念完全不同"}, {"zh-tw": " This is not about how happily a person lives. It is about how satisfied or pleased the person is when that person thinks about her life.", "en": " 這不是一個人生活多快樂的問題 而是他對於自己的人生 多滿意,多喜歡"}, {"zh-tw": " Very different notion. Anyone who doesn't distinguish those notions is going to mess up the study of happiness, and I belong to a crowd of students of well-being, who've been messing up the study of happiness for a long time in precisely this way.", "en": " 見解南轅北轍 若不能分辨這兩項見解 就參不透快樂這門學問 我和其他活得好的學生一樣 一直以來參不透快樂 就是這個原因"}, {"zh-tw": " The distinction between the happiness of the experiencing self and the satisfaction of the remembering self has been recognized in recent years, and there are now efforts to measure the two separately. The Gallup Organization has a world poll where more than half a million people have been asked questions about what they think of their life and about their experiences, and there have been other efforts along those lines.", "en": " 近年來 經驗的我的快樂 和記憶的我的滿足 之間的差別已能分清 目前正努力要分別測量兩者的程度 蓋洛普在世界各地做民調 其中超過50萬人 曾被問到一些問題 看他們如何看待自己的生活 以及他們如何看待經驗 這些問題外,也做了不少調查"}, {"zh-tw": " So in recent years, we have begun to learn about the happiness of the two selves. And the main lesson I think that we have learned is they are really different.", "en": " 所以近年來,我們逐漸得知 兩個我個別的快樂 而我們主要學到的便是 兩者真的很不一樣"}, {"zh-tw": " You can know how satisfied somebody is with their life, and that really doesn't teach you much about how happily they're living their life, and vice versa. Just to give you a sense of the correlation, the correlation is about .5.", "en": " 你可以知道一個人對生活是否滿意 但這並不能告訴你 他們平常活得多快樂 反之亦然 只是要讓你對其中的關聯有概念 關聯約有五點"}, {"zh-tw": " What that means is if you met somebody, and you were told, \"Oh his father is six feet tall,\" how much would you know about his height? Well, you would know something about his height, but there's a lot of uncertainty. You have that much uncertainty.", "en": " 意思是當你見到某個人 並被告知他爸爸六呎高 你能知道他有多高嗎? 好吧,你可能有個概念 但非常不確定 你沒法篤定"}, {"zh-tw": " If I tell you that somebody ranked their life eight on a scale of ten, you have a lot of uncertainty about how happy they are with their experiencing self. So the correlation is low.", "en": " 若我說有人10分裡給自己的生活8分 你不能把握 他們經驗的我 有多快樂 所以關聯性很低"}, {"zh-tw": " We know something about what controls satisfaction of the happiness self. We know that money is very important, goals are very important.", "en": " 我們知道什麼能夠 讓人的快樂得到滿足 我們知道錢很重要 目標非常重要"}, {"zh-tw": " We know that happiness is mainly being satisfied with people that we like, spending time with people that we like. There are other pleasures, but this is dominant.", "en": " 我們知道要滿足快樂 主要是由我們喜愛的人 和他們在一起的時間來感受 雖然有其他的原因,但這是最主要的"}, {"zh-tw": " So if you want to maximize the happiness of the two selves, you are going to end up doing very different things. The bottom line of what I've said here is that we really should not think of happiness as a substitute for well-being.", "en": " 所以若你想讓兩個我都超快樂 你必須拋開過去的方式 做一些很不同的事情 我說的是,至少 我們不應該把快樂 當作活得好的代名詞"}, {"zh-tw": " It is a completely different notion. Now, very quickly, another reason we cannot think straight about happiness is that we do not attend to the same things when we think about life, and we actually live.", "en": " 兩個完全不一樣 現在,很快地 另個我們不能理解快樂本質的原因 在於我們所指不同 怎麼看生活,和實際怎麼過生活不一樣"}, {"zh-tw": " So, if you ask the simple question of how happy people are in California, you are not going to get to the correct answer. When you ask that question, you think people must be happier in California if, say, you live in Ohio.", "en": " 所以當你問加州的人有多快樂 你將得不到正確答案 因為當你這麼問時 你認為住加州一定比較快樂 剛好,你住在俄亥俄洲"}, {"zh-tw": " And what happens is when you think about living in California, you are thinking of the contrast between California and other places, and that contrast, say, is in climate. Well, it turns out that climate is not very important to the experiencing self and it's not even very important to the reflective self that decides how happy people are.", "en": " 當你在想 住在加州有多快樂時 你會想到 加州和其他地方的差異 差異,其實是氣候的不同 這也證明氣候條件 對於經驗的我並不很重要 事實上對衡量人有多快樂 也不太重要"}, {"zh-tw": " But now, because the reflective self is in charge, you may end up -- some people may end up moving to California. And it's sort of interesting to trace what is going to happen to people who move to California in the hope of getting happier.", "en": " 不過,既然現在是由思考主導 一些人可能會得到一個結論 就是搬到加州 追蹤為了更快樂而搬去加州的人 觀看他們的後續發展,相當有趣"}, {"zh-tw": " Well, their experiencing self is not going to get happier. We know that.", "en": " 他們的經驗的我 不會變得比較快樂 這我們都知道"}, {"zh-tw": " But one thing will happen: They will think they are happier, because, when they think about it, they'll be reminded of how horrible the weather was in Ohio, and they will feel they made the right decision. It is very difficult to think straight about well-being, and I hope I have given you a sense of how difficult it is.", "en": " 不過一件事發生了,他們覺得自己快樂多了. 因為在他們思考時 他們會想到俄亥俄州的壞天氣 並覺得自己做了正確的決定 要理解快樂生活 實在很難 我希望已經讓你們有點概念 明白這到底有多難"}, {"zh-tw": " Thank you. Chris Anderson: Thank you. I've got a question for you.", "en": " 謝謝 謝謝你的演說,我有問題想請教你"}, {"zh-tw": " Thank you so much. Now, when we were on the phone a few weeks ago, you mentioned to me that there was quite an interesting result came out of that Gallup survey.", "en": " 真的很感謝你 我們幾星期前在電話裡 你提過蓋洛普的調查中 有個有趣的發現"}, {"zh-tw": " Is that something you can share since you do have a few moments left now? Daniel Kahneman: Sure. I think the most interesting result that we found in the Gallup survey is a number, which we absolutely did not expect to find.", "en": " 現在你可以跟我們分享一下嗎 還有幾分鐘 好的 我想蓋洛普調查的發現,最有趣的 是個數字,能發現它實屬意外"}, {"zh-tw": " We found that with respect to the happiness of the experiencing self. When we looked at how feelings, vary with income.", "en": " 我們發現關於經驗我的快樂 有個現象 就是人的感覺 會隨收入而不同"}, {"zh-tw": " And it turns out that, below an income of 60,000 dollars a year, for Americans -- and that's a very large sample of Americans, like 600,000, so it's a large representative sample -- below an income of 600,000 dollars a year... CA: 60,000.", "en": " 結果發現,對美國人而言 年收入低於6萬美元的人 佔了樣本中很大一部份,約60萬 但這些年收入低於60萬美元的樣本 相當具有指標性 是6萬美元"}, {"zh-tw": " DK: 60,000. 60,000 dollars a year, people are unhappy, and they get progressively unhappier the poorer they get.", "en": " 6萬美元 年收入6萬美元的人不快樂 而且越窮的人數據顯示越不快樂"}, {"zh-tw": " Above that, we get an absolutely flat line. I mean I've rarely seen lines so flat.", "en": " 6萬以上,我們得到一條水平線 難得看到這麼平坦的線"}, {"zh-tw": " Clearly, what is happening is money does not buy you experiential happiness, but lack of money certainly buys you misery, and we can measure that misery very, very clearly. In terms of the other self, the remembering self, you get a different story.", "en": " 顯然 金錢買不了經驗的快樂 但沒錢除了悲慘什麼都買不到 而悲慘的程度差別 顯而易見 就另一個我,記憶的我而言 你有了不一樣的故事"}, {"zh-tw": " The more money you earn, the more satisfied you are. That does not hold for emotions.", "en": " 你賺得越多就越滿意 跟情感沒有關係"}, {"zh-tw": " CA: But Danny, the whole American endeavor is about life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness.
