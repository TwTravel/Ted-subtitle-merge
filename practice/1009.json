You can see my fellow riders at the end of the picture, looking at me with some concern.", "en": " 就好像 我與偉大的傳統 或是與自身之外的能量 相連接 待會兒 在最後的照片中 會看到其他 同伴車友 以異樣的眼神看著我"}, {"zh-tw": " And here is another picture of them. Unfortunately, I cannot show their faces, neither can I disclose their true names, and that's because my fellow riders are juvenile inmates, offenders spending time in a correction facility about 20 minutes' ride from here -- well, like everything in Israel.", "en": " 這是一張他們的照片 但我不能揭露他們的長相 以及他們的真實姓名 因為 我的車友們 都是 少年受刑人 行兇者 所以都被囚禁於距離此地20分鐘的 少年看護所中。 在以色列 距離都是不遠的"}, {"zh-tw": " And I've been riding with these kids once a week, every Tuesday, rain or shine, for the last four years and by now, they've become a very big part of my life. This story began four years ago.", "en": " 我每週一次與他們騎行 過去四年來 不論晴雨的每週二 如今, 他們已成為我人生的一重要部份 故事由來是從四年前開始"}, {"zh-tw": " The correction facility where they are locked up happens to be right in the middle of one of my usual trips, and it's surrounded by barbed wires and electric gates and armed guards. So on one of these rides, I talked my way into the compound and went to see the warden.", "en": " 這些少年受刑人被關起來的看護所 就在我常經過的 路途中 那個地方環繞著流刺網 電動門 與武裝守衛 就在一趟單車旅程中 我說服他們讓我進入看護所 我去見了典獄長"}, {"zh-tw": " I told the warden that I wanted to start a mountain biking club in this place and that basically I wanted to take the kids from here to there. And I told him, \"Let's find a way in which I'll be able to take out 10 kids once a week to ride with in the summer in the country.\" And the warden was quite amused, and he told me he thought that I was a nut and he told me, \"This place is a correction facility. These guys are serious offenders.", "en": " 並告訴他 我想在這樣的環境組織個單車社團 基本上, 我就只是想帶這些孩子 去四處逛逛 我這樣說的: \"讓我們想個方式 讓我能每週能帶10個孩子 夏天騎單車看看這個國家\" 他只覺得好笑 他告訴我 他覺得我是瘋子 他繼續說: \"這是監獄, 這些傢伙是暴力罪犯"}, {"zh-tw": " They are supposed to be locked up. They aren't supposed to be out at large.\" And yet, we began to talk about it, and one thing led to another.", "en": " 他們是該被關起來 不是該放任四處遊蕩.\" 總之, 我們開始了對話 並一件一件的克服了所有障礙"}, {"zh-tw": " And I can't see myself going into a state prison in New Jersey and making such a proposition, but this being Israel, the warden somehow made it happen. And so two months later, we found ourselves \"at large\" -- myself, 10 juvenile inmates and a wonderful fellow named Russ, who became a very good friend of mine and my partner in this project.", "en": " 我無法想像自已 在紐澤西的州立監獄內 提出相同的提案 但這是以色列 那典獄長真的讓它開始進行 所以經過兩個月的準備 我們真的四處遊蕩了 -- 我加上 10個少年犯 以及一個日後成為我好友的 Ross 他也是這計畫的夥伴"}, {"zh-tw": " And in the next few weeks, I had the tremendous pleasure of introducing these kids to the world of total freedom, a world consisting of magnificent vistas like these -- everything you see here is obviously in Israel -- as well as close encounters with all sorts of small creatures coming in all sorts of sizes, colors, shapes, forms and so on. In spite of all this splendor, the beginning was extremely frustrating.", "en": " 在剛開始的幾週 我極度愉快地 帶領這10個孩子 感受完全的自由 感受像這些的 充滿神奇的景點 這些都是在以色列境內拍的 包括不期而遇 的各種生物 各式大小 顏色 形狀 與 型式 等等 儘管會有這樣的喜悅 但開頭總是令人挫折的"}, {"zh-tw": " Every small obstacle, every slight uphill, would cause these fellows to stop in their tracks and give up. So we had a lot of this going on.", "en": " 只要是些許的小小困難 微微的上坡路段 都會造成這些車友 停車或甚至要放棄 所以 我們遇到很多這樣的情況"}, {"zh-tw": " I found out that they had a very hard time dealing with frustration and difficulties -- not because they were physically unfit. But that's one reason why they ended up where they were.", "en": " 我發現 他們很不會 處理挫折與困難 並不是因為他們體力無法承受 而就是因為這原因 才造成他們入獄"}, {"zh-tw": " And I became increasingly more and more agitated, because I was there not only to be with them, but also to ride and create a team and I didn't know what to do. Now, let me give you an example.", "en": " 而我 卻是越來越不耐煩 因為我是在那裡 不只是陪伴而已 而是要繼續騎車 以及維持一個小隊 我當時真的很不知所措 讓我給你們一個例子"}, {"zh-tw": " We're going downhill in some rocky terrain, and the front tire of Alex gets caught in one of these crevasses here. So he crashes down, and he gets slightly injured, but this does not prevent him from jumping up and then starting to jump up and down on his bike and curse violently.", "en": " 正當我們沿著岩石路徑下坡 Alex 的前輪 被夾在巨石縫中 所以他翻落 並受了點傷 傷並沒有重的讓他無法跳起身來 在單車上跳上跳下 怒言相向"}, {"zh-tw": " Then he throws his helmet in the air. His backpack goes ballistic in some other direction.", "en": " 他把安全帽扔向空中 背包則又甩向其他方向"}, {"zh-tw": " And then he runs to the nearest tree and starts to break branches and throw rocks and curse like I've never heard. And I'm just standing there, watching this scene with a complete disbelief, not knowing what to do.", "en": " 再憤怒地跑到就近的樹邊 折斷樹枝 丟擲石塊 喊些我從未聽過的咒罵 我站在那裡 驚訝地 看著這個情景 完全的手足無措"}, {"zh-tw": " I'm used to algorithms and data structures and super motivated students, and nothing in my background prepared me to deal with a raging, violent adolescent in the middle of nowhere. And you have to realize that these incidents did not happen in convenient locations.", "en": " 我習慣理性推算 資料結構 以及自動自發的學生 我過去的經歷 並沒有教導我該如何處理 一個極度憤怒與暴力的青少年 而且是在 不知名的野外 請了解 這些情況都不是發生在 一些方便的地點"}, {"zh-tw": " They happened in places like this, in the Judean Desert, 20 kilometers away from the nearest road.

Forget it.", "en": " 卻都是發生在 像 Judean 沙漠之中 距離 最近的公路有20公里之遙 而沒有顯示在這些照片中的 是零散在這些的騎士中 有一些青少年癱坐在岩石上 喊著: \"我才不要再騎下去了"}, {"zh-tw": " I've had it.\" Well, that's a problem because one way or another, you have to get this guy moving because it's getting dark soon and dangerous. It took me several such incidents to figure out what I was supposed to do.", "en": " 我受夠了.\" 所以 這就是難處了 因為不論如何我們都得讓這車隊繼續移行 因為天暗了只會更危險 經過好幾次我才學會處理這種狀況"}, {"zh-tw": " At the beginning, it was a disaster. I tried harsh words and threats and they took me nowhere.", "en": " 開始幾次真是慘不忍睹 我以嚴厲的語言與威脅回應 他們根本不鳥我"}, {"zh-tw": " That's what they had all their lives. And at some point I found out, when a kid like this gets into a fit, the best thing that you can possibly do is stay as close as possible to this kid, which is difficult, because what you really want to do is go away.", "en": " 這種怒罵方式 是他們一貫的生活常態 終於我才發現 當個孩子處於這種情況 最好的方式就是儘量 靠近這個孩子的身旁 這個做比說難 因為通常你只想 離得遠遠的"}, {"zh-tw": " But that's what he had all his life, people walking away from him. So what you have to do is stay close and try to reach in and pet his shoulder or give him a piece of chocolate.", "en": " 而這也是他們一直所遇到的人們反應 沒有人願意親近他們 所以你要儘量接近他們 試著 進入他們的內心 及安撫他們肩膀 或給他們個 巧克力"}, {"zh-tw": " So I would say, \"Alex, I know that it's terribly difficult. Why don't you rest for a few minutes and then we'll go on.\" \"Go away you maniac-psychopath.", "en": " 我就學會這麼處理: \"Alex, 我知道這是非常困難的 我們就休息個幾分鐘 待會兒再繼續前進.\" \"你滾開 你這瘋子"}, {"zh-tw": " Why would you bring us to this goddamn place?\" And I would say, \"Relax, Alex. Here's a piece of chocolate.\" And Alex would go, \"Arrrrggg!\" Because you have to understand that on these rides we are constantly hungry -- and after the rides also.", "en": " 你幹麼帶我們到這鬼地方?\" 我就會說:\"放輕鬆, Alex, 來吃塊巧克力.\" 接著就會看到Alex \"啊姆~~\" 因為各位得了解 進行越野單車時 肚子永遠是飢餓的 結束後 也如此"}, {"zh-tw": " And who is this guy, Alex, to begin with? He's a 17-year-old. When he was eight, someone put him on a boat in Odessa and sent him, shipped him to Israel on his own.", "en": " 那 Alex 是怎樣的人呢? 他 17 歲 當他 8 歲時 被人用船從Odessa(烏克蘭) 送來以色列 孤零零一人"}, {"zh-tw": " And he ended up in south Tel Aviv and did not have the good luck to be picked up by a [unclear] and roamed the streets and became a prominent gang member. And he spent the last 10 years of his life in two places only, the slums and the state prison, where he spent the last two years before he ended up sitting on this rock there.", "en": " 最後抵達特拉維夫南邊 他運氣不好 沒碰上銜接的人 流浪街頭 更變成幫派的重要成員。 他在過去的10年中 只待過兩個地方 -- 貧民窟與州立監獄。 跌坐在岩石上時 他已服刑兩年了。"}, {"zh-tw": " And so this kid was probably abused, abandoned, ignored, betrayed by almost every adult along the way. So, for such a kid, when an adult that he learns to respect stays close to him and doesn't walk away from him in any situation, irrespective of how he behaves, it's a tremendous healing experience.", "en": " 所以這個孩子 八成被他生命中的 大部份的成人 虐待、拋棄、忽視、及背叛。 所以 對於這樣的孩子來說 一個他所敬愛的成人 能在這種情況下 繼續親近他 沒有背離他 也不在乎他剛剛所表現的 這是個很棒的療傷體驗"}, {"zh-tw": " It's an act of unconditional acceptance, something that he never had. I want to say a few words about vision.", "en": " 這種無條件的接受 更是他從未體會過的。 我想對理想做些說明"}, {"zh-tw": " When I started this program four years ago, I had this original plan of creating a team of winning underdogs. I had an image of Lance Armstrong in my mind.", "en": " 當我四年前開始這計畫時 我當初的想法是 要建立一個 不被看好的車隊 在我的想像中 這會是 像Lance Armstrong 般的團隊。"}, {"zh-tw": " And it took me exactly two months of complete frustration to realize that this vision was misplaced, and that there was another vision supremely more important and more readily available. It all of a sudden dawned on me, in this project, that the purpose of these rides should actually be to expose the kids to one thing only: love.", "en": " 但是經過整整兩個月 的極度失望 我才明白這樣 一廂情願的想法是錯的 取而代之的是 另一個 更重要 更可行 的理想。 忽然間，我應有的 目的明朗了 我們應該 要給這些孩子的 只是一樣東西: 愛。"}, {"zh-tw": " Love to the country, to the uphill and the downhill, to all the incredible creatures that surround us -- the animals, the plants, the insects -- love and respect to other fellow members in your team, in your biking team, and most importantly, love and respect to yourself, which is something that they badly miss. Together with the kids, I also went through a remarkable transformation.", "en": " 愛這個國家 愛這個陡坡 也愛這個下坡 也普及到所有身旁的生物 包括 動物 植物 與昆蟲 愛與尊重 車隊中 的其他同伴 而最重要的是 對自己的愛與尊重。 那是他們 從不知道的 和孩子們一般 我自己也經歷了非尋常的轉變"}, {"zh-tw": " Now, I come from a cutthroat world of science and high technology. I used to think that reason and logic and relentless drive were the only ways to make things happen.", "en": " 我來自於一個競爭激烈 的科技世界 我總以為只有理性邏輯 與自強不息 才能達成目標"}, {"zh-tw": " And before I worked with the kids, anything that I did with them, or anything that I did with myself, was supposed to be perfect, ideal, optimal, but after working with them for some time, I discovered the great virtues of empathy and flexibility and being able to start with some vision, and if the vision doesn't work, well nothing happened. All you have to do is play with it, change it a little bit, and come up with something that does help, that does work.", "en": " 與孩子們相處前 我與他們所做的事 或是我自己做的事 我都以為必須是完美的 理想的, 最佳化的 但和他們相處一段時日後 我才發現同理心 以及彈性處世的重要性 並能開始新的理想 如果這值理想不成功，那也沒甚麼大礙 只要繼續 略微調整一些 便能產出有用的方式"}, {"zh-tw": " So right now, I feel more like these are my principles, and if you don't like them, I have others. And one of these principles is focus.", "en": " 如今 這些就是我學到的 處事原則 若你們不贊同 我還有其他的 其中的一個原則 就是專注"}, {"zh-tw": " Before each ride we sit together with the kids, and we give them one word to think about during the ride. You have to focus their attention on something because so many things happen.", "en": " 在每趟騎車前 我們都會與這些孩子們坐下 我們會給他們一個字 好利用騎車的時候想想 你必須引起他們的專注力在一些事情上 因為會有很多事發生"}, {"zh-tw": " So these are words like \"teamwork\" or \"endurance\" or even complicated concepts like \"resource allocation\" or \"perspective,\" a word that they don't understand. You know, perspective is one of these critically important life-coping strategies that mountain biking can really teach you.", "en": " 像這些字: \"teamwork\" (團隊合作) 或是 \"endurance\" (耐力) 或甚至是複雜的概念 像是 \"資源分配\" 或是 \"觀點\", 這些他們不了解的事 在場的都了解, 觀點 是一個相當重要 的人生課題 越野單車能教懂你這些"}, {"zh-tw": " I tell kids when they struggle through some uphill and feel like they cannot take it anymore, it really helps to ignore the immediate obstacles and raise your head and look around and see how the vista around you grows. It literally propels you upwards.", "en": " 我告訴孩子們 當他們在上坡路段上苦苦掙扎 感覺不能再承受時 專注能讓你忘卻眼前的障礙 幫助你抬起頭 四處看看 看看四周的自然風景 專注能成為你的動力"}, {"zh-tw": " That's what perspective is all about. Or you can also look back in time and realize that you've already conquered steeper mountains before.", "en": " 那就是觀點不同 的差異 或是也能回頭想想過去 明白你所已經征服的旅程 以及那些更陡的險路"}, {"zh-tw": " And that's how they develop self-esteem. Now, let me give you an example of how it works.", "en": " 這就是他們發展出自知與自信 讓我舉個實際例子"}, {"zh-tw": " You stand with your bike at the beginning of February. It's very cold, and you're standing in one of these rainy days, and it's drizzling and cold and chilly, and you're standing in, let's say, Yokneam.", "en": " 你站在單車旁 是二月初 非常冷 又是一個雨天 飄著細雨 又冷又濕 你就站在那 就當是\"Yokneam\"吧!"}, {"zh-tw": " And you look up at the sky through a hole in the clouds you see the monastery at the top of the Muhraka -- that's where you're supposed to climb now -- and you say, \"There's no way that I could possibly get there.\" And yet, two hours later you find yourself standing on the roof of this monastery, smeared with mud, blood and sweat. And you look down at Yokneam; everything is so small and tiny.", "en": " 你仰望天空雲層處 看到 Muhraka 山頂上的寺廟 也就是當前的目的地 你會說: 要上那? 我是絕不可能辦到的 但等到兩小時後 自己就站在那寺廟的屋頂上 灰頭土臉 粘著血漬 與汗水 向下望 Yokneam 每樣東西 都變得那樣渺小"}, {"zh-tw": " And you say, \"Hey, Alex. Look at this parking lot where we started. It's that big.", "en": " 你興奮的說: \"喂 Alex 看看那個我們出發的停車場 那麼丁點"}, {"zh-tw": " I can't believe that I did it.\" And that's the point when you start loving yourself. And so we talked about these special words that we teach them.", "en": " 我無法相信我辦到了！ 那一刻 你就會開始自愛。 這些也是我們會 用來教導他們的討論"}, {"zh-tw": " And at the end of each ride, we sit together and share moments in which those special words of the day popped up and made a difference, and these discussions can be extremely inspiring. In one of them, one of the kids once said, \"When we were riding on this ridge overlooking the Dead Sea -- and he's talking about this spot here -- \"I was reminded of the day when I left my village in Ethiopia and went away together with my brother.", "en": " 每次的旅程結束 我們會坐在一起 分享心得 討論當天的議題 如何的激勵了他們 這種討論 會是相當 激勵人心的 其中一個孩子 就曾說起 \"當我們騎在山嶺上 遠眺死海\" --- 他說的就是這裏 --- \"它讓我想起了 我離開衣索比亞村莊的那一天 跟著我的哥哥"}, {"zh-tw": " We walked 120 kilometers until we reached Sudan. This was the first place where we got some water and supplies.\" And he goes on saying, and everyone looks at him like a hero, probably for the first time in his life.", "en": " 我們走了120公里 直到蘇丹 哪時我們才第一次取得一些水和補給\" 他繼續說 而其他人把他當作英雄聽著 這或許是他生平第一次吧"}, {"zh-tw": " And he says -- because I also have volunteers riding with me, adults, who are sitting there listening to him -- and he says, \"And this was just the beginning of our ordeal until we ended up in Israel. And only now,\" he says, \"I'm beginning to understand where I am, and I actually like it.\" Now I remember, when he said it, I felt goosebumps on my body, because he said it overlooking the Moab Mountains here in the background.", "en": " 因為也有些同行志工 都是成人 坐在那兒 聆聽着他 他繼續說 \"這都只是 考驗的開頭 直到我們抵達以色列。 但直到現在\", 他說 \"我才開始明白自己所處的地方 而且我也真的喜歡這地方\" 當他說這些時 我感到毛管直豎 因為他就是在這Moab山頭上說的"}, {"zh-tw": " That's where Joshua descended and crossed the Jordan and led the people of Israel into the land of Canaan 3,000 years ago in this final leg of the journey from Africa. And so, perspective and context and history play key roles in the way I plan my rides with the kids.", "en": " 約書亞 (Joshua) 就是在這裏降臨 越過約旦 並帶領著以色列人民 到達迦南 (Canaan)。 那是三千年前 在從非洲遷徙 的最後路段。 所以 觀點 意涵 與 歷史 是我計畫 與孩子騎乘路線 的重要依據。"}, {"zh-tw": " We visit Kibbutzim that were established by Holocaust survivors. We explore ruins of Palestinian villages, and we discuss how they became ruins.", "en": " 我們到過由猶太屠殺倖存者所建 的基布茲 (Kibbutzim) 我們到過 巴勒斯坦村莊的殘垣 並討論它們的歷史"}, {"zh-tw": " And we go through numerous remnants of Jewish settlements, Nabatic settlements, Canaanite settlements -- three-, four, five-thousand years old. And through this tapestry, which is the history of this country, the kids acquire what is probably the most important value in education, and that is the understanding that life is complex, and there's no black and white.", "en": " 我們也到過 猶太住居, Nabatic住居 迦南 (Canaanite)住居 等等的遺址。 它們都有3,4,5千年之久。 經由這充塞著 這個國家歷史的掛毯 孩子們學習到 教育中最重要的 價值 也就是明白人生是複雜的 不是單純的黑白分明"}, {"zh-tw": " And by appreciating complexity, they become more tolerant, and tolerance leads to hope. I ride with these kids once a week, every Tuesday.", "en": " 了解與擁抱複雜性 讓他們變得更有容忍度 而容忍能帶來希望 我每週與這些孩子騎一趟 每週二"}, {"zh-tw": " Here's a picture I took last Tuesday -- less than a week ago -- and I ride with them tomorrow also. In every one of these rides I always end up standing in one of these incredible locations, taking in this incredible landscape around me, and I feel blessed and fortunate that I'm alive, and that I sense every fiber in my aching body.", "en": " 這是一張 上週二的照片 還不到一周 明天 又要和他們一起騎 每一次的旅程 我最後總是會站在一無法想像的位置 享受四週美妙的風景 我感覺受到庇祐與幸運 因為我活著 我能感受到在我疲累的 身體內的每一種觸覺"}, {"zh-tw": " And I feel blessed and fortunate that 15 years ago I had the courage to resign my tenured position at NYU and return to my home country where I can do these incredible rides with this group of troubled kids coming from Ethiopia and Morocco and Russia.
