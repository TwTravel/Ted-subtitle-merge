If you think about the sorts of things we've sent Australian militarypersonnel to in recent years, we've got obvious thingslike Iraq and Afghanistan, but you've also got things likeEast Timor and the Solomon Islands, and so on."}, {"zh-tw": "很多諸如此類的軍事任務--很多諸如此類的軍事任務--並不是我們所熟悉的傳統戰爭。事實上，很多這些我們讓士兵做的事情事實上，很多這些我們讓士兵做的事情在像澳大利亞和美國這樣的國家都是由警察包辦的。", "en": "And a lot of these deployments that we're sendingmilitary personnel to these days aren't traditional wars. In fact, a lot of the jobswe're asking military personnel to do in those situations are ones that, in their own countries --Australia, the US and so on -- would actually be done by police officers."}, {"zh-tw": "所以，當士兵從事此類任務時 --會遇到很多問題。因為他們對這樣的任務並沒有受過良好的訓練，另外，真正從事此類任務的 --警務人員接受的是完全不同的培訓，警務人員接受的是完全不同的培訓，就連他們的裝備也截然不同。", "en": "So there's a bunchof problems that come up for military personnelin these situations, because they're doing thingsthey haven't really been trained for. And they're doing things that thosewho do them in their own countries are trained very differently forand equipped very differently for."}, {"zh-tw": "當然這裡有很多原因為什麼 --我們會派遣士兵 --而不是警察去做這些事情。假如澳大利亞要在一夜之間調動一千個人 --去西巴布亚。我們沒有一千名警務人員在那明天就可以馬上走人。但我們的確有一千名士兵隨時都能走。", "en": "Now, there's a bunch of reasonswhy we send military personnel, rather than police, to do these jobs. If Australia had to send1,000 people tomorrow to West Papua, for example, we don't have 1,000 police officershanging around that could go tomorrow, and we do have1,000 soldiers that could go."}, {"zh-tw": "所以，當我們要調動人時，我們會派這些士兵去，因為他們就在那隨時準備待命。在某種意義上 --這些士兵的確也能勝任此類任務他們習慣了在沒有後勤的情況下，去這去哪，做這做那的。他們習慣了在沒有後勤的情況下，去這去哪，做這做那的。", "en": "So when we have to send someone,we send the military -- they're there, they're available, and heck, they're used to going offand doing these things and living by themselves and not having all this extra support. So they are able to do it in that sense."}, {"zh-tw": "但是問題就在於他們所受的訓練與警務人員的不同，當然他們的裝備也不一樣。所以，士兵在處理這類事務時會遇到很多麻煩。所以，士兵在處理這類事務時會遇到很多麻煩。一個特別讓我感興趣的問題是，一個特別讓我感興趣的問題是，當我們派遣這些士兵去做這些任務時，我們應不應該讓他們攜帶不同的裝備我們應不應該讓他們攜帶不同的裝備確切的說，我們應不應該讓士兵們配備警務人員所使用的非殺傷性武器。", "en": "But they aren't trainedthe same way police officers are, and they're certainly not equippedthe way police officers are, so this has raiseda bunch of problems for them when dealing with these issues. One particular thing that's come upthat I am especially interested in, is the question of whether, when we're sending military personnelto do these sorts of jobs, we ought to be equipping them differently; and in particular, whether we oughtto be giving them access to some of the nonlethal weaponsthat police have."}, {"zh-tw": "既然這些士兵們也在做和警察他們做的一樣的事情，他們也應該裝備的一樣。當然，你會想在很多地方，這些非殺傷性武器還是挺管用的。", "en": "Since they're doing some of the same jobs, maybe they should havesome of those things. And there's a range of places you'd thinkthose things would be really useful."}, {"zh-tw": "比如說，軍事關卡。如果有人靠近這些關卡，並且，士兵們不知道此人是不是會具有危險性。他們會想\"這是不是人肉炸彈？”“他們是不是藏了一些東西在他們的衣服裡面?到底會發生什麽?”你不知道這人是不是心懷鬼胎如果這人不聽從士兵們的指示", "en": "For example, when you've gotmilitary checkpoints. If people are approachingthese checkpoints and the military personnel are unsureif this person's hostile or not, say this person approachinghere, and they say, \"Is this a suicide bomber or not? Is something hidden under their clothes? What's going to happen?\" They don't know if the personis hostile or not."}, {"zh-tw": "士兵很可能就會開槍射擊等事情過後，他們才能知道“好啊！我們殺對人了。”“不！我們殺了無辜的老百姓。““不！我們殺了無辜的老百姓。“但是，如果士兵們有非殺傷性武器他們會想，”在這些情況下，我們可以用這個。”", "en": "If the person doesn't follow directions,they may end up shooting them, and then find out afterwardseither, yes, we shot the right person, or, no, this was just an innocent person who didn't understand what was going on. So if they had nonlethal weapons,then they would say, \"We can use themin that sort of situation."}, {"zh-tw": "”至少，當我們搞錯人的時候，我們不會殺了他們。“還有一個例子。這張照片是拍自1990年末，巴爾幹半島的一次任務。這次任務和上一個有所不同。這次，士兵們知道誰是敵人有人很明顯的對士兵們表現出敵意，如開槍，扔石頭什麼的。", "en": "If we shoot someone who wasn't hostile, at least we haven't killed them.\" Another situation: this photois from one of the missions in the Balkans in the late 1990s. This situation is a little bit different, where maybe they know someone is hostile; they've got someone shooting at them or doing something elsethat's clearly hostile, throwing rocks, whatever."}, {"zh-tw": "但是，如果士兵在這個時候回擊的話，很可能會連類一大群無辜的老百姓。軍事人員一般都不喜歡談論像這樣的附帶損害", "en": "But if they respond, there's a range of other people aroundwho are innocent people, who might also get hurt. It'd be collateral damage that the militaryoften doesn't want to talk about."}, {"zh-tw": "所以，他們會想，“如果有非殺傷性武器的話，然後我們知道誰是敵意的，至少我們不會束手無策，就算是傷及了無辜至少我們不會殺死這些老百姓。還有一個建議是，現在越來越多的機器人被使用在不同的任務中我們也能預想到在不久的將來，完全自動化的機器人會被派遣到戰場上。他們會在沒有人類控制的情況下，自我決定要向誰射擊。", "en": "So again, they'd say, \"With accessto nonlethal weapons, if we've got someone we know is hostile, we can do something to deal with them, and know that if we hit anyone else, at least we're not going to kill them.\" Another suggestion has been, since we're putting so manyrobots in the field, we can see the time coming where they're actually goingto send robots out in the field that are autonomous. They'll make their own decisionsabout who to shoot and who not to shoot, without a human in the loop."}, {"zh-tw": "所以，一個建議是，如果我們真的要派遣機器人去執行這些任務，給機器人裝備非殺傷性武器可能是更明智之舉，給機器人裝備非殺傷性武器可能是更明智之舉這樣的話，就算機器人做錯了決定，射錯了人至少他們不會殺了他們。現在有不同種類，各種各樣的非殺傷性武器，其中一些現在已經在使用了，還有一些正在研製當中。", "en": "So the suggestion is, if we're going to send robots outand allow them to do this, maybe it would be a good ideaif they were armed with nonlethal weapons, so if the robot makes a bad decisionand shoots the wrong person, again, they haven't actually killed them. Now, there's a whole rangeof different sorts of nonlethal weapons, some of which are available now, some of which they're developing."}, {"zh-tw": "所以，我們有傳統的非殺傷武器如胡椒喷雾剂O.C.噴霧在這上面或者泰瑟枪（電擊槍）在這。在右上角是一把刺眼的鐳射槍。這種鐳射槍可以讓敵人暫時失明，從而使他們失去方向感。", "en": "You've got traditional thingslike pepper spray, OC spray up at the top there, or Tasers over here. The one on the top right hereis actually a dazzling laser, intended to just blindthe person momentarily and disorient them."}, {"zh-tw": "我們還有裝有橡膠子彈的非殺傷性霰弹猎枪，我們還有裝有橡膠子彈的非殺傷性霰弹獵槍，用來取代傳統的金屬制的子彈。還有，在這個圖像中間的這輛大卡車其實是美軍現在正在使用的，主动压制系统。其實是美軍現在正在使用的，主动压制系统。", "en": "You've got nonlethal shotgun rounds that contain rubber pelletsinstead of the traditional metal ones. And this one in the middlehere, the large truck, is called the Active Denial System, something the US militaryis working on at the moment."}, {"zh-tw": "它在本質上其實是一個大的微波傳導器。它就是所謂的熱射線。", "en": "It's essentially a bigmicrowave transmitter. It's sort of your classicidea of a heat ray."}, {"zh-tw": "比起其它的東西（輻射）熱射線能夠延伸到更遠的距離。被（熱射線）擊中的人會感到瞬間的灼熱感，使得他（她）都想躲開。", "en": "It goes out to a really long distance, compared to any of theseother sorts of things. Anybody who is hit with thisfeels a sudden burst of heat, and just wants to get out of the way."}, {"zh-tw": "當然，它比一個微波爐要來的複雜，但是，它其實就是在煮你皮膚表面的水分子。但是，它其實就是在煮你皮膚表面的水分子。所以，你會感到極度的熱量然後你會想，“我想離開這裡！”所以，他們（軍事人員）想，這東西可能在像驅趕人群的這樣的場合中會很管用。如果人群懷有敵意，", "en": "It is a lot more sophisticatedthan a microwave oven, but it basically is boilingthe water molecules in the very surface level of your skin. So you feel this massive heat, and you go, \"I wantto get out of the way.\" And they think this will be really useful in places where we need to cleara crowd out of a particular area, if the crowd is being hostile."}, {"zh-tw": "然後，我們想讓這群人遠離某些地方我們就可以使用像這樣的東西（主动压制系统）。所以，有很多不同種類的非殺傷性武器我們可以提供給軍事人員。另外，在很多種不同的形勢下，他們會認為非殺傷性武器會很管用。但是，我認為士兵和警察是截然不同的。（笑）", "en": "If we need to keep peopleaway from a particular place, we can do that with these sorts of things. So there's a whole rangeof different nonlethal weapons we could give military personnel, and there's a whole range of situations where they're looking at them and saying, \"These things would be really useful.\" But as I said, the military and the policeare very different."}, {"zh-tw": "當然，就算你不那麼仔細的觀察你也會發現他們可能有所不同。更確切的說，他們對使用武力的態度和他們對使用武力所接受的訓練是非常不一樣的。", "en": "Yes, you don't have to lookvery hard at this to recognize that they might be very different. In particular, the attitude to the use of force and the way they're trained to use force is especially different."}, {"zh-tw": "警察們 --我了解他們，因為我曾經訓練過他們 --警察，尤其是在西方體制下的警察所接受的訓練是如何緩解衝突，他們試圖盡量避免使用武力，他們試圖盡量避免使用武力，只有在逼不得已的情況下他們才會使用致命武器。士兵是為了戰爭而訓練的，", "en": "The police -- and knowing because I've actuallyhelped to train police -- police, particularlyin Western jurisdictions at least, are trained to De-escalate force, to try and avoid using forcewherever possible, and to use lethal forceonly as an absolute last resort. Military personnelare being trained for war."}, {"zh-tw": "，所以一旦形勢惡化了，他們的第一反應就是使用致命武器。在大難臨頭之際士兵們就可以開始掃射群眾。", "en": "So they're trained that,as soon as things go bad, their first response is lethal force. The moment the fecal matterhits the rotating turbine -- you can start shooting at people."}, {"zh-tw": "所以他們對使用武力的態度是十分不同的，所以他們對使用武力的態度是十分不同的。想當然地，他們對使用非殺傷性武器的態度也會和警察的不同。我認為觀察這類事情並試圖將它與戰爭聯繫起來會是個不錯的主意。因為就連警察在使用非殺傷性武器時也遇到了種種問題。", "en": "So their attitudes to the use of lethal forceare very different, and I think it's fairly obvious that their attitude to the useof nonlethal weapons would also be very differentfrom what it is with the police. And since we've already hadso many problems with police use of nonlethalweapons in various ways, I thought it would be a good ideato look at some of those things and relate it to the military context."}, {"zh-tw": "我當時覺得很奇怪，當我開始做這件事的時候我驚奇的發現就連那些支持推廣非殺傷性武器的軍事人員也都還沒開始做這件事。他們通常認為，“我們為什麼要去關注在警察身上發生了什麽？警察和士兵可不同。\"但是他們好像並沒有發現，事實上他們（警察和士兵）所遇到的是一類問題。", "en": "I was very surprised when I startedto do this to see that, in fact, even the people who advocated the useof nonlethal weapons by the military hadn't actually done that. They generally seemed to think, \"Why would we carewhat's happened with the police? We're looking at something different,\" and didn't seem to recognize they were looking at prettymuch the same stuff."}, {"zh-tw": "所以，我就開始研究並調查這類事情。所以，我就開始研究並調查這類事情。非殺傷性武器剛被採用時，警察是如何使用它的。並且，他們在使用過程中遇到了那些問題。並且，他們在使用過程中遇到了那些問題。並且，他們在使用過程中遇到了那些問題。，理所當然的，作為一位澳大利亞人我對在不同時間（澳）引進非殺傷性武器的事情比較楚，我對在不同時間（澳）引進非殺傷性武器的事情比較楚，所以我首先調查了澳大利亞", "en": "So I started to investigatesome of those issues, and have a look at the waypolice use nonlethal weapons when they're introduced, and some of the problems that mightarise out of those sorts of things when they actually do introduce them. And of course, being Australian, I started looking at stuff in Australia,knowing from my own experience of various times when nonlethal weaponshave been introduced in Australia."}, {"zh-tw": "我當時特別關注的事情之一就是O.C.噴霧器是如何被警察所使用，O.C.噴霧器是如何被警察所使用，諸如，辣椒红色素喷雾、胡椒喷雾,、。另外還有，當O.C 噴霧器被採用時所發生的事情，和諸如此類的事宜。我覺得有這麼 一個在昆士蘭的研究我覺得有這麼 一個在昆士蘭的研究特別有意思。因為他們在全面推廣胡椒喷雾前有一段適用期。", "en": "One of the things I particularlylooked at was the use of OC spray -- oleoresin capsicum spray, pepper spray -- by Australian police, and seeing what had happenedwhen that had been introduced, and those sorts of issues. And one study that I found,a particularly interesting one, was in Queensland, because they had a trial periodfor the use of pepper spray before they actuallyintroduced it more broadly."}, {"zh-tw": "然我就看了看數據。當初他們在昆士蘭引進 O.C 噴霧時目標很明確.", "en": "And I went and had a lookat some of the figures here. Now, when they introducedOC spray in Queensland, they were really explicit."}, {"zh-tw": "他們並且在這方面做了很多的公共聲明.他們說,\"這是一個很明確的指示我們想要給警務人在警告和開槍之間多增加一種選擇.", "en": "The police minister's and a heapof public statements were made about it. They were saying, \"This is explicitlyintended to give police an option between shouting and shooting."}, {"zh-tw": "在這些之前需要開槍的情況中,警察可以使用O.C噴霧,而不是槍.雖然， 像這種警察開槍數據在澳大利亞各個州很難找到我還是找到並調查了這些統計數據。我只找到了這些數據。", "en": "This is something they can useinstead of a firearm in situations where they would havepreviously had to shoot someone.\" So I looked at allof the police shooting figures. And you can't actuallyfind them very easily for individual Australian states; I could only find these."}, {"zh-tw": "這是來自於，澳大利亚犯罪学学院的报告就如你們在這上面所看到的“警察開槍所導致的死亡” 不只包括被警察開搶射死的人還包括了那些在警察面前開搶射殺自己的人。", "en": "This is from an Australian Instituteof Criminology report. You can see, in the fine print at the top: \"Police shooting deaths\"means not just people shot by police, but people who have shot themselvesin the presence of police."}, {"zh-tw": "這是全國性的數據正如崑山頓，這個紅色箭頭表示的正如崑山頓，這個紅色箭頭表示的，“這裡就是那些在全國需要給警務人員配備O.C噴霧的地區”“這裡就是那些在全國需要給警務人員配備O.C噴霧的地區”所以在這裡你可以看見六個死亡組合，從低到高，數據包括了數年。在前幾年，這裡有一個忽漲，但是這裡不是昆士兰州。", "en": "But these are the figuresacross the entire country, and the red arrow representsthe point where Queensland said, \"Yes, this is where we're going to give all police officersacross the entire state access to OC spray.\" So you can see there were six deathssort of leading up to it, every year for a number of years. There was a spike a few years before, but that wasn't actually Queensland."}, {"zh-tw": "誰知道這是哪裡？ 不， 不是 阿瑟港維多利亞？ 對了。", "en": "Anyone know where that was? Wasn't Port Arthur, no. Victoria? Yes, correct."}, {"zh-tw": "這裡的猛增多來源於維多利亞。所以，不是只有昆士兰州有這些問題，問題像警察射殺所導致的死亡之類的。", "en": "That spike was all Victoria. So it wasn't that Queenslandhad a particular problem with deaths from policeshootings and so on."}, {"zh-tw": "在全國有六個射殺事件。在前幾年，這個數字相當的穩定所以，當他們引進了O.C 噴霧以後的那兩年裡 ， 2001 和 2002 年裡。", "en": "So, six shootingsacross the whole country, fairly consistently over the years before. The next two years were the yearsthey studied -- 2001, 2002."}, {"zh-tw": "所以，當他們引進了O.C 噴霧以後的那兩年裡 ， 2001 和 2002 年裡。他們研究了在昆士兰州，警察使用噴霧器的數量。有沒有人想要猜一猜這個數字？一百？ 一， 三。一千更接近了。這是一個很明確的意圖，除了使用致命武器外另外一個選擇 --在警告和開槍之間,多增加一種選擇.", "en": "Anyone want to take a stabat the number of times, given how they've introduced this, the number of times police in Queenslandused OC spray in that period? Hundreds? One? Three? A thousand is getting better. Explicitly introduced as an alternativeto the use of lethal force -- an alternative betweenshouting and shooting."}, {"zh-tw": "我現在想說得再明白點（爬高枝）如果昆士兰州的警察沒有使用噴霧劑的話，他們不可能在這兩年裡，射殺了2226 個人。他們不可能在這兩年裡，射殺了2226 個人。事實上，如果你看一看他們調查結果。他們所收集的資料和審查，他們調查結果。他們所收集的資料和審查，你會發現在警察使用噴霧器的事件中，只有百分之15是的嫌疑犯攜帶了武器。", "en": "I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that if Queensland policedidn't have OC spray, they wouldn't have shot 2,226 people in those two years. In fact, if you have a lookat the studies they were looking at, the material they werecollecting and examining, you can see the suspects were only armedin about 15 percent of cases where OC spray was used."}, {"zh-tw": "在那個時期，O.C噴霧器是被常規的使用的，當然，現在也是 --這是應為，沒有對這類事件有任何的投訴至少在這個調查中沒有 --噴霧器在面對這類人被常規的使用，比如說暴力的人，或者具有暴力傾向的人另外，噴霧器也會被拿來對付那些只是不喜歡順從警察命令的那些人。這些人沒有做任何具有暴力傾向的事，但是，他們只是不想去做別人讓他們做的事，", "en": "It was routinely beingused in this period, and, of course, still is routinely used -- because there were no complaints about it, not within the contextof this study, anyway -- it was routinely being usedto deal with people who were violent, who were potentially violent, and also quite frequently used to deal with people who weresimply passively noncompliant. This person is not doing anything violent, but they just won't dowhat we want them to."}, {"zh-tw": "他們沒有服從警察的命令，所以警察就對他們使用了O.C噴霧器。這樣可以迅速解決問題。", "en": "They're not obeyingthe directions we're giving them, so we'll give them a shotof the OC spray -- that'll speed them up. Everything will work out better that way."}, {"zh-tw": "這就是他們所說的，“在使用手槍以外，有另外一個選擇，但是，O.C 噴霧器在很多的領域中和其他的問題中但是，O.C 噴霧器在很多的領域中和其他的問題中被過度使用了。現在，我們來說說，軍事人員在使用非殺傷性武器所遇到的問題現在，我們來說說，軍事人員在使用非殺傷性武器所遇到的問題人們說， “可能會有一些問題”其中有些問題被特別關注了。", "en": "This was something explicitly introduced to be an alternative to firearms, but it's being routinely used to deal with a whole rangeof other sorts of problems. Now one of the particularissues that comes up with military use of nonlethal weapons -- and people actually say,\"There might be some problems\" -- there's a couple of particularproblems that get focused on."}, {"zh-tw": "其中一個問題就是非殺傷性武器被不加以區分地使用了。軍事人員在使用武力時所要依循的原則之一就是要懂得辨別。當你要開槍時要非常小心", "en": "One of those problems is: nonlethalweapons may be used indiscriminately. One of the fundamental principlesof military use of force is that you have to be discriminate; you have to be carefulabout who you're shooting at."}, {"zh-tw": "所以， 由於， 你不需要太擔心使用非殺傷性武器其中一個使用非殺傷性武器的問題就是它們被隨意地使用在一批人身上。就是它們被隨意地使用在一批人身上。事實上，我覺得有一個例子，一個已經發生了的例子可以說明問題。那就是在2002年，俄羅斯大劇院人質事件。不像我的一些年輕的學生們，大部分在座的老一輩應該還能記得。", "en": "So one of the problems suggestedwith nonlethal weapons is that they might be usedindiscriminately -- that you would use themagainst a whole range of people, because you don't haveto worry so much anymore. And in fact, one particular instancewhere I think that actually happens was the Dubrovka Theatersiege in Moscow in 2002, which probably a lot of you,unlike most of my students at ADFA, are old enough to remember."}, {"zh-tw": "一些車臣份子闖進了劇院，並且控制了全場。他們挾持了將近700多名人質。", "en": "So, Chechens had come inand taken control of the theater. They were holding somethinglike 700 people hostage."}, {"zh-tw": "雖然他們釋放了其中一些人，但是他們還是有將近700名人質。然後，俄羅斯特總部隊，雪域特戰隊，偷襲並橫掃了劇院。", "en": "They'd released a bunch of people, but they still hadabout 700 people hostage. And the Russian military policespecial forces, \"Spetsnaz,\" came in and stormed the theater."}, {"zh-tw": "他們先是將整個劇院灌入麻醉氣體。結果發現很多人質由於吸入了這些氣體而死亡。", "en": "The way they did it was to pumpthe whole thing full of anesthetic gas. And it turned outthat lots of the hostages died as a result of inhaling the gas."}, {"zh-tw": "這就是一個任意濫用武器的例子。不難想像，有人會因為這而喪身。", "en": "It was used indiscriminately. They pumped the whole theaterfull of the gas."}, {"zh-tw": "他們把這個劇院灌滿了麻醉氣體。你不知道每個人會吸入多少氣體，你不知道每個人會吸入多少氣體，當他們失去意識時，會以什麼姿勢倒地，等等。當他們失去意識時，會以什麼姿勢倒地，等等。事實上，整個事件只有兩個人被開槍射擊事實上，整個事件只有兩個人被開槍射擊", "en": "And it's no surprise that people died, because you don't know how much gaseach person is going to inhale, what position they'll fall in whenthey become unconscious, and so on. There were, in fact,only a couple of people who got shot in this episode."}, {"zh-tw": "所以，當他們回顧發現，只有兩個人是明顯地被挾持者或特總部隊開槍射擊而亡。只有兩個人是明顯地被挾持者或特總部隊開槍射擊而亡。只有兩個人是明顯地被挾持者或特總部隊開槍射擊而亡。只有兩個人是明顯地被挾持者或特總部隊開槍射擊而亡。幾乎所有喪生的人都是由於吸入了這種麻醉氣體。", "en": "So when they had a look at it afterward, there were only a couple of peoplewho'd apparently been shot, by the hostage takersor by the police forces trying to deal with the situation. Virtually everybody that got killed got killed from inhaling the gas."}, {"zh-tw": "最後喪生的人質總數還是有點不清楚但肯定是比當場死亡人數要多，因為有些人在過後幾天身亡。這就是其中一個我們所說的濫用非致命性武器的問題。", "en": "The final toll of hostagesis a little unclear, but it's certainly a few more than that, because other people diedover the next few days. So this was one problem they talked about, that it might be used indiscriminately."}, {"zh-tw": "第二個人們時常談到的在使用非殺傷性武器時的問題，第二個人們時常談到的在使用非殺傷性武器時的問題，這也是化學武器公約裡所談到的，很明顯的，不應把軍用化學武器用於戰爭這個問題就在於這些非殺傷性武器不是用於替代殺傷性武器的而是用來輔助殺傷性武器的 --你可以先使用非殺傷性武器然後你再使用殺傷性武器時就會變得更有效。被你射擊的人將無法躲開。被你射擊的人將無法躲開。", "en": "A second problempeople sometimes talk about with military use of nonlethal weapons -- and it's actually why,in the chemical weapons convention, it's very clear that you can't useriot-control agents as weapons of warfare -- is that it's seen that sometimesnonlethal weapons might be used not as an alternative to lethal force, but as a lethal force multiplier: that you use nonlethal weapons first, so your lethal weaponswill actually be more effective. The people you'll be shooting atwon't be able to get out of the way."}, {"zh-tw": "你可以更輕鬆的殺死他們，因為他們不知道發生了什麼。然而事實上，那正是所發生的事", "en": "They won't be aware of what's happening,and you can kill them better. And that's exactly what happened here."}, {"zh-tw": "那些由於吸入氣體而昏迷的挾持人質者沒有被逮捕，而是被直接爆了頭。所以，在這場事件中，非殺傷性武器被用來輔助殺傷性武器，從而可以更有效率的殺戮。從而可以更有效率的殺戮。", "en": "The hostage takers who hadbeen rendered unconscious by the gas were not taken into custody; they were simply shot in the head. So this nonlethal weaponwas being used in this case as a lethal force multiplier, to make killing more effectivein this particular situation."}, {"zh-tw": "我還想簡單的提一下另一個問題，那就是，人所接受的非殺傷性武器的培訓方法那就是，人所接受的非殺傷性武器的培訓方法那就是，人所接受的非殺傷性武器的培訓方法有堆積如山的問題。因為他們是在一個良好及安全的環境下接受訓練同樣，他們也是在這樣的環境下接受考核。就像這裡，你可以確切地看到發生了什麼。", "en": "Another problem I want to quickly mention is that there's a whole heap of problems with the way people are actuallytaught to use nonlethal weapons, and get trained about themand then tested and so on. Because they're testedin nice, safe environments, and are taught to use themin nice, safe environments -- like this, where you can seeexactly what's going on."}, {"zh-tw": "這裡在使用O.C噴霧器的人戴着塑膠手套以確保他們不會被污染但是在現實中，這些殺傷性武器", "en": "The person spraying the OC sprayis wearing a rubber glove to make sure they don't getcontaminated, and so on. But they're never used like that."}, {"zh-tw": "不是被這樣使用的，就像在德克萨斯州，“警察對老奶奶使用電擊槍”我承認， 這一事件激起了我的興趣。這件事情發生的時候，我是美國海軍學院的一名研究員", "en": "They're used out in the real world, like in Texas, like this: [\"Police Taser Great-GrandmotherDuring Traffic Stop\"] I confess, this particular casewas one that piqued my interest in this. It happened while I was workingas a research fellow at the US Naval Academy."}, {"zh-tw": "那時，新聞開始播報這件事一個老奶奶和警務人員發生了爭執她並不暴力", "en": "News reports startedcoming up about this situation, where this woman was arguingwith a police officer.
