Now, unfortunately, there are too many of you for me to do the statistics properly. But it looks like -- I'm guessing -- that it'll be about 60 percent of the room because that's roughly the fraction of developed world population that have some sort of vision correction.", "en": " 如果你有戴眼鏡或隱形眼鏡，請你把手舉起來 或是有做過雷射視力矯正手術？ 嗯，舉手的人數很多，我沒有辦法做很精確的統計 但是看起來，我猜，舉手的人大約佔百分之六十 因為這大約就是在已開發國家中 做過視力矯正的比例"}, {"zh-tw": " The World Health Organization estimates -- well, they make various estimates of the number of people who need glasses -- the lowest estimate is 150 million people. They also have an estimate of around a billion.", "en": " 世界衛生組織估計 嗯，針對眼鏡的需求，他們做過各式各樣的估計 最保守的估計約有一億五千萬人需要眼鏡 最高的估計是十億人"}, {"zh-tw": " But in fact, I would argue that we've just done an experiment here and now, which shows us that the global need for corrective eyewear is around half of any population. And the problem of poor vision, is actually not just a health problem, it's also an educational problem, and it's an economic problem, and it's a quality of life problem.", "en": " 但是事實上，就我們剛才所做的實驗來看 需要矯正視力的人口 約佔全世界人口的一半以上 視力的問題，不僅僅是健康的問題 還是教育問題 也是經濟問題，更是生活品質的問題"}, {"zh-tw": " Glasses are not very expensive.

How do you solve this problem? I came up with a solution to this problem, and I came up with a solution based on adaptive optics for this.
