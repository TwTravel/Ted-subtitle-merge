It gives us equal opportunitiesto display our talents and choose what we wantto do with our lives, based on interest and not basedon potential barriers.", "en": " 倘若發生了殘疾會怎樣？ 他們會和我一樣覺得被排除在外嗎？ 得以接觸資訊使我們能蓬勃發展， 給我們一展長才的均等機會， 讓我們得以選擇想要的生活， 依循興趣，而不受限於潛在的障礙。"}, {"zh-tw": " When we give people the opportunityto succeed without limits, that will lead to personal fulfillmentand prospering life.
