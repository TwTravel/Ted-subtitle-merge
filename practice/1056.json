We've been talking a lot about the horrific impacts of plasticon the planet and on other species, but plastic hurts people, too -- especially poor people.", "en": " 我很榮幸能在這裡 也很榮幸能談論這個問題 我認爲這是個很嚴重的問題。 我們已經討論過很多 關於塑膠對地球和其他物種 帶來的可怕的影響， 但是塑膠也會危害人類 特別是貧窮的人。"}, {"zh-tw": " And both in the production of plastic, the use of plasticand the disposal of plastic, the people who havethe bull's-eye on their foreheads are poor people. People got very upset when the BP oil spill happened, for very good reason.", "en": " 在塑膠的生産過程 或是使用及丟棄的過程中 直接受害的最嚴重的 都是貧窮的人。 大家對於英國石油油井的原油外泄 感到很憤怒 這是可以體會的。"}, {"zh-tw": " People thought, \"Oh, my God. This is terrible, this oil --it's in the water.", "en": " 大家會想，“天哪， 這外泄的油太可怕了， 流進水裏，裏面的生態"}, {"zh-tw": " It's going to destroythe living systems there. People are going to be hurt.", "en": " 將會被破壞殆盡。 人們也會蒙受其害。"}, {"zh-tw": " This is a terrible thing, this oil is going to hurtthe people in the Gulf.\" What people don't think about is: What if the oil had made itsafely to shore? What if the oil actually gotwhere it was trying to go? Not only would it have been burnedin engines and added to global warming, but there's a place called \"Cancer Alley,\" and the reason it's called \"Cancer Alley\" is because the petrochemical industry takes that oil and turns it into plastic and in the process, kills people. It shortens the lives of the peoplewho live there in the Gulf.", "en": " 進而影響墨西哥灣周圍人們的生計 這是很可怕的一件事。” 人們沒想過的是 如果原油安全地被運輸上岸 順利地到達目的地（煉油厰）會怎樣呢？ 石油不只會被送進引擎燃燒 變成廢氣造成全球暖化 還有個地方叫“癌症帶” 爲什麽叫“癌症帶”呢？ 那是因爲石化業 用原油製造塑膠 在生産的過程毒害了當地的居民。 住在墨西哥灣區的人們壽命因此而縮短。"}, {"zh-tw": " So oil and petrochemicals are notjust a problem when there's a spill; they're a problem when there's not. And what we don't often appreciate is the price that poor people pay for us to have these disposable products.", "en": " 所以石油化工業即使在油井不漏油的時候 也是個問題製造者。 我們通常不知道的是 貧窮的人們為我們丟棄的塑膠 所付出的代價。"}, {"zh-tw": " The other thingwe often don't appreciate is, it's not just at the point of productionthat poor people suffer. Poor people also sufferat the point of use.", "en": " 還有一件我們通常也不知道的事 人們不止在生産的過程中受害 在使用的過程 人們也會受害。"}, {"zh-tw": " Those of us who earna certain income level, we have something called choice. The reason why you wantto work hard and have a job and not be poor and broke is so you can have choices,economic choices.", "en": " 收入所得超過一定水準的人 有選擇的能力。 我們之所以會想要努力工作 不想陷入貧窮或破產 是因爲我們在經濟上想要保有選擇的能力。"}, {"zh-tw": " We actually get a chanceto choose not to use products that have dangerous,poisonous plastic in them. Other people who are poordon't have those choices.", "en": " 我們有能力去選擇 不去使用某些產品 那些包含危險的有毒的塑膠的產品。 但是窮人們是沒有選擇的"}, {"zh-tw": " So low-income people often are the ones who are buying the products that havethose dangerous chemicals in them that their children are using. Those are the people who wind upingesting a disproportionate amount of this poisonous plastic in using it.", "en": " 所以低收入的人們經常也是 去買那些内含有毒化學成分的產品 來給他們小孩用的人。 到頭來這些人 吸收了或是使用了 比一般人更多的有毒塑膠。"}, {"zh-tw": " And people say, \"Well, they shouldjust buy a different product.\" Well, the problem with being pooris you don't have those choices. You often have to buythe cheapest products.", "en": " 可能有人會說，“他們應該買其它較安全的產品。” 但是問題是身為窮人，你是沒有其他的選擇的。 你通常只能買最便宜的產品"}, {"zh-tw": " The cheapest productsare often the most dangerous. And if that weren't bad enough -- if it wasn't just the productionof plastic that's giving people cancer in places like Cancer Alley, and shortening lives and hurtingpoor kids at the point of use -- at the point of disposal, once again, it's poor peoplewho bear the burden.", "en": " 而最便宜的產品通常也是最危險的。 如果這還不夠糟糕，還有更慘的： 不止在塑膠的生産過程裏 會帶給人們癌症，形成“癌症帶”，縮短性命 窮苦人家的小孩在使用的過程也會受害 甚至在丟棄的時候 再一次地，又是窮苦人家 首當其害。"}, {"zh-tw": " Often, we think we're doing a good thing: You're in your office, drinkingyour bottled water or whatever it is, and you think to yourself,\"I'm going to throw this away. No -- I'm going to be virtuous.I'm going to put it in the blue bin.\" You think, \"I put mine in the blue bin.\" And then you lookat your colleague and say, \"Why, you cretin!You put yours in the white bin.\" And we use that as a moral tickle.", "en": " 我們常常以爲我們在做正確的事 你在你的辦公室 你在喝一瓶水還是什麽的 你在想，“我要把這瓶子丟掉。 不，我要做做功德 把這個瓶子放進藍色的資源回收桶。” 你想，“我把我的瓶子放進藍桶子裏。” 接下來你看著你的同事說 “爲什麽你這個低能兒 把你的塑膠瓶放在白色的桶子裏？” 我們把這個動作當作一個道德標簽"}, {"zh-tw": " We feel so good about ourselves. If we -- well, OK, I'm just ... me.", "en": " 我們也因此自我感覺超好。 還可能原諒自己"}, {"zh-tw": " Not you, but I feel this way often. And so we kind of havethis moral feel-good moment.", "en": " 可能你不會，但是我是這麽覺得的。 我們都因此有道德上感覺良好的時候。"}, {"zh-tw": " But if we were to be ableto follow that little bottle on its journey, we would be shockedto discover that, all too often, that bottle is going to be put on a boat, it's going to go all the wayacross the ocean at some expense, and it's going to wind upin a developing country, often China. I think in our minds, we imagine somebody's going to takethe little bottle and say, \"Oh, little bottle! We're so happyto see you, little bottle.\" \"You've served so well.\" He's given a little bottle massage, a little bottle medal.", "en": " 但是要是我們跟著這個小塑膠瓶 看看它接下來的旅程 常常，我們會很吃驚地發現 塑膠瓶會被裝上船 花費一些運費 飄洋過海 最後到達一個開發中國家--通常是中國 在我們的心裏我們想象 有個人會拿起瓶子說，“噢，小小瓶子， 我們真高興見到你這個小瓶子。” “你的任務是如此完美地達成了” 小瓶子得到了獎勵 還有小瓶子獎章。"}, {"zh-tw": " And they say, \"What wouldyou like to do next?\" The little bottle says,\"I just don't know ...\" But that's not actually what happens. You know? That bottle winds up getting burned.", "en": " 那個人又說，“接下來你想做什麽？” 小瓶子說，“我還不知道。” 但事實並不是如此。 這個瓶子 最後是被燒掉。"}, {"zh-tw": " The recycling of plasticin many developing countries means the incineration of the plastic,the burning of the plastic, which releases incredible toxic chemicals and, once again, kills people. And so, poor peoplewho are making these products in petrochemical centerslike Cancer Alley, poor people who are consumingthese products disproportionately, and then poor people who,even at the tail end of the recycling, are having their lives shortened.", "en": " 在很多開發中國家，塑膠資源的回收 就意味著把塑膠燒掉 而在燒塑膠的過程中 會散發無可計量的有毒化學物質 再一次， 是貧窮的人 在“癌症帶“這樣的石化中心 生産這一類塑膠產品； 是貧窮的人高度地消費這一類的產品； 最後還是貧窮的人 在資源回收的末端 看著他們的性命被縮短"}, {"zh-tw": " They're all being harmed -- greatly -- by this addiction that we haveto disposability. Now, you think to yourself --I know how you are -- you say, \"That sure is terriblefor those poor people.", "en": " 嚴重地被侵害 就只因爲我們太習慣於 用過即丟的生活方式。 現在你會想--因爲我很了解大家-- “對這些人來説 這真是太可怕了。"}, {"zh-tw": " It's just awful. Those poor people. I hope someone doessomething to help them.\" But what we don't understand is -- here we are in Los Angeles.", "en": " 太慘了， 這些窮人們。 我希望有人能幫幫他們。” 我們不了解的是 在洛杉磯的我們"}, {"zh-tw": " We worked very hardto get the smog reduction happening here in Los Angeles. But guess what? Because they're doing so muchdirty production in Asia now, because the environmental lawsdon't protect the people in Asia now, almost all of the clean air gainsand the toxic air gains that we've achieved here in California have been wiped outby dirty air coming over from Asia.", "en": " 很努力地要降低 在本地煙霧的排放 但是你猜怎麽樣？ 因爲現在在亞洲有這麽多的骯髒的工廠 因爲環境保護法案 現在還無法保護在亞洲的人們 我們在加州 辛辛苦苦維護的清潔空氣 和消除的髒空氣 全被亞洲飄過來的髒空氣一筆勾銷。"}, {"zh-tw": " So we all are being hit.We all are being impacted. It's just that the poor peopleget it first and worst.", "en": " 最終我們還是受到影響 但是首當其衝的還是貧窮的人們。"}, {"zh-tw": " But the dirty production,the burning of toxins, the lack of environmentalstandards in Asia, is actually creating so muchdirty air pollution, it's coming across the ocean, and has erased our gainshere in California. We're back where we were in the 1970s.", "en": " 因爲不乾淨的生産過程，燃燒所釋放的有毒物質 和亞洲的缺乏環保 產生了許多空氣污染 飄洋過海而來完全抵消了我們在加州的努力。 我們反而退回到70年代的標準。"}, {"zh-tw": " And so we're on one planet, and we have to be able to getto the root of these problems. The root of this problem, in my view, is the idea of disposability itself.", "en": " 我們在同一個地球上 所以我們必須找到問題的根源。 在我看來，問題的根源 在於用過即丟這個觀念上。"}, {"zh-tw": " You see, if you understand the link between what we're doingto poison and pollute the planet and what we're doing to poor people, you arrive at a very troublingbut also very helpful insight: In order to trash the planet, you have to trash people. But if you create a worldwhere you don't trash people, you can't trash the planet.", "en": " 看，你如果了解 我們對地球 所造成的污染 和我們對窮人帶來的影響之間是有關聯的 你就會得到這個 令人不安但很有幫助的看法： 要把地球作廢 你得先把人類作廢。 但是如果你能創造一個珍惜人類的世界 你也就做到了珍惜地球。"}, {"zh-tw": " So now we are at a moment where the coming togetherof social justice as an idea and ecology as an idea, we finally can now see that they are really,at the end of the day, one idea. And it's the idea that we don't havedisposable anything.", "en": " 我們社會進步到了 一方面重視社會正義 一方面也要環境保護 但我們也終於看出來 這其實是一體的兩個面。 這兩個面指的事就是，拒絕用過就丟。"}, {"zh-tw": " We don't have disposable resources. We don't have disposable species.", "en": " 我們的資源不該是用過即丟的 其他的生物也不是用過即丟的。"}, {"zh-tw": " And we don't havedisposable people, either. We don't have a throwaway planet, and we don't have throwawaychildren -- it's all precious.", "en": " 人類更不是用過即丟的。 我們的地球不是用過即丟的 就像我們的下一代一樣，都是很珍貴的。"}, {"zh-tw": " And as we all begin to come backto that basic understanding, new opportunities for actionbegin to emerge. Biomimicry, which is an emerging science, winds up being a very importantsocial justice idea.", "en": " 一旦我們有了這樣的基礎認識 新的行動機會也跟著出現了。 那就是“仿生學” 這是一樣新概念 剛出現的新科學 也是一個很重要的社會正義的概念"}, {"zh-tw": " People who are justlearning about this stuff: biomimicry means respectingthe wisdom of all species. Democracy, by the way, means respecting the wisdomof all people -- we'll get to that.", "en": " 人們也才剛開始了解。 仿生學是指 尊重所有物種的智慧。 順便一提，民主， 是指尊重所有人民的智慧。"}, {"zh-tw": " But biomimicry meansrespecting the wisdom of all species. It turns out we're a prettyclever species.", "en": " 仿生學是指尊重所有物種的智慧。 我們人類被認定是很聰明的物種"}, {"zh-tw": " We have this big cortex,we're pretty proud of ourselves.

I'm going to getvacuums and furnaces and drag stuff out of the ground and get things hotand poison and pollute ...

You're so clever,but you're not as clever as a clam. A clamshell is hard.", "en": " 你還說你很聰明嗎？ 你還比不上一顆蛤蚌呢 蛤蚌的殼很硬"}, {"zh-tw": " There's no vacuums.There's no big furnaces. There's no poison. There's no pollution.", "en": " 不需要鼓風機，不需要大的熔爐 不產生有毒物質，也沒有污染。"}, {"zh-tw": " It turns out that other speciesfigured out a long time ago how to create many of the things we need using biological processesthat nature knows how to use well.

I mean actually respecting them,respecting what they've achieved.", "en": " 我不是說要虐待小動物 我是說要去尊重，尊重牠們的成就。"}, {"zh-tw": " That's called biomimicry, and that opens the doorto zero waste production; zero pollution production; that we could actually enjoy a high quality of life,a high standard of living, without trashing the planet.

We would have a green society that Dr. King would be proud of.", "en": " 我們也會有一個不同的經濟 我們會有金博士都引以爲傲的 環保綠色社會。"}, {"zh-tw": " That should be the goal. And the way that we get thereis to first of all recognize that the idea of disposability not only hurts the specieswe've talked about, but it even corrupts our own society.", "en": " 這應該是我們的目標。 而要達到這個目標 大家要先認知這個用過即丟的概念 不止傷害了 我們談到的物種 還會腐化我們的社會。"}, {"zh-tw": " We're so proud to live here in California.

And yet, as a movement that has to broadenits constituency, that has to grow, that has to reach outbeyond our natural comfort zone, one of the challengesto the success of this movement, of getting rid of things like plasticand helping the economy shift, is people look at our movementwith some suspicion.", "en": " 所以這又跟我們這種 只用一次、用過即丟的壞習慣相呼應。 然而 要成爲一個活動 就要拓廣活動的延續性 就要使這個活動能成長 要使這個活動能超越其傳統範圍 要把消除塑膠或幫助塑膠經濟轉型 這個活動能否成功，我們常遇到的挑戰為 人們常常對我們抱持著懷疑的態度。"}, {"zh-tw": " And they ask a question,and the question is: How can these people be so passionate? A poor person, a low-income person,somebody in Cancer Alley, somebody in Watts, somebody in Harlem,somebody on an Indian reservation, might say to themselves --and rightfully so -- \"How can these people be so passionate about making sure that a plastic bottlehas a second chance in life, or an aluminum can has a second chance, and yet, when my child gets in troubleand goes to prison, he doesn't get a second chance?\" \"How can this movementbe so passionate about saying we don't have throwaway stuff,no throwaway dead materials, and yet accept throwaway lives and throwaway communitieslike Cancer Alley?\" And so, we now get a chanceto be truly proud of this movement. When we take on topics like this, it gives us that extra callto reach out to other movements and to become more inclusive and to grow, and we can finally get out ofthis crazy dilemma that we've been in.", "en": " 人們常常問一個問題： 這些人怎麽會這麽有熱情這麽執著？ 一個窮人、低收入戶、住在癌症帶的人 住在瓦茨區（洛杉磯的窮人區） 住在哈林區（紐約的窮人區），住在印第安保留區的人 他們會這麽說，倒也沒錯 “這些人怎麽會這麽執著地 要確認 一個塑膠瓶 還可以回收再利用， 或是一個鋁罐可以再有第二個生命， 然而，我的小孩惹了麻煩 被送進了監獄 卻沒有第二次的機會？“ 我們怎麽可以如此熱情地倡導 資源物質的再回收利用 然而任由 人命的廢置或癌症帶的存在？ 所以我們現在有個機會 能讓我們真正為這個活動感到驕傲 如果我們選擇這個為我們奮鬥的議題 這給我們額外的動機 來向其他的活動伸展 也使得我們變得更有包含性、也更能成長。 而我們也終於能夠跳出以前那個無法兩全的局面。"}, {"zh-tw": " Most of you are good, softhearted people. When you were younger,you cared about the whole world, and at some point, somebody saidyou had to pick an issue, you had to boil your lovedown to an issue.", "en": " 你們大部分的人是好的，心很軟的 當你們年輕時，你們關心全世界 甚至於在某個階段 有人說，你必須選擇一個議題來關心、奮鬥 一個可以把你的愛加諸其上的議題。"}, {"zh-tw": " \"Can't love the whole world -- you've got to work on treesor you've got to work on immigration.

Pick.", "en": " 你不可能愛全世界 所以你選擇植樹、 選擇移民政策 你必須做篩選，只選一個議題來關心。 基本上他們的意思是 “你是要去擁抱一棵樹 還是一個小孩？選吧。"}, {"zh-tw": " Are you going to hug a tree? Or are you going to hug a child? Pick.\" Well, when you start workingon issues like plastic, you realize the whole thing is connected. And luckily, most of us are blessedto have two arms -- we can hug both.", "en": " 你是要去擁抱一棵樹 還是一個小孩？選吧。” 但是你要是選擇塑膠為你的議題 你將了解很多事是環環相扣的 很幸運地，我們都有兩條手臂 我們小孩和樹都可以擁抱。"}, {"zh-tw": " Thank you very much.", "en": " 謝謝大家。"}], "title": "Van Jones The Economic Injustice Of Plastic"}
