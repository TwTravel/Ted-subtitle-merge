I've always managed my own extensions so it never even occurred to me to read the instructions, but I did finally figure it out. I had to figure it out, because along with the invitation came the frightening reminder that there would be no projector, so bringing those carousels would no longer be necessary but some alternate form of communication would.

I'm going to talk about Rome.", "en": " 我選擇了後者 今天我要來談談羅馬"}, {"zh-tw": " Now, why would I care about Rome, particularly?

It changed my life.", "en": " 爲什麽我對羅馬有特殊情感呢？ 嗯，我在羅德島設計學院(RISD)念建築時 大約是六零年代後期 幸運的是，我當學生的最後一年，也就是第五年 是在羅馬度過的，這改變了我的一生"}, {"zh-tw": " Not the least reason was the fact that I had spent those first four years living at home, driving into RISD everyday, driving back.

Unfortunately, just across the road from it or quite close by is the Column of Marcus Aurelius, and the diameter of the dirigible makes an impression, as you can see, as she starts trying to read the story that spirals around the Column of Marcus Aurelius -- gets a little too close, nudges it.", "en": " 這樣展示山丘上流淌下的河流、小溪真好 不幸的是，路對面恰好就是 馬可·奧里略圓柱 你現在知道飛船的直徑有多大了 正如你所見，她開始閱讀圓柱上環繞的故事 靠得有點太近了，就碰了它一下"}, {"zh-tw": " This gives me a chance to suggest to you the structure of the Column of Marcus Aurelius, which is really no more than a pile of quarters high -- thick quarters. Over the Piazza of Saint Ignacio, completely ruining the symmetry, but that aside a spectacular place to visit. A spectacular framework, inside of which you see, usually, extraordinary blue sky.", "en": " 這個場景讓我能畫出 馬可·奧里略圓柱的結構 其實不比一堆25美分的硬幣高 又高又厚的硬幣，在圣依那爵廣場上空看來-- 整個毀了對稱感，可是除了這點-- 是個非常棒的地方。 廣場是個非常棒的畫框，透過那里面，通常來說 你看到特別藍的天。"}, {"zh-tw": " Over the Pantheon and the 26-foot diameter Oculus. She parks her dirigible, lowers the anchor rope and climbs down for a closer look inside.", "en": " 在萬神殿和它直徑為26英尺的天孔上方 她停下飛船，放下纜繩 爬下來近距離地觀察。"}, {"zh-tw": " The text here is right side and upside down so that you are forced to turn the book around, and you can see it from ground point of view and from her point of view -- looking in the hole, getting a different kind of perspective, moving you around the space. Particularly appropriate in a building that can contain perfectly a sphere dimensions of the diameter being the same as the distance from the center of the floor to the center of the Oculus. Unfortunately for her, the anchor line gets tangled around the feet of some Boy Scouts who are visiting the Pantheon, and they are immediately yanked out and given an extraordinary but terrifying tour of some of the domes of Rome, which would, from their point of view, naturally be hanging upside down.", "en": " 文字從右起，又是上下顛倒的，你不得不 把書倒過來，於是你能從地面的角度 和她的角度，望向天孔 這倒是种別樣的視角。 這讓你在空間中移動。而尤其適合 在一棟正好包含着球體的建築里， 直徑和尺度都和 從地面的中心到天孔的中心的距離相等。 有點不妙，纜繩纏在了 一些正在參觀萬神殿的小孩子們的腳上 他們就立刻被拽了出去 開始一段特別又驚險的觀光旅行 從他們的角度看來羅馬城的石拱 自然而然就是上下顛倒的"}, {"zh-tw": " They bail out as soon as they get to the top of Saint Ivo, that little spiral structure you see there. She continues on her way over Piazza Navona.", "en": " 他們一到達圣依華教堂就下船了， 就是那個螺旋形的結構 她則繼續遊覽到了那佛那廣場"}, {"zh-tw": " Notices a lot of activity at the Tre Scalini restaurant, is reminded that it is lunchtime and she's hungry. They keep on motoring towards the Campo de' Fiori, which they soon reach. Ajax the dog is put in a basket and lowered with a list of food into the marketplace, which flourishes there until about one in the afternoon, and then is completely removed and doesn't appear again until six or seven the following morning.", "en": " 在Tres Palini飯館看到一大群人 這提醒她該吃午飯了，她也餓了 他們繼續向鮮花廣場行駛 很快就到了。小狗阿賈克斯被放在籃子里 吊下來，隨身帶了張食品採購清單就進入了市場 市場一直紅火到下午一點 隨後就一溜煙地收攤了 直到第二天六、七點才會回來。"}, {"zh-tw": " Anyway, the pooch gets back to the dirigible with the stuff. Unfortunately, when she goes to unwrap the prosciutto, Ajax makes a lunge for it.", "en": " 還別說，小狗還真把東西帶回了飛船。 不幸的是當她撕開火腿包裝的時候， 阿賈克斯撲了上來"}, {"zh-tw": " She's managed to save the prosciutto, but in the process she loses the tablecloth, which you can see flying away in the upper left-hand corner. They continue without their tablecloth, looking for a place to land this thing so that they can actually have lunch.", "en": " 最終火腿倒是得救了， 可是搏斗過程中桌布掉了下去 你看它飄到左上角去了。 他們決定乾脆就不要桌布了吧。 於是想要找個地方降落吃午飯"}, {"zh-tw": " They eventually discover a huge wall that's filled with small holes, ideal for docking a dirigible because you've got a place to tie up. Turns out to be the exterior wall -- that part of it that remains -- of the Coliseum, so they park themselves there and have a terrific lunch and have a spectacular view.", "en": " 最后發現了一堵巨墻 上面都是小洞，用來停泊非常挺理想的 因為你有地方繫繩子 回頭發現那居然是 羅馬競技場殘留的外牆。 他們就在此停船，飽餐一頓 順便欣賞美景。"}, {"zh-tw": " At the end of lunch, they untie the anchor, they set off through the Baths of Caracalla and over the walls of the city and then an abandoned gatehouse and decide to take one more look at the Pyramid of Cestius, which has this lightning rod on top. Unfortunately, that's a problem: they get a little too close, and when you're in a dirigible you have to be very careful about spikes.", "en": " 吃過了飯，他們又起錨出發了 穿過卡拉卡拉浴場，飛越了城墻 從一個廢棄的樓門裏面橫貫而過。 接著又要去看一眼賽斯提烏斯的金字塔 它頂上插了桿避雷針。 這時麻煩來了：他們靠得有點太近了-- 開飛船的時候 切記要小心尖頭物體。"}, {"zh-tw": " So that sort of brings her little story to a conclusion. Marcello, on the other hand, is sort of a lazy guy, but he's not due at work until about noon.", "en": " 她的小故事看來要告一段落了。 另一個人，馬爾切洛大概是個懶漢， 不過他中午才需要去上班。"}, {"zh-tw": " So, the alarm goes off and it's five to 12 or so. He gets up, leaps onto his scooter, races through the city past the church of Santa Maria della Pace, down the alleys, through the streets that tourists may be wandering through, disturbing the quiet backstreet life of Rome at every turn.", "en": " 鬧鐘響的時候已經11點55分左右了。 他就起床，上車，揚長而去 駛過和平聖母教堂， 過街穿巷 從遊人身邊掠過。 每次上班都把羅馬靜謐的後街生活完全打亂。"}, {"zh-tw": " That speed with which he is moving, I hope I have suggested in this little image, which, again, can be turned around and read from both sides because there's text on the bottom and text on the top, one of which is upside down in this image. So, he keeps on moving, approaching an unsuspecting waiter who is trying to deliver two plates of linguine in a delicate white wine clam sauce to diners who are sitting at a table just outside of a restaurant in the street.", "en": " 我希望這幅圖能表現這個傢伙的速度-- 又是一張正著倒著都能看的圖， 因為下面上面都有字 而有一邊的字是倒著印刷的。 他一路向前，接近了一個毫不知情的侍者 他正端著兩碟子扁麵條 澆了种精緻的白葡萄酒蛤蜊醬汁 他正走向酒店靠近街邊座位上的客人。"}, {"zh-tw": " Waiter catches on, but it's too late. And Marcello keeps moving in his scooter.", "en": " 侍者反應過來了，不過為時已晚。 馬爾切洛一往無前。"}, {"zh-tw": " Everything he sees from this point on is slightly affected by the linguine, but keeps on moving because this guy's got a job to do. Removes some scaffolding. One of the reasons Rome remains the extraordinary place it is that because of scaffolding and the determination to maintain the fabric, it is a city that continues to grow and adapt to the needs of the particular time in which it finds itself, or we find it.", "en": " 從現在起他看到的一切都跟麵條搭上了點小關系。 不過還得繼續走，上班要緊。 一路上拆了些腳手架--它們是 羅馬依然保留著獨特風韻的原因： 人們的修繕施工以及保護 城市規劃結構的決心。羅馬繼續成長 來適應不同時代的需要 它自覺地如此，我們也加以推動。"}, {"zh-tw": " Right through the Piazza della Rotonda, in front of the Pantheon -- again wreaking havoc -- and finally getting to work. Marcello, as it turns out, is the driver of the number 64 bus, and if you've been on the number 64 bus, you know that it's driven with the same kind of exuberance as Marcello demonstrated on his scooter.", "en": " 你看他橫穿羅通達廣場， 在萬神殿前弄得一陣雞飛狗跳，終於到了。 我們發現馬爾切洛 是64路巴士的司機。 如果你坐過64路巴士你就會知道 這巴士開得 跟馬爾切洛的摩托車一個德性。"}, {"zh-tw": " And finally Carletto. You see his apartment in the upper left-hand corner. He's looking at his table; he's planning to propose this evening to his girlfriend of 40 years, and he wants it to be perfect.", "en": " 最后是卡爾萊託--他的公寓在左上角 他正凝視著桌子。 今晚要向他談了40年的女友求婚 他希望一切都做得盡善盡美"}, {"zh-tw": " He's got candles out, he's got flowers in the middle and he's trying to figure out where to put the plates and the glasses. But he's not happy; something's wrong.", "en": " 他擺開了蠟燭，放好了鮮花 正想著該把杯盤放在哪裡。 可是他並不開心--還缺點什麽。"}, {"zh-tw": " The phone rings anyway, he's called to the palazzo. He saunters -- he saunters at a good clip, but as compared to all the traveling we've just seen, he's sauntering.", "en": " 電話響了--叫他去palazzo。 他快步走去 不過跟馬爾切洛相比，他簡直是在晃蕩。"}, {"zh-tw": " Everybody knows Carletto, because he's in entertainment, actually; he's in television. He's actually in television repair, which is why people know him.", "en": " 卡爾萊託真是無人不曉：他是娛樂界的-- 準確地説，是搞電視的。 大家都認識他是因為他負責修電視。"}, {"zh-tw": " So they all have his number. He arrives at the palazzo, arrives at the big front door.", "en": " 每個人都有他的電話號碼。 終於到了，他來到大門那裏"}, {"zh-tw": " Enters the courtyard and talks to the custodian, who tells him that there's been a disaster in the palazzo; nobody's TVs are working and there's a big soccer game coming up, and the crowd is getting a little restless and a little nervous. He goes down to the basement and starts to check the wiring, and then gradually works his way up to the top of the building, apartment by apartment, checking every television, checking every connection, hoping to find out what this problem is.", "en": " 走進院子，和看門人聊了起來 看門人説樓裏出了大事 電視機全都壞了 可是即將有一場足球大賽 大家都按耐不住，怕錯過了比賽。 於是他下到地下室檢查電線 從那兒一路檢查到樓頂， 挨家挨戶地檢查每一台電視機 一台一台地檢查 想找出問題的所在"}, {"zh-tw": " He works his way up, finally, the grand staircase and then a smaller staircase until he reaches the attic. He opens the window of the attic, of course, and there's a tablecloth wrapped around the building's television antenna.", "en": " 他一直往上查，終於到了主樓梯 然後爬上了一個小些的樓梯，來到了閣樓 打開閣樓的窗戶，居然，有張桌布 掛在整個樓的電視信號接收天線上。"}, {"zh-tw": " He removes it, the problems are solved, everybody in the palazzo is happy. And of course, he also solves his own problem.", "en": " 他把桌布拿掉，問題就解決了 樓裏的每個人都很開心。 並且他也解決了自己的問題。"}, {"zh-tw": " All he has to do now, with a perfect table, is wait for her to arrive. That was the first attempt, but it didn't seem substantial enough to convey whatever it was I wanted to convey about Rome.", "en": " 桌子布置好了以後，他現在要做的 就是等她出現。 這是我的第一個嘗試，不過好像份量還不夠 傳達我想表達的對羅馬的理解"}, {"zh-tw": " So I thought, well, I'll just do piazzas, and I'll get inside and underneath and I'll show these things growing and show why they're shaped the way they are and so on. And then I thought, that's too complicated. No, I'll just take my favorite bits and pieces and I'll put them inside the Pantheon but keep the scale, so you can see the top of Sant'Ivo and the Pyramid of Cestius and the Tempietto of Bramante all side by side in this amazing space.", "en": " 所以我想，好吧，我就先畫廣場， 然後鑽進去、挖下去 展示那些深層中發展著的 塑造了這座城市的力量。 後來我又覺得太復雜了。不行。 我暫且用我最喜歡的那些地方 把它們畫到萬神殿裡去，保持原有尺寸 你就能看到圣依沃堂和賽斯提烏斯金字塔 還有布拉曼特的小禮拜堂的尖頂，都在這裏並列。"}, {"zh-tw": " Now that's one drawing, so I thought maybe it's time for Piranesi to meet Escher. You see that I'm beginning to really lose control here and also hope.", "en": " 這又是一幅畫。 呵呵，我想也許是時候讓皮拉內西見見埃爾舍了。 其實你看我有點控制不住作品的走向了， 信心也隨之減退。"}, {"zh-tw": " There's a very thin blue line of exhaust that sort of runs through this thing that would be kind of the trail that holds it all together. Then I thought, \"Wait a minute, what am I doing?\" A book is not only a neat way of collecting and storing information, it's a series of layers.", "en": " 而有一縷藍色的煙氣 仿佛是貫穿整書的線索，把一切串在了一起。 我突然意識到：等等，我在幹嘛呢？ 書不光是積存信息的便捷工具 它還是一系列的層次。"}, {"zh-tw": " I mean, you always peel one layer off another; we think of them as pages, doing it a certain way. But think of them as layers. I mean, Rome is a place of layers -- horizontal layers, vertical layers -- and I thought, well just peeling off a page would allow me to -- if I got you thinking about it the right way -- would allow me to sort of show you the depth of layers.", "en": " 你總是一層層地剝開來-- 一頁頁書，某種程度上是在“剝”。 想象那些層次。羅馬是個有層次地地方-- 橫向地層次，縱向地層次。 而我想，如果“剝”開一頁書就能-- 如果你跟著我地思路-- 就能展示出這些層次地深度就好了"}, {"zh-tw": " The stucco on the walls of most of the buildings in Rome covers the scars; the scars of centuries of change as these structures have been adapted rather than being torn down. If I do a foldout page on the left-hand side and let you just unfold it, you see behind it what I mean by scar tissue.", "en": " 羅馬的大多數建築用牆面的灰泥 把許多個世紀的傷痕遮掩了 這些建築一直在改變用途 而不是被拆掉 如果我在左半頁做一個摺疊頁， 你把它打開，就看見了所謂傷口下面的組織。"}, {"zh-tw": " You can see that in 1635, it became essential to make smaller windows because the bad guys were coming or whatever. Adaptations all get buried under the stucco.", "en": " 比如說在1635年的一層，你就能看到 把窗戶改小的重要性 因為壞人們要來了，或者是別的什麽原因。 這些變化都埋藏在了表面的灰泥之下。"}, {"zh-tw": " I could peel out a page of this palazzo to show you what's going on inside of it. But more importantly, I could also show you what it looks like at the corner of one of those magnificent buildings with all the massive stone blocks, or the fake stone blocks done with brick and stucco, which is more often the case.", "en": " 我只要剝掉這棟樓的一層你就知道裏面發生了什麽 可是更重要的是，這還能告訴你 那些雄偉建築的角落裡都有些什麽 這麽些巨大的石塊-- 以及磚頭和灰泥冒充的假石塊， 它們可是更加常見。"}, {"zh-tw": " So it becomes slightly three-dimensional. I could take you down one of those narrow little streets into one of those surprising piazzas by using a double gate fold -- double foldout page -- which, if you were like me reading a pop-up book as a child, you hopefully stick your head into.", "en": " 所以這書就有點3D了。 我能把你從一條窄街上 送進一個豁然開朗的廣場，用個雙扇摺疊就可以了。 雙扇摺疊頁--如果你和我一樣 小時候喜歡讀這種立體書--你恐怕想把頭伸進去"}, {"zh-tw": " You wrap the pages around your head and are in that piazza for that brief period of time. And I've really not done anything much more complicated than make foldout pages.", "en": " 把頭埋在書裡 那一刻你就置身於廣場上了。 我實在沒有做什麽更複雜的東西了 摺疊頁已經是最複雜的了"}, {"zh-tw": " But then I thought, maybe I could be simpler here. Let's look at the Pantheon and the Piazza della Rotonda in front of it.", "en": " 不過接著我想，我或許可以簡單一點 我們來看看萬神殿和前面的羅通達廣場"}, {"zh-tw": " Here's a book completely wide open. OK, if I don't open the book the whole way, if I just open it 90 degrees, we're looking down the front of the Pantheon, and we're looking sort of at the top, more or less down on the square.", "en": " 這是完全攤開的一本書。 要不是我把書整個打開， 要是我只翻開九十度，我們就在俯視萬神殿的正面。 仿佛是從天上往下看廣場。"}, {"zh-tw": " And if I turn the book the other way, we're looking across the square at the front of the Pantheon. No foldouts, no tricks -- just a book that isn't open the whole way.", "en": " 如果我把書換一個方嚮 我們的視線就穿過廣場看到萬神殿的正面 沒有摺疊，沒有什麽把戲-- 只是本沒完全打開的書。"}, {"zh-tw": " That seemed promising. I thought, maybe I'll do it inside and I can even combine the foldouts with the only partially opened book. So we get inside the Pantheon and it grows and so on and so forth.", "en": " 我覺得這個不錯，值得試一試 甚至可以和摺疊頁結合起來使用。 於是我們進入了萬神殿內部 書就這麽擴展著，延續著。"}, {"zh-tw": " And I thought, maybe I'm on the right track, but it sort of lost its human quality. So I went back to the notion of story, which is always a good thing to have if you're trying to get people to pay attention to a book and pick up information along the way.", "en": " 我猜我可能走對路了， 只是原來的人情味丟了 所以我回到故事的表現方式 要是想讓別人集中注意 讀你的書，同時又能學到東西，講故事這個方法不錯。"}, {"zh-tw": " \"Pigeon's Progress\" struck me as a catchy title. If it was a homing pigeon, it would be called \"Homer's Odyssey.\" But it was the journey of the ...", "en": " 突然想到《鴿子之旅》是個好標題 如果這是一隻回家的鴿子 書名應該叫《荷馬的奧德修紀》 不過這是它的旅行--（笑）"}, {"zh-tw": " I mean, if a title works, use it. But it would be a journey that went through Rome and showed all the things that I like about Rome.
