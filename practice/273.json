For a time, we shared the stage with our distant cousins, Neanderthal, who clearly had some spark of awareness, but -- whether it was the increase in the size of the brain, or the development of language, or some other evolutionary catalyst -- we quickly left Neanderthal gasping for survival.", "en": " 文化來源於想像, 而這些想像 就在人類一代又一代繼傳下去時行成了 從我們的祖先猿人開始直立行走 人類已有了意識, 而且開始了一個旅程 這個旅程就是將這種意識帶到地球上每一個可居住的角落. 曾與我們共同居住在這片土地上的尼安德特人(穴居人), 已有了某種意識火花, 不管是腦部的進化 還是語言的發展 又或者是某種其它的進化因素, 我們順速地與這些只懂得尋求生存的穴居人脫離了關係."}, {"zh-tw": " By the time the last Neanderthal disappeared in Europe, 27,000 years ago, our direct ancestors had already, and for 5,000 years, been crawling into the belly of the earth, where in the light of the flickers of tallow candles, they had brought into being the great art of the Upper Paleolithic. And I spent two months in the caves of southwest France with the poet Clayton Eshleman, who wrote a beautiful book called \"Juniper Fuse.\" And you could look at this art and you could, of course, see the complex social organization of the people who brought it into being.", "en": " 當最後的穴居人在歐洲消失 於27,000年前, 我們的直係祖先已經開始了, 5000年的 向地球的中心靠近， 在獸脂蠟燭的閃光下, 他們創造了 舊石器時代早期的偉大藝術. 我在法國的西南部的洞穴呆了兩個月 期間與一位名叫克莱頓-埃爾什尼曼的詩人一起, 他曾寫過一本優美的書，叫《Juniper Fuse》 從他的這本書中, 你可以發現複雜的社會組織 還有那些創造這個組織的人們."}, {"zh-tw": " But more importantly, it spoke of a deeper yearning, something far more sophisticated than hunting magic. And the way Clayton put it was this way.", "en": " 但更重要的是：它說明了更深的渴望, 一種比搜尋魔法更複雜的東西. 克萊頓對此的解釋是："}, {"zh-tw": " He said, \"You know, clearly at some point, we were all of an animal nature, and at some point, we weren't.\" And he viewed proto-shamanism as a kind of original attempt, through ritual, to rekindle a connection that had been irrevocably lost. So, he saw this art not as hunting magic, but as postcards of nostalgia.", "en": " “曾經的某個時候 我們都帶著動物的本性，某個時候又沒有.” 他認為原始薩滿教就是這樣的一種嘗試， 通過儀式，我們又一次的點燃了一種聯繫 這種聯繫已經不見了，永遠無法挽回. 所以克萊頓覺得這種藝術不是在追尋魔法 而是我們對懷舊的明信片."}, {"zh-tw": " And viewed in that light, it takes on a whole other resonance. And the most amazing thing about the Upper Paleolithic art is that as an aesthetic expression, it lasted for almost 20,000 years.", "en": " 從這個角度來看， 這種藝術會產生一種完全相反的迴響. 而舊石器時期晚期藝術最神奇的事情 是一種對審美觀的表達, 因為它持續了進兩萬年."}, {"zh-tw": " If these were postcards of nostalgia, ours was a very long farewell indeed.

What is Buddhism but 2,500 years of empirical observation as to the nature of mind?
