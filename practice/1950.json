It's not stolen from the lines.", "en": " 不過重點是 當談到資料如何移轉 其實是公司自己交出的 並非從線上竊取"}, {"zh-tw": " But there's an important thing to remember here: even though companies pushed back, even though companies demanded, hey, let's do this through a warrant process, let's do this where we actually have some sort of legal review, some sort of basis for handing over these users' data, we saw stories in the Washington Post last year that weren't as well reported as the PRISM story that said the NSA broke in to the data center communications between Google to itself and Yahoo to itself. So even these companies that are cooperating in at least a compelled but hopefully lawful manner with the NSA, the NSA isn't satisfied with that, and because of that, we need our companies to work very hard to guarantee that they're going to represent the interests of the user, and also advocate for the rights of the users.", "en": " 不過有一點是必須記得的 就算公司抵制這樣的做法 甚至要求依法行事，像是 「我們透過正當搜索程序來進行吧」 「就這麼辦吧！」 為此我們真的研究過相關法律 好確定交出資料是合法的 關於這些用戶資訊 去年華盛頓郵報就報過了好幾則 不過稜鏡計畫的報導比較精彩 其中提到美國國安局侵入 企業資訊伺服器中心 竊取Google內部的資訊溝通 對雅虎也如法炮製 有此可見，即使公司勉強 在法律邊緣 配合美國國安局行事 但國安局要得其實更多 因此我們呼籲公司 竭盡全力 確保他們會堅守 捍衛使用權利益的立場並且極力倡導 使用者的權益維護"}, {"zh-tw": " And I think over the last year, we've seen the companies that are named on the PRISM slides take great strides to do that, and I encourage them to continue.

I want to show you the next slide here.", "en": " 克里斯：愛德華請跟我來 我想給你看下一張投影片"}, {"zh-tw": " This is a program called Boundless Informant. What is that? ES: So, I've got to give credit to the NSA for using appropriate names on this.", "en": " 這程式叫《神通線民》(Boundless Informant) 是什麼樣的程式呢？ 愛德華：我得佩服美國國安局 取了這麼貼切的名字"}, {"zh-tw": " This is one of my favorite NSA cryptonyms. Boundless Informant is a program that the NSA hid from Congress.", "en": " 在他們取的代號中這算我最愛的一個 美國國安局對國會隱瞞 《神通線民》這個程式"}, {"zh-tw": " The NSA was previously asked by Congress, was there any ability that they had to even give a rough ballpark estimate of the amount of American communications that were being intercepted. They said no. They said, we don't track those stats, and we can't track those stats.", "en": " 美國國會質詢過國安局 國家是否有能力 就美國境內 通訊監聽的數量 作粗略的估計？ 國安局回答:不行 因為他們不追蹤相關統計 也無法追蹤相關資料"}, {"zh-tw": " We can't tell you how many communications we're intercepting around the world, because to tell you that would be to invade your privacy. Now, I really appreciate that sentiment from them, but the reality, when you look at this slide is, not only do they have the capability, the capability already exists.", "en": " 所以全球有多少通訊遭到監聽 他們無可奉告 因為透露這項資訊 等同侵犯隱私 我尊重他們對此事的意見 不過實際上若你仔細研究這張投影片 國安局不但 早就有監聽能力"}, {"zh-tw": " It's already in place.

But what's especially interesting about this, about the fact that the NSA has violated their own rules, their own laws thousands of times in a single year, including one event by itself, one event out of those 2,776, that affected more than 3,000 people.", "en": " 愛德華：去年我們也參與了國會聽證會 當時感覺真奇妙 ! 當我們來自國安局的人 以及看過實際內部文件 知曉內容的人 看著官員眼睜睜立誓擔保: 國安局沒有濫用監聽權 沒有任何違反國安局的規定 與此同時，我們也知道華盛頓郵報這篇報導即將公開 不過特別令人玩味的是 關於國安局 違反業務相關規定及法律的情形 一年之中高達上千次 有個特殊的個案 在2,776件案例之中 這個單一案件就牽連了3,000人以上"}, {"zh-tw": " In another event, they intercepted all the calls in Washington, D.C., by accident. What's amazing about this, this report, that didn't get that much attention, is the fact that not only were there 2,776 abuses, the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Dianne Feinstein, had not seen this report until the Washington Post contacted her asking for comment on the report.", "en": " 在另一個事件中國安局 在意外的情況下截聽到華盛頓首府的所有電話 令人訝異的是 這份沒有引發太多關注的報告 揭露的不只是監聽權濫用案高達2,776件 而是連參議院情報委員會主席 黛安．范士丹(Dianne Feinstein)都沒看過該份報告 直到華盛頓郵報聯絡上她 請她就此發表看法"}, {"zh-tw": " And she then requested a copy from the NSA and received it, but had never seen this before that. What does that say about the state of oversight in American intelligence when the chairman of theSenate Intelligence Committee has no idea that the rules are being broken thousands of times every year?

I mean, look, if you've done nothing wrong, you've got nothing to worry about.", "en": " 她才從美國國安局 要到一份副本 不過之前她毫不知情 美國情治單位怠忽職守的程度 由此可見一般 竟連參議院情報委員會主席 都不知道 每年有數千件的違規情事 克里斯：人們對相關爭議的其中一個反應是 坦白說，我們為何要在意 這些監控措施？ 我的意思是，若問心無愧 有什麼好擔心的？"}, {"zh-tw": " What's wrong with that point of view? ES: Well, so the first thing is, you're giving up your rights.
