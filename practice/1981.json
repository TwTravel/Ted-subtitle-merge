The incident of shark engagements on humans is escalating worldwide.", "en": " 然而，澳大利亞西部並不是唯一飽受鯊魚困擾的地區 鯊魚襲擊人類的問題 在全世界不斷惡化"}, {"zh-tw": " And so it's not surprising, perhaps, that in July of this year, Shark Attack Mitigation Systems in collaboration with the University of WesternAustralia Oceans Institute made an announcement which captured the attention of the worldwide media and of ocean users worldwide, and that was around the development of technology to mitigate or reduce the risk of shark attack based on the science of what sharks can see. And I have for you today the story of that journey, but also the notion that science can be as powerful as a translator as it can be for invention.", "en": " 或許這已不足為奇 就在今年七月 鯊魚攻擊緩解系統 與西澳大學海洋學會合作 並發出通告 引起全球媒體和海洋使用者 廣泛關注 這則通告是有關一項正在發展的新技術 藉由鯊魚視覺的理論 可減輕被鯊魚襲擊的風險 今天，我將與大家分享 此項技術的研發歷程 以及闡述一個觀念，那就是 科學在發明的過程中 具有強大的影響力"}, {"zh-tw": " When we began this process, we were looking, it was about three years ago, and we'd just had the first two fatal shark attacks in Western Australia, and by chance, in a previous role, I happened to be having dinner with Harry Butler.

The first is that we mapped the characteristics, the physical characteristics of the eyes of the three main predatory sharks, so the great white, tiger and bull shark.", "en": " 我們一起完成了三項重要工作 第一項，我們測定特性 確定鯊魚眼睛的物理特性 研究物件為三種主要的食肉鯊 即大白鯊、虎鯊和牛鯊"}, {"zh-tw": " We did that genetically and we did that anatomically.

The next thing we needed to do was to convert this into wetsuits that people might actually wear, and to that end, I invited Ray Smith, a surfer, industrial designer, wetsuit designer, and in fact the guy that designedthe original Quiksilver logo, to come over and sit with the science team and interpret that science into aesthetic wetsuits thatpeople might actually wear.", "en": " 通過以上研究，我們能夠確定 兩個關鍵特性： 什麼樣圖案和形狀的泳衣能夠使穿著者 在水中隱身或者比較模糊，難以被鯊魚認出 什麼樣的圖案和形狀可能會產生 最大的對比度，但是可以極大地 分裂人的外觀 這樣人就不會被誤當作鯊魚的獵物 或鯊魚的食物 第三項，我們需要將這種想法 體現在人可以穿著的泳衣中 為了達此目的，我邀請了雷•史密斯 他是一名衝浪運動員、工業設計師和潛水服設計師 事實上，是他設計了最初的Quiksilver徽標 很榮幸，他應邀加入科學團隊 並將科技 引入供人穿著的漂亮的潛水服"}, {"zh-tw": " And here's an example of one of the first drawings.

Second iteration is the cryptic wetsuit, or the one which attempts to hide the wearer in the water column.", "en": " 你可以看到前面深暗、不透明的色塊 這樣的表面特別有效 因為背光而顯現出來的輪廓會是一個大問題 因為背光而顯現出來的輪廓會是一個大問題 接下來值得一提的保護色潛水服 這種潛水服可以把潛水夫隱藏在水層中 這種潛水服可以把潛水夫隱藏在水層中"}, {"zh-tw": " There are three panels on this suit, and in any given conditions, one or more of those panels will match the reflective spectra of the water so as to disappear fully or partially, leaving the last panel or panels to create a disruptive profile in the water column. And this one's particularly well-suited to the dive configuration, so when you're deeper under the water.", "en": " 潛水服上鑲有三色散光片 無論在何種情形下 一片或更多的散光片 具有與水層同樣的反射光譜 這樣就會全部或部分隱藏 而其餘的散光板 則可以在水層中形成模糊的輪廓 而這一款專門為 潛水者設計 非常適合在深水中穿著"}, {"zh-tw": " So we knew that we had some really solid science here.

And testing to simulate a person in a wetsuit in the water with a predatory shark in a natural environment is actually a lot harder than you might think.", "en": " 但是，還要經得起嚴峻的考驗 如果鯊魚看到這些圖案和條紋 牠們會作何反應 讓模擬人穿著潛水服 與食肉鯊一起 在天然的水下環境中進行測試 比你想象的要難得多。 （笑聲......）"}, {"zh-tw": " So we have to bait the rig, because we need to get the statistical number of samples through to get the scientific evidence, and by baiting the rig, we're obviously changing shark behavior.

In contrast to the SAMS technology rig, this is the banded one, where it's more tactile, it's more investigative, it's more apprehensive, and shows a reluctance to come straight in and go.", "en": " 大白鯊比虎鯊顯得更自信 這裡便是一條大白鯊 正在糾纏控制裝備 黑色的氯丁橡膠潛水服 垂直下降 又上來了 又一次撕咬 與採用SAMS技術的裝備相比 這套裝備採用條紋狀設計 更易感知 更便於研究 也更易於理解 看，鯊魚不情願靠近，轉身離去"}, {"zh-tw": " So, it's important for us that all the testing is done independently, and the University of W.A. is doing the testing.

Cheers.", "en": " 歡迎你，老兄 歡迎！"}, {"zh-tw": " Thanks, gentlemen. So what have we done here? Well, to my mind, rather than take a blank sheet and use science as a tool for invention, we've paid attention to the biological evidence, we've put importance to the human anecdotal evidence, and we've used science as a tool for translation, translation of something that was already there into something that we can use for the benefit of mankind.", "en": " 感謝兩位。 我們做了些什麼？ 嗯，在我看來，我們不是拿一張白紙 而是用科學作為發明的工具 我們留心於生物學證據 重視 人類軼事證據 我們把科學用作 解碼工具 將已經存在的事物 轉譯成可以造福人類的事物"}, {"zh-tw": " And it strikes me that this idea of science as a tool for translation rather than invention is one that we can apply much more widely than this in the pursuit of innovation. After all, did the Wright brothers discover manned flight, or did they observe the biological fact of flight and translate that mechanically, replicate it in a way that humans could use? As for the humble wetsuit, who knows what oceanwear will look like in two years' time, in five years' time or in 50 years' time, but with this new thinking, I'm guessing there's a fair chance it won't be pure black.", "en": " 這使我突然發現 將科學作為轉譯的工具而非發明的工具的觀點 是我們能夠更廣泛應用的 而非一味追求創新 畢竟，萊特兄弟 創造了載人飛機 還是他們是靠觀察動物飛行而得到啟示 將原理轉譯並複製到機械當中 供世人使用的呢？ 至於這微不足道的潛水服 誰曉得在未來它會變成什麼樣子 比如說，兩年後、五年後 或者五十年以後……但是按照這種新思維 我猜，有相當大的可能 未來的潛水服不會是純黑色"}, {"zh-tw": " Thank you.", "en": " 謝謝！"}], "title": "Hamish Jolly A Shark Deterrent Wetsuit And It S Not What You Think"}
