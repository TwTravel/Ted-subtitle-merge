But there's not.", "en": " 我也觀看星星， 閱讀我們所知的重力， 想當然耳，大和小的兩個系統必然有種精美而優雅的相應方式。 但可惜卻沒有。"}, {"zh-tw": " And the books would say, yeah, we understand a lotabout these two realms separately, but when we try to linkthem mathematically, everything breaks. And for 100 years, none of our ideas as to how to solvethis basically physics disaster, has ever been supported by evidence.", "en": " 根據書本， 我們很懂這兩個各別的系統， 但是一旦嘗試以數學模式來連結， 就完全行不通了。 百年來， 我們對於如何解決這基本的物理問題一籌莫展， 沒有可以支持的證據。"}, {"zh-tw": " And to little old me -- little, curious, skeptical James -- this was a supremely unsatisfying answer. So, I'm still a skeptical little kid.", "en": " 對於小老弟在下 -- 小小，好奇，不信服的詹姆斯 -- 這是絕對不可接受的。 今天的我，仍是個不易信服的小孩。"}, {"zh-tw": " Flash-forward nowto December of 2015, when I found myself smack in the middle of the physics worldbeing flipped on its head. It all started when we at CERNsaw something intriguing in our data: a hint of a new particle, an inkling of a possibly extraordinaryanswer to this question.", "en": " 時間快轉到 2015 年十二月， 我重拍額頭 突有個物理世界裡的靈光一閃。 始自我們在 CERN看到有趣的數據： 它們隱射一種新的粒子， 暗示一個可能不同凡響的解答。"}, {"zh-tw": " So I'm still a skepticallittle kid, I think, but I'm also now a particle hunter. I am a physicist at CERN'sLarge Hadron Collider, the largest scienceexperiment ever mounted.", "en": " 我仍是個不信服的小子， 現在也是個找尋粒子的人。 我是 CERN 的物理學家，用「大強子對撞機（LHC）」， 一具到目前為止所安裝過的最大型的科學實驗儀器。"}, {"zh-tw": " It's a 27-kilometer tunnelon the border of France and Switzerland buried 100 meters underground.

Now, higher energy is important because for particles,there is an equivalence between energy and particle mass, and mass is just a numberput there by nature.", "en": " 其設計和施工費時幾十年， 全球各地數以千計的物理學家通力合作， 在 2015 年夏天， 我們不眠不休地讓LHC 開始運轉， 實驗用到人類前所未有的最高撞擊能量。 高能量至關重要，對粒子而言， 能量和質量轉換守恆， 質量只是個自然界擺在那兒的數字。"}, {"zh-tw": " To discover new particles, we need to reach these bigger numbers. And to do that, we have to builda bigger, higher energy collider, and the biggest, highestenergy collider in the world is the Large Hadron Collider.", "en": " 為要發現新的粒子， 我們必須耗費更多的能量。 因此，我們必須建造更大、更耗能的對撞機； 而世界上最大的對撞機 是 LHC。"}, {"zh-tw": " And then, we collide protonsquadrillions of times, and we collect this data very slowly,over months and months. And then new particles might show upin our data as bumps -- slight deviations from what you expect, little clusters of data pointsthat make a smooth line not so smooth.", "en": " 然後，我們碰撞質子千萬億（10 的 24 方）次 我們經年累月慢慢地收集資料。 或許新的粒子會以突起的形狀呈現在資料的平滑線外 -- 稍微偏離預期值， 小小群集的數據點，使得平滑的線不再那麼地平滑。"}, {"zh-tw": " For example, this bump, after months of data-taking in 2012, led to the discoveryof the Higgs particle -- the Higgs boson -- and to a Nobel Prizefor the confirmation of its existence.

And the world ran with it anyway.", "en": " 我們試圖非常冷靜地看待它。 儘管如此，世界隨它起舞。"}, {"zh-tw": " The news loved it. People said it remindedthem of the little bump that was shown on the waytoward the Higgs boson discovery.", "en": " 新聞界喜愛它。 人們說它像是落在引導發現希格斯玻色子路上的那個小凸起。"}, {"zh-tw": " Better than that,my theorist colleagues -- I love my theorist colleagues -- my theorist colleagues wrote500 papers about this little bump. The world of particle physicshad been flipped on its head.", "en": " 更棒的是，我的理論派同事們 -- 我喜歡我的理論派同事們 -- 我的理論派同事們寫了五百篇關於這個小凸起的文章。 粒子物理學的世界已然翻轉。"}, {"zh-tw": " But what was it about this particular bump that caused thousands of physiciststo collectively lose their cool? This little bump was unique. This little bump indicated that we were seeing an unexpectedlylarge number of collisions whose debris consistedof only two photons, two particles of light.", "en": " 這個小凸起的什麼特點 使得成千上萬的物理學家熱血沸騰呢？ 這個小凸起獨一無二。 這個小凸起顯示 我們看到了意料之外的大量碰撞， 碰撞後只殘留兩個光子， 兩個光粒子。"}, {"zh-tw": " And that's rare. Particle collisions are notlike automobile collisions.", "en": " 這相當罕見。 粒子碰撞不像汽車碰撞。"}, {"zh-tw": " They have different rules. When two particles collideat almost the speed of light, the quantum world takes over.", "en": " 碰撞的規則不同。 當兩個粒子以接近光速的速度互撞， 行為就由量子世界的規則所掌控。"}, {"zh-tw": " And in the quantum world, these two particlescan briefly create a new particle that lives for a tiny fraction of a second before splitting into other particlesthat hit our detector. Imagine a car collisionwhere the two cars vanish upon impact, a bicycle appears in their place -- And then that bicycle explodesinto two skateboards, which hit our detector.", "en": " 在量子世界中， 這兩個粒子能短暫地創造一個新粒子， 只瞬間存在， 頃刻後分裂成其他粒子，並擊中我們的偵測器。 想像一下兩輛汽車互撞，汽車在相撞的當下消失， 原地出現了一輛自行車 -- 那輛自行車緊接著爆炸，變成兩個滑板， 撞到我們的偵測器。"}, {"zh-tw": " Hopefully, not literally. They're very expensive.", "en": " 當然不是字面上的撞上， 偵測器可是很貴的啊。"}, {"zh-tw": " Events where only two photonshit out detector are very rare. And because of the specialquantum properties of photons, there's a very small numberof possible new particles -- these mythical bicycles -- that can give birth to only two photons.", "en": " 僅僅兩個光子撞擊偵測器的事件非常地罕見。 由於光子具有量子的特性， 新粒子，也就是這些虛搆的自行車，出現的機率相當罕見， 只產生兩個光子的新粒子非常罕見。"}, {"zh-tw": " But one of these options is huge, and it has to do withthat long-standing question that bothered me as a tiny little kid, about gravity. Gravity may seem super strong to you, but it's actually crazily weakcompared to the other forces of nature.", "en": " 但是有一選項極可能發生， 和一個長期存在的未解題有關， 就是那個自幼就困擾我的重力問題。 或許你認為重力強而有力， 但是相較於自然界的其他力量，它其實超弱的。"}, {"zh-tw": " I can briefly beat gravity when I jump, but I can't pick a proton out of my hand. The strength of gravity comparedto the other forces of nature? It's 10 to the minus 39.", "en": " 當我跳起時，能夠短暫地擺脫重力， 但我卻無法用手撿起一粒質子。 相較於自然界的其他力量，重力的強度如何呢？ 是 10 的負 39 次方。"}, {"zh-tw": " That's a decimal with 39 zeros after it. Worse than that, all of the other known forces of natureare perfectly described by this thing we call the Standard Model, which is our current best descriptionof nature at its smallest scales, and quite frankly, one of the most successfulachievements of humankind -- except for gravity, which is absentfrom the Standard Model.", "en": " 小數點之後跟著 39 個零。 更糟的是， 所有其他已知的自然界力量都可被所謂的「標準模型」完美地描述。 那是我們目前描述自然界最小尺度的最佳模型。 坦白說， 那是人類最大的成就之一， 重力標準模型不存在是唯一的例外。"}, {"zh-tw": " It's crazy. It's almost as though mostof gravity has gone missing.", "en": " 難以置信。 彷彿大部分的重力消失不見了。"}, {"zh-tw": " We feel a little bit of it, but where's the rest of it? No one knows. But one theoretical explanationproposes a wild solution.", "en": " 我們察覺到少許重力， 但其他的部分呢？ 沒有人知道。 但有個理論提供了瘋狂的解釋。"}, {"zh-tw": " You and I -- even you in the back -- we live in three dimensions of space. I hope that's anon-controversial statement.", "en": " 你們和我 -- 包括坐在後面的諸位 -- 我們生活在三度空間裡。 希望這並無爭議。"}, {"zh-tw": " All of the known particles also livein three dimensions of space. In fact, a particle is just another name for an excitationin a three-dimensional field; a localized wobbling in space.", "en": " 所有已知的粒子也存在三度空間裡。 事實上，粒子只是別名， 是三度空間裡的波動； 空間中的局部晃動。"}, {"zh-tw": " More importantly, all the maththat we use to describe all this stuff assumes that there are onlythree dimensions of space. But math is math, and we can playaround with our math however we want.", "en": " 更重要的是，我們用來描述所有這些玩意的數學 全都假設只有三度空間。 但數學就是數學，我們可以隨意擺弄數學。"}, {"zh-tw": " And people have been playing aroundwith extra dimensions of space for a very long time, but it's always been an abstractmathematical concept. I mean, just look around you --you at the back, look around -- there's clearly onlythree dimensions of space.", "en": " 長久以來，人們一直悠遊於更多維度的數學中， 但僅僅是個抽象的數學概念而已。 我的意思是，看看你們的周圍 --坐在後面的諸位，請環顧四周 -- 顯然只有三度空間。"}, {"zh-tw": " But what if that's not true? What if the missing gravity is leakinginto an extra-spatial dimension that's invisible to you and I? What if gravity is just as strongas the other forces if you were to view it in thisextra-spatial dimension, and what you and I experienceis a tiny slice of gravity make it seem very weak? If this were true, we would have to expandour Standard Model of particles to include an extra particle,a hyperdimensional particle of gravity, a special graviton that livesin extra-spatial dimensions. I see the looks on your faces.", "en": " 但，倘若事實並非如此呢？ 如果消失的重力 流入了我們看不見的第四度空間呢？ 如果重力和其他的力量同樣有力， 前提是增加維度來看待它; 如果你我目前體驗到的重力只是一小部分， 所以才會看起來這麼弱呢？ 假如這是真的， 我們就必須擴大粒子的標準模型，包括其他的粒子， 「超維度的重力粒子」， 存在另一度空間的重力粒子。 我注意到你們的臉上的表情。"}, {"zh-tw": " You should be asking me the question, \"How in the world are we going to testthis crazy, science fiction idea, stuck as we are in three dimensions?\" The way we always do, by slamming together two protons -- Hard enough thatthe collision reverberates into any extra-spatial dimensionsthat might be there, momentarily creatingthis hyperdimensional graviton that then snaps backinto the three dimensions of the LHC and spits off two photons, two particles of light. And this hypothetical,extra-dimensional graviton is one of the only possible,hypothetical new particles that has the special quantum properties that could give birth to our little,two-photon bump.", "en": " 你們該問我： 「要怎樣去測試這瘋狂而科幻的想法呢？ 我們到底身處在三度空間裡啊！」 老法子， 使兩個光子互撞 -- 碰撞繞樑到或許存在的多度空間已經夠難了， 遑論頃刻間造出超維度的重力粒子， 並且撞擊到三度空間的 LHC， 又再分裂為兩個光子， 兩個光粒子。 這假設的超維度重力粒子， 唯一可能假設的新粒子， 具有特別的量子空間特性， 能產生我們這個小小的二光子凸起。"}, {"zh-tw": " So, the possibility of explainingthe mysteries of gravity and of discovering extradimensions of space -- perhaps now you get a sense as to why thousands of physics geekscollectively lost their cool over our little, two-photon bump. A discovery of this typewould rewrite the textbooks.", "en": " 因此，解釋重力的奧秘， 和發現另一度空間的可能性 -- 現在或許你們稍稍明白了 為何成千上萬的怪胎物理學家 會因小小的兩光子凸起而集體激動。 這樣的發現將會改寫教科書。"}, {"zh-tw": " But remember, the message from us experimentalists that actually were doingthis work at the time, was very clear: we need more data. With more data, the little bump will either turn intoa nice, crisp Nobel Prize -- Or the extra data will fill inthe space around the bump and turn it into a nice, smooth line.", "en": " 但請記住 我們這些當時真正做實驗的人的訊息非常的清楚： 我們需要更多的數據。 有了更多的數據， 這小小的凸起可能會成為漂亮、清新的諾貝爾獎 -- 或者增加的數據會填滿凸起周邊的空間， 使它成為平滑、順暢的線條。"}, {"zh-tw": " So we took more data, and with five times the data,several months later, our little bump turned into a smooth line. The news reported on a \"hugedisappointment,\" on \"faded hopes,\" and on particle physicists \"being sad.\" Given the tone of the coverage, you'd think that we had decidedto shut down the LHC and go home.", "en": " 因此我們收取更多的數據， 又經過幾個月，增加了五倍的數據， 我們的小凸起 成為平滑的線條。 新聞報導了「大失望」、「消逝的希望」， 以及粒子物理學家們很「悲傷」。 根據報導的語氣， 你們會認為我們已經決定關掉 LHC，打道回府了。"}, {"zh-tw": " But that's not what we did. But why not? I mean, if I didn't discovera particle -- and I didn't -- if I didn't discover a particle,why am I here talking to you? Why didn't I just hang my head in shame and go home? Particle physicists are explorers.", "en": " 但我們沒那樣做。 為什麼不呢？ 如果我沒發現新粒子 --而我的確沒發現 -- 如果我沒發現新粒子，怎麼還在這裡對你們演講？ 我怎麼沒羞恥地低著頭， 躲回家裡去呢？ 粒子物理學家是探索者。"}, {"zh-tw": " And very much of what we dois cartography. Let me put it this way: forgetabout the LHC for a second.", "en": " 我們繪製很多的圖。 暫時先不管 LHC，讓我這樣來描述："}, {"zh-tw": " Imagine you are a space explorerarriving at a distant planet, searching for aliens. What is your first task? To immediately orbit the planet,land, take a quick look around for any big, obvious signs of life, and report back to home base.", "en": " 想像你是個太空探險家， 飛到一個遙遠的行星去搜索外星人。 你的第一個任務是什麼？ 是立刻環繞行星、掃視地面， 快速地巡視四周， 看有沒有大的、顯著的生命跡象， 並回報基地。"}, {"zh-tw": " That's the stage we're at now. We took a first look at the LHC for any new, big,obvious-to-spot particles, and we can report that there are none.", "en": " 這正是我們眼前的階段。 我們先快巡 LHC， 看有沒有大的、顯著的粒子， 我們回報沒有。"}, {"zh-tw": " We saw a weird-looking alien bumpon a distant mountain, but once we got closer,we saw it was a rock. But then what do we do?Do we just give up and fly away? Absolutely not; we would be terrible scientists if we did.", "en": " 如同我們看到遠處有個像是外星人的怪異凸起， 一旦近看，發現只是個石頭。 接下來呢？我們放棄、飛離嗎？ 絕不； 若那樣做，我們就是差勁的科學家。"}, {"zh-tw": " No, we spend the next coupleof decades exploring, mapping out the territory, sifting through the sandwith a fine instrument, peeking under every stone, drilling under the surface. New particles can eithershow up immediately as big, obvious-to-spot bumps, or they can only reveal themselvesafter years of data taking.", "en": " 不，我們用接下來的幾十年去探索， 繪製地圖， 用精密儀器仔細地篩過沙土， 翻遍每塊石頭， 往地表下鑽。 新粒子可能以大而顯著的型態立即顯現， 或在收集許多數據後才會顯露出來。"}, {"zh-tw": " Humanity has just begun its explorationat the LHC at this big high energy, and we have much searching to do.
