We would never do that in our own countries.", "en": " 在西方世界中 我們不能理解怎麼有人能這麼做 這將會多麼限制言論自由啊 在我們國家 我們絕不這麼做"}, {"zh-tw": " But today in 2011, if you go and buy a color laser printer from any major laser printer manufacturer and print a page, that page will end up having slight yellow dots printed on every single page in a pattern which makes the page unique to you and to your printer. This is happening to us today.", "en": " 但來到現今2011年 如果你從任何一家大型雷射印表機製造商 買一部彩色雷射印表機 然後印出一張紙 這張紙最後 會有一些小黃點 印在每一頁上 圖案使這張紙是獨特的 對你和你的印表機都是 這就是現在 發生在我們身上的"}, {"zh-tw": " And nobody seems to be making a fuss about it.

Except they can if they hack into a foreign C.A.", "en": " 現在 我們所有人 或是大部份 使用Gmail 或是他對手們的其中一家 但這樣的服務 在極權主義國家更為盛行 像是伊朗 異議人士 會使用像Gmail 這樣的國外服務 因為他們知道 這些服務比起國內服務更可以信任 而且這些服務是由SSL加密連線 所以當地政府沒辦法竊聽 他們的討論 除非政府可以駭入國外的憑證發行機構"}, {"zh-tw": " and issue rogue certificates.

Well in Egypt, the rioters looted the headquarters of the Egyptian secret police in April 2011, and when they were looting the building they found lots of papers.

The company headquarters are right here.", "en": " 他們把這套工具 以28萬歐元賣給了埃及政府 這間公司的總部就在這"}, {"zh-tw": " So Western governments are providing totalitarian governments with tools to do this against their own citizens. But Western governments are doing it to themselves as well.", "en": " 所以 西方政府 提供工具給極權政府 來竊聽他們的人民 但西方政府對他們自己的人民也這麼做"}, {"zh-tw": " For example, in Germany, just a couple of weeks ago the so-called State Trojan was found, which was a trojan used by German government officials to investigate their own citizens.

They will tap your Internet connection.", "en": " 但在今日 不只是如此 他們還會監聽你的網路連線"}, {"zh-tw": " They will even use tools like State Trojan to infect your computer with a trojan, which enables them to watch all your communication, to listen to your online discussions, to collect your passwords. Now when we think deeper about things like these, the obvious response from people should be that, \"Okay, that sounds bad, but that doesn't really affect me because I'm a legal citizen.", "en": " 他們甚至使用使用像是 State Trojan 的工具 使你的電腦感染木馬 這使他們能夠 監看你所有的通訊 查看你線上的發言 並收集你的密碼 當我們對這樣的事情 做更深的思考 人們的反應顯然會是 \"嗯，這聽起來不好\" \"但我是個合法的公民，這並不影響我\""}, {"zh-tw": " Why should I worry? Because I have nothing to hide.\" And this is an argument, which doesn't make sense. Privacy is implied.", "en": " \"我何必擔心呢\" \"因為我沒什麼可隱藏的\" 但這是個不合理 的論點 隱私是不言而喻"}, {"zh-tw": " Privacy is not up for discussion. This is not a question between privacy against security.", "en": " 隱私用不著討論 這不是個 隱私對抗安全 的問題"}, {"zh-tw": " It's a question of freedom against control. And while we might trust our governments right now, right here in 2011, any right we give away will be given away for good.", "en": " 這是個 自由對抗控制 的問題 我們在2011年的當下 我們信任我們的政府 任何我們放棄的權利 會永久的失去"}, {"zh-tw": " And do we trust, do we blindly trust, any future government, a government we might have 50 years from now?
