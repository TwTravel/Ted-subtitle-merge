Celine is a housewife and lives in a rural district of Cameroon in west Central Africa.", "en": " 我想與你們分享 我的病人之一，席琳的故事 席琳是一個生活在農村地區的家庭主婦 中非西部的喀麥隆"}, {"zh-tw": " Six years ago, at the time of her HIV diagnosis, she was recruited to participate in the clinical trial which was running in her health district at the time. When I first met Celine, a little over a year ago, she had gone for 18 months without any antiretroviral therapy, and she was very ill.", "en": " 六年前，當時她被診斷出患有愛滋病毒 她就被吸收參加當時的健康區域 進行的臨床試驗 一年多以前，當我第一次見到席琳 她已經過了 18 個月 沒有任何的抗逆轉錄病毒治療的日子 而且她病得很厲害"}, {"zh-tw": " She told me that she stopped coming to the clinic when the trial ended because she had no money for the bus fare and was too ill to walk the 35-kilometer distance. Now during the clinical trial, she'd been given all her antiretroviral drugs free of charge, and her transportation costs had been covered by the research funds.", "en": " 她告訴我她已經不去診所了 當試驗結束的時候 因為她沒有錢買車票 而且太虛弱走不完 35 公里的路 因為在臨床試驗中 她可以免費得到抗逆轉錄病毒藥物 和交通費 這些都由研究經費支出"}, {"zh-tw": " All of these ended once the trial was completed, leaving Celine with no alternatives. She was unable to tell me the names of the drugs she'd received during the trial, or even what the trial had been about.", "en": " 但是只要這個試驗完成結束 席琳就別無選擇只好離開 她無法告訴我在治療期間 藥物的名稱 甚至這個試驗的相關資訊"}, {"zh-tw": " I didn't bother to ask her what the results of the trial were because it seemed obvious to me that she would have no clue. Yet what puzzled me most was Celine had given her informed consent to be a part of this trial, yet she clearly did not understand the implications of being a participant or what would happen to her once the trial had been completed.", "en": " 我根本毋需刻意去問她試驗的結果 很明顯地，她也沒有任何線索 但我最困惑的 是席琳簽署了一份知情同意書 作為試驗的一部分，但她顯然不明白 作為一個參與者的含義 或一旦試驗完成會產生什麼樣的結果"}, {"zh-tw": " Now, I have shared this story with you as an example of what can happen to participants in the clinical trial when it is poorly conducted. Maybe this particular trial yielded exciting results.", "en": " 現在，我分享這個故事給你們做個例子 有關在臨床試驗中進行得不順利的參與者 會發生什麼事 也許這個特別的試驗產生了令人振奮的成果"}, {"zh-tw": " Maybe it even got published in a high-profile scientific journal. Maybe it would inform clinicians around the world on how to improve on the clinical management of HIV patients.", "en": " 也許可以在高知名度的科學雜誌上發表 也許它告知了全世界的臨床醫生 如何提升對愛滋病毒患者的臨床管理"}, {"zh-tw": " But it would have done so at a price to hundreds of patients who, like Celine, were left to their own devices once the research had been completed. I do not stand here today to suggest in any way that conducting HIV clinical trials in developing countries is bad.", "en": " 但這樣做的代價 是數百名像席琳的患者, 讓他們自生自滅 一旦研究已經完成 我今天站在這裡，不是指出在 在發展中國家進行愛滋 臨床試驗是壞事"}, {"zh-tw": " On the contrary, clinical trials are extremely useful tools, and are much needed to address the burden of disease in developing countries. However, the inequalities that exist between richer countries and developing countries in terms of funding pose a real risk for exploitation, especially in the context of externally-funded research.", "en": " 相反地，臨床試驗在發展中國家 對於公諸大眾這疾病所造成的負擔,是有急迫需要 並且是極其有用的工具 但是，不平等的現象還是 存在於富裕國家和發展中國家，就資金而言 構成實際的開發風險 尤其是在外部資金研究的情況下"}, {"zh-tw": " Sadly enough, the fact remains that a lot of the studies that are conducted in developing countries could never be authorized in the richer countries which fund the research. I'm sure you must be asking yourselves what makes developing countries, especially those in sub-Saharan Africa, so attractive for these HIV clinical trials? Well, in order for a clinical trial to generate valid and widely applicable results, they need to be conducted with large numbers of study participants and preferably on a population with a high incidence of new HIV infections.", "en": " 令人遺憾的是，事實上仍然存在於 在發展中國家進行的很多研究 永遠不可能在較富裕的國家中得到批准 因為他們提供了研究的資金 我肯定你必須問自己 什麼使得發展中國家 特別是在撒哈拉以南的非洲地區 對於這些愛滋病毒臨床試驗有如此大的吸引力？ 嗯，在臨床試驗中，為了產生 有效和廣泛適用的結果 他們需要大量的參與者來進行研究 最好是在新愛滋病毒 感染發生率高的人口地區"}, {"zh-tw": " Sub-Saharan Africa largely fits this description, with 22 million people living with HIV, an estimated 70 percent of the 30 million people who are infected worldwide. Also, research within the continent is a lot easier to conduct due to widespread poverty, endemic diseases and inadequate health care systems.", "en": " 撒哈拉以南的非洲最符合這種條件 有 2千2百萬人感染了愛滋病毒 估計是全世界3千萬愛滋病感染者 的百分之七十 另外，在非洲大陸內 很容易在普遍貧窮、地方疾病 與衛生保健系統不足的地區進行研究"}, {"zh-tw": " A clinical trial that is considered to be potentially beneficial to the population is more likely to be authorized, and in the absence of good health care systems, almost any offer of medical assistance is accepted as better than nothing. Even more problematic reasons include lower risk of litigation, less rigorous ethical reviews, and populations that are willing to participate in almost any study that hints at a cure.", "en": " 一項被認為 對居民可能有利的臨床試驗 更容易在沒有良好 衛生保健系統下獲得認可 幾乎任何醫療援助提供都會 被接受，因為總比沒有好 即使當中有更多的問題,像是 為了降低訴訟風險 不嚴格的倫理道德審查 和願意參加的人員 幾乎在任何暗示得以治癒的研究中"}, {"zh-tw": " As funding for HIV research increases in developing countries and ethical review in richer countries become more strict, you can see why this context becomes very, very attractive. The high prevalence of HIV drives researchers to conduct research that is sometimes scientifically acceptable but on many levels ethically questionable.", "en": " 當愛滋病毒的研究經費 在發展中國家不斷增加 富有國家倫理審查變得更嚴格 您可以看到為什麼這事情變得 非常、非常有吸引力 愛滋病的高患病率趨使研究者 進行有時候是科學上可接受的研究 但其道德在多數層面上值得質疑"}, {"zh-tw": " How then can we ensure that, in our search for the cure, we do not take an unfair advantage of those who are already most affected by the pandemic? I invite you to consider four areas I think we can focus on in order to improve the way in which things are done. The first of these is informed consent.", "en": " 我們又如何確保，在我們尋求治癒的同時 我們沒有不當受益於那些 來自於已深受感染的病患 為了改善這些事情完成的方式 請你們考慮專心注意的四個領域 第一是知情同意書"}, {"zh-tw": " Now, in order for a clinical trial to be considered ethically acceptable, participants must be given the relevant information in a way in which they can understand, and must freely consent to participate in the trial. This is especially important in developing countries, where a lot of participants consent to research because they believe it is the only way in which they can receive medical care or other benefits.", "en": " 現在，為了臨床試驗可以 在道德上被接受 參與者必須被告知他們可以 理解的相關資訊 和必須自由同意參加試驗。 這在發展中國家尤其重要 很多參與研究者同意做研究 因為他們認為這是可以得到 醫療或其他福利的唯一途徑"}, {"zh-tw": " Consent procedures that are used in richer countries are often inappropriate or ineffective in a lot of developing countries. For example, it is counterintuitive to have an illiterate study participant, like Celine, sign a lengthy consent form that they are unable to read, let alone understand.", "en": " 富有國家中使用的同意流程 常常不適用於很多的發展中國家 或起不了作用 例如，這是違反常理的 研究參與者是文盲，像席琳 簽署冗長的知情同意書，而他們卻都無法閱讀 更不用說瞭解"}, {"zh-tw": " Local communities need to be more involved in establishing the criteria for recruiting participants in clinical trials, as well as the incentives for participation. The information in these trials needs to be given to the potential participants in linguistically and culturally acceptable formats.", "en": " 當地社區需要多人參與來 建立吸收臨床試驗參與者的標準 以及參與者的動機 這些試驗中的資訊 需要在口頭上告知且以文化上可接受的方式來通知 可能的參與者"}, {"zh-tw": " The second point I would like for you to consider is the standard of care that is provided to participants within any clinical trial. Now, this is subject to a lot of debate and controversy.", "en": " 第二點，我想請你們考慮 的是提供給任何臨床試驗參與者 的治療標準 現在，這很容易引起辯論和爭議"}, {"zh-tw": " Should the control group in the clinical trial be given the best current treatment which is available anywhere in the world? Or should they be given an alternative standard of care, such as the best current treatment available in the country in which the research is being conducted? Is it fair to evaluate a treatment regimen which may not be affordable or accessible to the study participants once the research has been completed? Now, in a situation where the best current treatment is inexpensive and simple to deliver, the answer is straightforward. However, the best current treatment available anywhere in the world is often very difficult to provide in developing countries.", "en": " 臨床試驗中的對照組 是否應該給予 全世界最好的治療？ 或者是，他們應當被給予一個替代標準的治療? 如正在進行研究中的國家可行的 當前最佳治療? 一旦研究完成 參與者可能不是都有機會得到治療 而來評估治療方案，這公平嗎? 現在，有一種當前最佳的治療 廉價而且容易提供 答案就很明確了 但是，這種全世界都有的 當前最佳治療，但就是 很難在發展中國家中提供"}, {"zh-tw": " It is important to assess the potential risks and benefits of the standard of care which is to be provided to participants in any clinical trial, and establish one which is relevant for the context of the study and most beneficial for the participants within the study. That brings us to the third point I want you think about: the ethical review of research.", "en": " 評估照顧標準的潛在風險和利益， 以提供給任何參加臨床試驗的參與者 並且建立一個與研究範圍內有關 並對在研究範圍內對參與者最有利的醫療照顧 是很重要的 接下來我要提出第三點 就是研究的倫理審查"}, {"zh-tw": " An effective system for reviewing the ethical suitability of clinical trials is primordial to safeguard participants within any clinical trial. Unfortunately, this is often lacking or inefficient in a lot of developing countries.", "en": " 臨床試驗的審查道德適用性的有效制度 對保障任何臨床試驗參與者而言 是最根本的 不幸的，這通常在發展中國家 非常欠缺或是效率很低"}, {"zh-tw": " Local governments need to set up effective systems for reviewing the ethical issues around the clinical trials which are authorized in different developing countries, and they need to do this by setting up ethical review committees that are independent of the government and research sponsors. Public accountability needs to be promoted through transparency and independent review by nongovernmental and international organizations as appropriate.", "en": " 地方政府需要建立有效的系統 以審查臨床試驗的倫理議題 系統在不同的發展中國家授權 而且他們需要建立一個非政府 與研究贊助者的 道德審查委員會 公共受托責任需要經由透明 和獨立的審查 的非政府和國際組織來推動 較為適當"}, {"zh-tw": " The final point I would like for you to consider tonight is what happens to participants in the clinical trial once the research has been completed. I think it is absolutely wrong for research to begin in the first place without a clear plan for what would happen to the participants once the trial has ended.", "en": " 最後一點，我想請你們今晚考慮一下的就是 一旦研究已經完成 臨床試驗中的參加者會發生什麼情況 我認為一開始就沒有明確的計畫 這個研究是絕對錯誤的 因為也不知道一旦臨床試驗結束 參與試驗者會發生什麼事"}, {"zh-tw": " Now, researchers need to make every effort to ensure that an intervention that has been shown to be beneficial during a clinical trial is accessible to the participants of the trial once the trial has been completed. In addition, they should be able to consider the possibility of introducing and maintaining effective treatments in the wider community once the trial ends.", "en": " 現在，研究人員需要盡一切努力來確保 已被證明在臨床試驗期間 的介入是有益的 就是一旦試驗完成 參與者的狀況是可以被追蹤的到。 此外，他們應能夠考慮 引進和維護有效治療方法的可能性 在更廣泛的社會中，一旦試驗結束。"}, {"zh-tw": " If, for any reason, they feel that this might not be possible, then I think they should have to ethically justify why the clinical trial should be conducted in the first place. Now, fortunately for Celine, our meeting did not end in my office.", "en": " 如果出於任何原因，他們覺得這是不可能的 那麼，我認為他們應該在道德上證明 臨床試驗的進行為什麼應該被放在第一位是正當的。 現在，幸運的是對於席琳， 我們的見面並未在我的辦公室結束。"}, {"zh-tw": " I was able to get her enrolled into a free HIV treatment program closer to her home, and with a support group to help her cope. Her story has a positive ending, but there are thousands of others in similar situations who are much less fortunate.", "en": " 我能讓她登記免費的愛滋病毒治療方案 離她家很近 還有支援小組來幫她應付。 她的故事有一個正面的結局， 但還有數以千計的人在類似情況下 沒這麼幸運。"}, {"zh-tw": " Although she may not know this, my encounter with Celine has completely changed the way in which I view HIV clinical trials in developing countries, and made me even more determined to be part of the movement to change the way in which things are done. I believe that every single person listening to me tonight can be part of that change.", "en": " 雖然她可能不知道這一點， 我和席琳的相遇完全改變了 我對發展中國家愛滋病毒臨床試驗的看法 並讓我更確定成為活動的一份子 去改變目前既定的事實與作法。 我相信，每一個人 今晚聽過我的談話就可以成為這種改變的一份子。"}, {"zh-tw": " If you are a researcher, I hold you to a higher standard of moral conscience, to remain ethical in your research, and not compromise human welfare in your search for answers. If you work for a funding agency or pharmaceutical company, I challenge you to hold your employers to fund research that is ethically sound.", "en": " 如果你是一位研究人員，我會對你 寄望更高的道德良知標準， 在你的研究中保持著倫理 而非在你尋求的答案中與人類福利妥協。 如果你為資助機構或製藥公司工作， 我對你會認為你的雇主 資助研究是合乎倫理道德的感到質疑。"}, {"zh-tw": " If you come from a developing country like myself, I urge you to hold your government to a more thorough review of the clinical trials which are authorized in your country. Yes, there is a need for us to find a cure for HIV, to find an effective vaccine for malaria, to find a diagnostic tool that works for T.B., but I believe that we owe it to those who willingly and selflessly consent to participate in these clinical trials to do this in a humane way.", "en": " 如果你像我一樣，來自發展中國家 我力勸您要求您的政府 對臨床試驗進行更徹底的審查 這在你的國家是允許的 是的，我們需要找到治療愛滋病毒的方法 和治療瘧疾的有效疫苗 為結核病尋找診斷工具 但我相信我們應把它歸功於那些心甘情願地 和無私地同意參加這些臨床試驗的人 以人道的方式來進行"}, {"zh-tw": " Thank you.", "en": " 謝謝。"}], "title": "Boghuma Kabisen Titanji Ethical Riddles In Hiv Research"}
