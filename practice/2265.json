From a few bones, we inferthe existence of dinosuars.", "en": " 一個人可從微不足道的事得出了偉大的猜想。」 馬克．吐溫當然只是開玩笑，但他是對的。 科學有其有趣之處。 從幾塊骨頭，我們推測了恐龍的存在;"}, {"zh-tw": " From spectral lines,the composition of nebulae.

Because, it turns out thatthe fascinating thing about science is also a fascinatingthing about children, which, to put a gentlerspin on Mark Twain, is precisely their abilityto draw rich, abstract inferences rapidly and accuratelyfrom sparse, noisy data.", "en": " 我在麻省理工大腦及認知科學系實驗室中， 花了過去十年研究一個謎團， 就是兒童如何從零開始，快速地學到那麼多的東西。 科學令人著迷之處， 亦正是孩子令人著迷的地方。 回應馬克．吐溫的話， 那就是孩子從零碎和離亂的訊息中，能夠得出豐富而抽象的推論的能力。"}, {"zh-tw": " I'm going to give youjust two examples today. One is about a problem of generalization, and the other is about a problemof causal reasoning.", "en": " 我將舉出兩個例子: 一個是關於廣義化的問題， 另一個則是關於因果推理的。"}, {"zh-tw": " And although I'm going to talkabout work in my lab, this work is inspired byand indebted to a field. I'm grateful to mentors, colleagues,and collaborators around the world.", "en": " 雖然我將會談及我實驗室的研究， 但這個研究的靈感是來自一個領域， 一個我要感謝世界各地的導師、同事和工作夥伴付出的領域。"}, {"zh-tw": " Let me start with the problemof generalization. Generalizing from small samples of datais the bread and butter of science.", "en": " 讓我先談談廣義化的問題。 歸納數據樣本在科學上是不可或缺的，"}, {"zh-tw": " We poll a tiny fraction of the electorate and we predict the outcomeof national elections.

Well, babies have to generalizefrom small samples of data all the time. They see a few rubber ducksand learn that they float, or a few balls and learn that they bounce.", "en": " 因此科學家著緊抽樣的方法是否隨機。 但這又跟嬰兒有甚麼關係? 嬰兒在任何時候都要歸納數據樣本， 當他們看到幾隻橡皮鴨，並知道它們浮在水面。 又或見到幾個皮球，並知道它們能彈跳。"}, {"zh-tw": " And they develop expectationsabout ducks and balls that they're going to extendto rubber ducks and balls for the rest of their lives.

Let's find out. I'm going to show you two movies, one from each of two conditionsof an experiment, and because you're going to seejust two movies, you're going to see just two babies, and any two babies differ from each otherin innumerable ways.", "en": " 因此嬰兒留意這些細節能否代表整體。 我們一起看看吧。 我將讓你看兩段短片， 這兩段短片分別代表實驗的兩個情況。 由於你將看到兩段短片， 你只會看到兩個嬰兒， 而這兩個嬰兒在很多地方都是不同的。"}, {"zh-tw": " But these babies, of course,here stand in for groups of babies, and the differences you're going to see represent average group differencesin babies' behavior across conditions.

We're going to show babiesa box of blue and yellow balls, and my then-graduate student,now colleague at Stanford, Hyowon Gweon, is going to pull three blue ballsin a row out of this box, and when she pulls those balls out,she's going to squeeze them, and the balls are going to squeak.", "en": " 但對我來說他們的神奇之處， 也是我想你們留意的地方， 就是這兩種情況之間的分別。 因為這兩段短片唯一不同的地方， 正是嬰兒將要觀察的資料。 我們把一些藍色和黃色的球給嬰兒看。 權孝媛當時是我的學生，現在則是史丹佛大學的同事。 她將拿出三個藍色的球， 而當她拿出這些球時，她會把球擠一下， 讓這些球發出吱吱聲。"}, {"zh-tw": " And if you're a baby,that's like a TED Talk. It doesn't get better than that.", "en": " 這對於嬰兒來說就像TED一樣， 是件很美好的事。"}, {"zh-tw": " But the important point is it's reallyeasy to pull three blue balls in a row out of a box of mostly blue balls.

You [probably won't] randomly drawthree blue balls in a row out of a box of mostly yellow balls.", "en": " 有趣的地方是當把一樣的東西給嬰兒看時，甚麼事會發生。 我們能肯定這是完全一樣的，因我們有個秘密的空間， 從中我們抽出這些球。 但這次我們改變了抽樣的母體。 這次我們在一個裝滿黃色球的箱中，抽出三個藍色球給嬰兒看。 想想甚麼事會發生? 你大概不能隨機地在裝滿黃色球的箱中，連續抽出三個藍色球，"}, {"zh-tw": " That is not plausiblyrandomly sampled evidence. That evidence suggests that maybe Hyowonwas deliberately sampling the blue balls.", "en": " 因此這很可能不是隨機抽樣。 這反映了孝媛可能是刻意抽出藍色球，"}, {"zh-tw": " Maybe there's something specialabout the blue balls. Maybe only the blue balls squeak.", "en": " 可能這些藍色球是特別的， 可能只有藍色球能吱吱叫。"}, {"zh-tw": " Let's see what the baby does. (Video) HG: See this?(Ball squeaks) See this toy?(Ball squeaks) Oh, that was cool.

And this leads to a fun prediction: Suppose you pulled just one blue ballout of the mostly yellow box.", "en": " 垂直軸代表在每一個情況中，有多少百分比的嬰兒擠壓球。 你可看見嬰兒在樣本和整體一致時， 比刻意挑選的樣本， 較會歸納他們看到的特徵。 因此這帶出一個有趣的預測。 假設你在一個裝滿黃色球的箱中只拿出一個藍色球，"}, {"zh-tw": " You [probably won't] pull three blue ballsin a row at random out of a yellow box, but you could randomly samplejust one blue ball. That's not an improbable sample.", "en": " 當然你很難隨機地連續抽出三個藍色球， 但你可以只用一個藍色球作樣本， 這不一定是個不可行的樣本。"}, {"zh-tw": " And if you could reach intoa box at random and pull out something that squeaks,maybe everything in the box squeaks. So even though babies are going to seemuch less evidence for squeaking, and have many fewer actions to imitate in this one ball condition than inthe condition you just saw, we predicted that babies themselveswould squeeze more, and that's exactly what we found.", "en": " 當你隨機抽出一個會吱吱叫的東西時， 可能箱中所有的東西都會吱吱叫， 因此雖然嬰兒會看到較少吱吱叫的例子， 而且在只抽出一個球的情況下，他們會有較少的動作去模仿， 但我們預計會有更多嬰兒擠壓球。 這正是我們發現的結果。"}, {"zh-tw": " So 15-month-old babies,in this respect, like scientists, care whether evidenceis randomly sampled or not, and they use this to developexpectations about the world: what squeaks and what doesn't, what to explore and what to ignore. Let me show you another example now, this time about a problemof causal reasoning.", "en": " 因此15月大的嬰兒在這方面就像科學家， 他們留意抽樣的方法是否隨機， 並以此建立對事物的概念: 甚麼會吱吱叫而甚麼不會， 甚麼需要探索而甚麼可忽略。 現在讓我給你們看看另一個例子， 這次是關於因果推理的。"}, {"zh-tw": " And it starts with a problemof confounded evidence that all of us have, which is that we are part of the world.

I'll show you a few-second clip.", "en": " 他想開動這個玩具，但他做不到。 我會讓你看一段幾秒的影片。"}, {"zh-tw": " And there's two possibilities, broadly: Maybe he's doing something wrong, or maybe there's somethingwrong with the toy.

Hyowon is going to try to makethe toy go and succeed.", "en": " 這個實驗是這樣的: 孝媛嘗試開動那個玩具並成功了，"}, {"zh-tw": " I am then going to try twiceand fail both times, and then Hyowon is goingto try again and succeed, and this roughly sums up my relationshipto my graduate students in technology across the board.

If you've been following my world,the field of brain and cognitive sciences, for the past few years, three big ideas will have cometo your attention.", "en": " 我會提出兩個重點作總結。 如果你近年有留意大腦和認知科學領域， 你會聽到三個重要的概念。"}, {"zh-tw": " The first is that this isthe era of the brain.

I think these are all important stories, and they have a lot to tell usabout what it means to be human, but I want you to note that todayI told you a very different story.", "en": " 最後一個你會聽過的重要概念是， 我們將對大腦有很深入的認識，並能掌握大數據，而這很可能是件好事。 因為相比機器而言， 人類易犯錯誤，我們會走捷徑， 我們會做錯， 我們在很多方面都有偏見， 我們會有錯誤的理解。 我認為這都是重要的， 因為這反映了人類的特質， 但我今天想帶出事情的另一面。"}, {"zh-tw": " It's a story about minds and not brains, and in particular, it's a storyabout the kinds of computations that uniquely human minds can perform, which involve rich, structured knowledgeand the ability to learn from small amounts of data,the evidence of just a few examples.

Human minds thinkof altogether new ideas.", "en": " 大家，人腦不只是懂得從少量的數據中學習。 人腦能想到新的主意。"}, {"zh-tw": " Human minds generateresearch and discovery, and human minds generateart and literature and poetry and theater, and human minds take care of other humans: our old, our young, our sick.
