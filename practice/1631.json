After all, if it is being done somewhere by someone, and we can participate virtually, then why bother leaving the house?\" I'm usually introduced as a polar explorer. I'm not sure that's the most progressive or 21st-century of job titles, but I've spent more than two percent now of my entire life living in a tent inside the Arctic Circle, so I get out of the house a fair bit.", "en": " 基本上我拉雪橇為生 所以不需太費心就可以考倒我 但我還是要念出 今年早些時後的訪談問題 「從哲學角度看，源源不絕的資訊 會不會偷走我們想像的能力 或者取代實現夢想的意願？ 畢竟，如果有人已完成對某處的探險 而且我們能虛擬參與 那何必還要離家探險？」 通常人們介紹我是極地探險家 我不知道這算不算是最先進、最符合21世紀的 工作職稱，但我的確已花了超過 百分之二的人生住在北極圈的帳篷裡 也就是說我常常離家探險"}, {"zh-tw": " And in my nature, I guess, I am a doer of things more than I am a spectator or a contemplator of things, and it's that dichotomy, the gulf between ideas and action that I'm going to try and explore briefly. The pithiest answer to the question \"why?\" that's been dogging me for the last 12 years was credited certainly to this chap, the rakish-looking gentleman standing at the back, second from the left, George Lee Mallory. Many of you will know his name.", "en": " 而我猜我的本性是比較偏向做事的人 而不是一個旁觀者或是沈思者 我想要簡單試著解釋、探索的 就是這個把想法與行動分開的隔閡這個二分法 過去12年，「為什麼要離家探險」這個問題 一直不斷困擾著我而我能得到的最精闢解答 絕對要歸功於這個傢伙這個看起來流裡流氣的紳士 站在後排左數第二的那位 喬治·馬洛里（George Mallory）各位馬上就會知道他是誰"}, {"zh-tw": " In 1924 he was last seen disappearing into the clouds near the summit of Mt. Everest. He may or may not have been the first person to climb Everest, more than 30 years before Edmund Hillary.", "en": " 1924年他最後被人目睹消失在 靠近聖母峰（珠穆朗瑪峰）峰頂的雲裡 很難說他是不是第一個登上聖母峰的人 比愛德蒙·希拉瑞（史上記錄第一人）攻頂還早30年"}, {"zh-tw": " No one knows if he got to the top. It's still a mystery. But he was credited with coining the phrase, \"Because it's there.\" Now I'm not actually sure that he did say that.", "en": " 沒有人知道他是否登上山頂。這仍是個謎 但他的確是說出「因為山就在那裡」這句名言的人 我現在也不確定他是否真的說了那句話"}, {"zh-tw": " There's very little evidence to suggest it, but what he did say is actually far nicer, and again, I've printed this. I'm going to read it out. \"The first question which you will ask and which I must try to answer is this: What is the use of climbing Mt. Everest? And my answer must at once be, it is no use.", "en": " 幾乎沒有什麼證據能證明，但他確實說過的話 比那句其實還更好 所以又來了，我把它印下來了，所以我要把它念出來 「你會問的第一個問題 而我一定要試著回答的，是這個： 登上聖母峰有什麼好處？ 而我當下的回答則是，沒有任何好處"}, {"zh-tw": " There is not the slightest prospect of any gain whatsoever. Oh, we may learn a little about the behavior of the human body at high altitudes, and possibly medical men may turn our observation to some account for the purposes of aviation, but otherwise nothing will come of it.", "en": " 這件事沒有任何一點得到好處的展望 噢，我們可能會對人體在那樣的高度 有什麼反應多一點點瞭解 也有可能醫療人員會把我們的觀察 轉成對航空有實際價值的東西 但在其他方面一點用處也沒有"}, {"zh-tw": " We shall not bring back a single bit of gold or silver, and not a gem, nor any coal or iron.

The furthest I've ever got away from my front door was in the spring of 2004. I still don't know exactly what came over me, but my plan was to make a solo and unsupported crossing of the Arctic Ocean.", "en": " 那是生命的意義，也是生命的目的。」 馬洛里對離家探險的論點是 從事這些偉大的冒險既喜悅又有趣 但是，這並不完全符合我自己的經驗 我離家到過最遠的地方 發生在2004年春天。我仍然不明瞭 是什麼原因讓我這麼做，但我的計劃是要 獨自且不受支援地跨越北冰洋"}, {"zh-tw": " I planned essentially to walk from the north coast of Russia to the North Pole, and then to carry on to the north coast of Canada. No one had ever done this. I was 26 at the time.", "en": " 基本上我計劃要徒步從俄羅斯的北海岸 走到北極，然後繼續往加拿大北海岸過去 從來沒人做過這個。我那時26歲"}, {"zh-tw": " A lot of experts were saying it was impossible, and my mum certainly wasn't very keen on the idea. The journey from a small weather station on the north coast of Siberia up to my final starting point, the edge of the pack ice, the coast of the Arctic Ocean, took about five hours, and if anyone watched fearless Felix Baumgartner going up, rather than just coming down, you'll appreciate the sense of apprehension, as I sat in a helicopter thundering north, and the sense, I think if anything, of impending doom.", "en": " 許多專家都說這是不可能的 我媽媽當然對這個想法一點也不熱衷 這段從西伯利亞北海岸小氣象站 到我最後的出發點的旅程 也就是浮冰的邊緣，北冰洋的海岸 花了我大約五小時。如果有人看過不怕死的 菲利克斯·保加拿（高空跳傘專家）向高空飛升而不是向下跳 你就能領悟當我坐在直升機上，向北呼嘯而去時 那種憂慮的感覺 如果我還能想出什麼好形容，那就是末日臨頭的感覺"}, {"zh-tw": " I sat there wondering what on Earth I had gotten myself into. There was a bit of fun, a bit of joy.", "en": " 我坐在那想著，我到底在搞什麼 的確是有一點好玩，是有一點快樂"}, {"zh-tw": " I was 26. I remember sitting there looking down at my sledge. I had my skis ready to go, I had a satellite phone, a pump-action shotgun in case I was attacked by a polar bear. I remember looking out of the window and seeing the second helicopter.", "en": " 我26歲。我記得我坐在那裡 低頭看著我的雪橇。我已經準備好了滑雪板 我有一只衛星電話，一把滑桿式散彈槍 以防萬一我被北極熊攻擊 我還記得從窗戶往外看著第二架直升機"}, {"zh-tw": " We were both thundering through this incredible Siberian dawn, and part of me felt a bit like a cross between Jason Bourne and Wilfred Thesiger. Part of me felt quite proud of myself, but mostly I was just utterly terrified.

We took this photo next to the helicopter. Beyond that, I didn't see anyone for 10 weeks.", "en": " 之間我沒有看過任何人。我們在直升機旁照了這張相片 除此之外，這10週我沒看到任何人"}, {"zh-tw": " The North Pole is slap bang in the middle of the sea, so I'm traveling over the frozen surface of the Arctic Ocean. NASA described conditions that year as the worst since records began.", "en": " 北極就坐落在海洋中間 所以我走在表層冰凍的北冰洋上 美國國家航空暨太空總署形容那年的天候是有史以來最糟"}, {"zh-tw": " I was dragging 180 kilos of food and fuel and supplies, about 400 pounds. The average temperature for the 10 weeks was minus 35. Minus 50 was the coldest. So again, there wasn't an awful lot of joy or fun to be had.", "en": " 我拖著180公斤的食物、燃油及補給品 大約是400磅。那十週的平均溫度 是零下35度，最冷的時候是零下50度 所以再說一次，這真的沒甚麼喜悅，也不怎麼好玩"}, {"zh-tw": " One of the magical things about this journey, however, is that because I'm walking over the sea, over this floating, drifting, shifting crust of ice that's floating on top of the Arctic Ocean is it's an environment that's in a constant state of flux. The ice is always moving, breaking up, drifting around, refreezing, so the scenery that I saw for nearly 3 months was unique to me. No one else will ever, could ever, possibly see the views, the vistas, that I saw for 10 weeks.", "en": " 但在這旅程中最令人驚奇的 就是因為我是走在海上 走在漂搖不定、處處移動的大冰塊上 漂浮在北冰洋面上的冰 是不穩定狀態的環境 冰塊永遠在移動、破裂、四處漂流 再結凍，所以我在這近3個月所看到的景象 對我是非常特別的。再沒有人 能有機會看到我在這10週內看到的風景、景色"}, {"zh-tw": " And that, I guess, is probably the finest argument for leaving the house. I can try to tell you what it was like, but you'll never know what it was like, and the more I try to explain that I felt lonely, I was the only human being in 5.4 million square-miles, it was cold, nearly minus 75 with windchill on a bad day, the more words fall short, and I'm unable to do it justice.", "en": " 而我猜這可能是離家探險最有力的論點 我可以試著描述它像什麼 但你永遠不會真正明白那到底是什麼樣子 而且我愈試著解釋當時的孤獨 540萬平方英哩只有我一個人 真的好冷，很慘的日子裡風寒指數是零下75度 就愈發現再多的言語也不能形容，而我也不知道該如何說的明白"}, {"zh-tw": " And it seems to me, therefore, that the doing, you know, to try to experience, to engage, to endeavor, rather than to watch and to wonder, that's where the real meat of life is to be found, the juice that we can suck out of our hours and days. And I would add a cautionary note here, however.", "en": " 因此我是這樣看的，身體力行 你知道的，去試著體驗、參與冒險 而不只是旁觀及猜想，才是 找到生命的重點的方法 從漫漫人生中榨出的精華 不過我還是要在這裡加上幾點注意事項"}, {"zh-tw": " In my experience, there is something addictive about tasting life at the very edge of what's humanly possible. Now I don't just mean in the field of daft macho Edwardian style derring-do, but also in the fields of pancreatic cancer, there is something addictive about this, and in my case, I think polar expeditions are perhaps not that far removed from having a crack habit.", "en": " 依我的經驗，去嘗試人力所能及的極限 存在着一些非常容易上癮的東西 我不單指那種愛德華時代風 充滿男子氣概又有點蠢的非凡大冒險 同時也指像是得了胰腺癌那樣 這裡面的確有些東西會使人上癮，以我為例 我認為極地探險跟毒癮 也相差不遠"}, {"zh-tw": " I can't explain quite how good it is until you've tried it, but it has the capacity to burn up all the money I can get my hands on, to ruin every relationship I've ever had, so be careful what you wish for. Mallory postulated that there is something in man that responds to the challenge of the mountain, and I wonder if that's the case whether there's something in the challenge itself, in the endeavor, and particularly in the big, unfinished, chunky challenges that face humanity that call out to us, and in my experience that's certainly the case.", "en": " 我無法解釋這有多美好，直到你親自嘗試 而它也有辦法燒掉你手上所有的錢 破壞你所有的人際關係 所以許願要小心 馬洛里認為在人的內心 有些東西會回應山峰發出的挑戰 而我不知道是否真的有東西在 挑戰本身裡、在冒險裡呼喚著我們，特別是在那些 很大、尚未完成、非常困難，迫使我們面對人性的挑戰裡。 而以我的經驗那的確是如此"}, {"zh-tw": " There is one unfinished challenge that's been calling out to me for most of my adult life. Many of you will know the story.", "en": " 我有一件尚未完成的挑戰 在我大部份的成人歲月裡呼喚著我 在座各位很快會知道這個故事"}, {"zh-tw": " This is a photo of Captain Scott and his team. Scott set out just over a hundred years ago to try to become the first person to reach the South Pole.", "en": " 這是英國極地探險家斯科特隊長及其隊員的照片 斯科特在一百多年前出發，嘗試 要成為第一個抵達南極的人"}, {"zh-tw": " No one knew what was there. It was utterly unmapped at the time. We knew more about the surface of the moon than we did about the heart of Antarctica. Scott, as many of you will know, was beaten to it by Roald Amundsen and his Norwegian team, who used dogs and dogsleds. Scott's team were on foot, all five of them wearing harnesses and dragging around sledges, and they arrived at the pole to find the Norwegian flag already there, I'd imagine pretty bitter and demoralized.", "en": " 沒有人知道那裡有什麼。那時地圖上完全 沒有這個點。我們對月球表面的瞭解 多過我們對南極洲的瞭解 很多人都知道，斯科特其實是被 挪威人羅爾德·亞孟及其團隊打敗 亞孟一行人使用雪橇犬及狗用雪橇斯科特的團隊採用步行 這五人隊伍全副武裝以人力拉雪橇 當他們到達南極時，發現挪威旗已經插在那兒 我可以想像那種苦澀與沮喪"}, {"zh-tw": " All five of them turned and started walking back to the coast and all five died on that return journey. There is a sort of misconception nowadays that it's all been done in the fields of exploration and adventure.", "en": " 這五人團隊於是回頭開始走回海岸營地 而這五人在回程中全部喪生 現今人們有種誤解，就是 在探索及冒險這個領域，該做的都做完了"}, {"zh-tw": " When I talk about Antarctica, people often say, \"Hasn't, you know, that's interesting, hasn't that Blue Peter presenter just done it on a bike?\" Or, \"That's nice. You know, my grandmother's going on a cruise to Antarctica next year. You know. Is there a chance you'll see her there?\" But Scott's journey remains unfinished.", "en": " 當我講起南極洲，大家都說 「你知道，是很有趣，但是 那個藍色彼得（英國兒童節目）主持人不是已經騎單車完成了嗎？」 或說「很好，很好，你知道我祖母明年 要搭郵輪去南極，你知道的。 你有機會在那邊見見她嗎？」 但斯科特的旅程依然未完成"}, {"zh-tw": " No one has ever walked from the very coast of Antarctica to the South Pole and back again. It is, arguably, the most audacious endeavor of that Edwardian golden age of exploration, and it seemed to me high time, given everything we have figured out in the century since from scurvy to solar panels, that it was high time someone had a go at finishing the job.", "en": " 沒有人真正全程走完從南極洲海岸 到南極再返回的路程 這真可說是，最具愛德華時代 探險金色年華風格的大膽奮進冒險 對我而言這也是最佳時期，想想 在過去這個世紀我們已經搞懂的一切 從壞血病治療到太陽能板。的確時機已經成熟 該是有人去完成這項工作的時候"}, {"zh-tw": " So that's precisely what I'm setting out to do. This time next year, in October, I'm leading a team of three.", "en": " 所以這就是我要出發去做的事 明年這個時候，十月份，我要帶一個三人團隊"}, {"zh-tw": " It will take us about four months to make this return journey. That's the scale. The red line is obviously halfway to the pole.", "en": " 我們這會花大約四個月的時間來完成這項旅程 那是探險圖。紅色線很明顯就是到南極的半程"}, {"zh-tw": " We have to turn around and come back again. I'm well aware of the irony of telling you that we will be blogging and tweeting. You'll be able to live vicariously and virtually through this journey in a way that no one has ever before.", "en": " 我們到達後必須回轉再返回出發地 我很瞭解，說我們會寫部落格及推文 聽起來非常諷刺。你們可以 用前所未有的方式間接、虛擬 參與這次冒險旅程"}, {"zh-tw": " And it'll also be a four-month chance for me to finally come up with a pithy answer to the question, \"Why?\" And our lives today are safer and more comfortable than they have ever been. There certainly isn't much call for explorers nowadays. My career advisor at school never mentioned it as an option. If I wanted to know, for example, how many stars were in the Milky Way, how old those giant heads on Easter Island were, most of you could find that out right now without even standing up.", "en": " 這也給我四個月的機會，能敲定 一個精闢的答案來回答那個「為什麼」 我們今日的生活比起以前 更安全更舒適。已經沒有太多地方 呼喚我們去探險了。我學校裡的職業顧問 從來也沒提過這個選擇 假使我想知道，舉個例子 在銀河裡有多少星星 復活節島上的巨石像有多古老 在座的多數可以現在就找到答案 甚至不用站起來"}, {"zh-tw": " And yet, if I've learned anything in nearly 12 years now of dragging heavy things around cold places, it is that true, real inspiration and growth only comes from adversity and from challenge, from stepping away from what's comfortable and familiar and stepping out into the unknown. In life, we all have tempests to ride and poles to walk to, and I think metaphorically speaking, at least, we could all benefit from getting outside the house a little more often, if only we could summon up the courage.", "en": " 但是，如果說我在過去12年裡 從在寒冷的地方拉重物學到了什麼 那就是又真又活的啟示及成長 只能從逆境及挑戰中獲得 要離開自己舒適又熟悉的空間 進入未知的領域才能獲得 我們的生命裡都有必須克服的風暴及要到達的目標 而我想，象徵性地說，至少 我們大家都能從多一點的離家冒險得到好處 只要我們能鼓起一點勇氣"}, {"zh-tw": " I certainly would implore you to open the door just a little bit and take a look at what's outside.
