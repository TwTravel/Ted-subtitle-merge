Here it is, it's about bicycle accidents.\" Two days it took the Times Online to make a map, a mashable map -- we call these things mash-ups -- a mashed-up user interface that allows you to go in there and have a look and find out whether your bicycle route to work was affected. Here's more data, traffic survey data, again, put out by the U.K. government, and because they put it up using the Linked Data standards, then a user could just make a map, just by clicking.", "en": " 經典的故事， 也是很多人首選的故事 是當3月10日， 事實上TED剛剛結束不久 英國政府的Paul Clarke 在博客中說： “啊， 我才找到一些數據 是關於自行車事故的數據。 ” 時代在線用了兩天時間 做了一個地圖， 一個合成的地圖 我們稱之為：合成(把數據融合到地圖上) 經過這種合成，你可以通過用戶界面 搜索和找到你的上班的自行車 路線是否受影響 除此， 網上還很多其他的數據， 交通調查數據等 都是英國政府放上去的 因為他們上傳的數據符合鏈接標準 所以用戶可以使用這些數據做地圖 只要點擊一下就做成了"}, {"zh-tw": " Does this data affect things?
