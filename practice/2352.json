A memo from the Counterterrorism Unitcited McGowan's \"anti-government beliefs.\" While imprisoned, he continued writingabout environmental issues, saying that activists mustreflect on their mistakes and listen to each other.", "en": " 後來我發現到麥加文真正被送到 CMU 不是因為他做過什麼， 卻是他說話的內容； 出自反恐單位的備忘錄引述了麥加文的反政府信念， 在坐牢期間他繼續著述環境議題， 說活動人士必須認真思考他們的錯誤， 以及聽別人怎麼講。"}, {"zh-tw": " Now, in fairness, if you've spentany time at all in Washington, DC, you know this is really a radicalconcept for the government. I actually asked to visitMcGowan in the CMU.", "en": " 持平來說如果你曾經待過華盛頓特區任何一些時間， 你就知道對政府而言這真的是激進的想法啊！ 我確實請求過要在CMU 裡探視麥加文，"}, {"zh-tw": " And I was approved. That came as quite a shock.", "en": " 而且我就獲准了； 那真的相當令人吃驚，"}, {"zh-tw": " First, because as I've discussedon this stage before, I learned that the FBI has beenmonitoring my work. Second, because it would make me the firstand only journalist to visit a CMU.", "en": " 首先因為如同我已經在這個講台上討論過的， 我早知道 FBI 一直在監看著我的工作， 第二、這會使我成為第一個以及唯一探訪過 CMU 的記者。"}, {"zh-tw": " I had even learned through the Bureau of PrisonsCounterterrorism Unit, that they had been monitoring my speechesabout CMUs, like this one. So how could I possiblybe approved to visit? A few days before I wentout to the prison, I got an answer.", "en": " 我甚至已從聯邦監獄局的反恐單位得知 他們早已一直在監看我有關CMU 的言論 － 就像這一個， 所以我怎麼有可能獲准探訪呢？ 在我出門去監獄的幾天前我得到答案了。"}, {"zh-tw": " I was allowed to visit McGowanas a friend, not a journalist. Journalists are not allowed here.", "en": " 我被允許當成朋友而非記者去探視麥加文， 記者是不准進這邊的；"}, {"zh-tw": " McGowan was told by CMU officialsthat if I asked any questions or published any story, that he would be punishedfor my reporting.

The Bureau of Prisons describes CMUsas \"self-contained housing units.\" But I think that's an Orwellian wayof describing black holes.", "en": " 而且他們還說假使我意圖訪問麥加文的話， 這場探視就會被中斷。 聯邦監獄局形容 CMU 等同「自我閉鎖的房舍單位」， 不過我認為那是歐威爾式的方法來形容黑洞；"}, {"zh-tw": " When you visit a CMU, you go through all the securitycheckpoints that you would expect. But then the walkto the visitation room is silent.", "en": " 當你探視 CMU 時 你會走完所有你預期想到的檢查哨， 但是之後進入會客室的步履是一片寂然。"}, {"zh-tw": " When a CMU prisoner has a visit,the rest of the prison is on lockdown. I was ushered into a small room, so small my outstretched armscould touch each wall.", "en": " 當 CMU 囚犯有人探視時，其餘的囚犯就是被鎖起來了， 我被引領進一個小房間， 我伸展開的手臂能夠碰到各面牆壁如此的小間，"}, {"zh-tw": " There was a grapefruit-sizedorb in the ceiling for the visit to be live-monitoredby the Counterterrorism Unit in West Virginia. The unit insists that all the visitshave to be in English for CMU prisoners, which is an additional hardshipfor many of the Muslim families.", "en": " 那裡有個葡萄般大小的球狀體在天花板上， 為了讓該探視被位於西維吉尼亞的反恐單位即時監看； 該單位堅持對 CMU 囚犯所有的探視必須使用英文， 此點對許多穆斯林家庭來說是額外的難關。"}, {"zh-tw": " There is a thick sheet of foggy,bulletproof glass and on the other side was Daniel McGowan. We spoke through these handsetsattached to the wall and talked about books and movies.", "en": " 那裡有著一片霧面的防彈玻璃， 而且麥加文就在另一頭， 我們透過裝在牆上的電話聽筒講話， 談論著書籍和電影，"}, {"zh-tw": " We did our best to find reasons to laugh. To fight boredom and amuse himselfwhile in the CMU, McGowan had been spreading a rumorthat I was secretly the president of a Twilight fan club in Washington, DC For the record, I'm not.", "en": " 我們盡一切努力找到理由來笑； 在 CMU 裡面的時候為了打破沉悶以及自娛， 麥加文不斷播送一個謠言： 「我是華盛頓特區暮光之城影迷會的不為人知的會長， 在書面紀錄上不是我而已，"}, {"zh-tw": " But I kind of the hope the FBInow thinks that Bella and Edward are terrorist code names. During our visit, McGowan spoke mostand at length about his niece Lily, his wife Jenny and how torturousit feels to never be able to hug them, to never be able to hold their hands.", "en": " 不過我有點希望 FBI 現在認為貝拉還有艾德華是恐怖份子的代號！ 在我們的會面裡麥加文談到最多、最長的是他的姪女莉莉、他的老婆珍妮， 以及永遠沒辦法去擁抱她們、 親執她們的雙手感覺有多麼折騰。"}, {"zh-tw": " Three months after our visit, McGowanwas transferred out of the CMU and then, without warning,he was sent back again. I had published leakedCMU documents on my website and the Counterterrorism Unit saidthat McGowan had called his wife and asked her to mail them.", "en": " 在我們的會面的三個月後麥加文被轉出了 CMU， 接著完全沒有警訊，他再次被送回去了； 我已經在我的網站上公開發表過外流的 CMU 的公文資料， 還有反恐單位說麥加文曾經致電他的妻子 請求她把它們寄出，"}, {"zh-tw": " He wanted to see what the governmentwas saying about him, and for that he was sent back to the CMU. When he was finally releasedat the end of his sentence, his story got even more Kafkaesque.", "en": " 他想要知道政府將會如何說他， 因為這樣他被送回了 CMU。 當他終於在他刑期結束被釋放了出來， 他的事蹟變得甚至更加「卡夫卡式」，"}, {"zh-tw": " He wrote an articlefor the Huffington Post headlined, \"Court Documents Prove I was Sent toa CMU for my Political Speech.\" The next day he was thrownback in jail for his political speech. His attorneys quickly secured his release, but the message was very clear: Don't talk about this place.", "en": " 他寫出一篇文章給赫芬頓郵報做標題為 「法庭文件證實因為我的政治言論我被送去了 CMU ！」 。 隔天就為了他的政治言論他被逮回監獄裡去， 他的律師迅速地確保了他的開釋， 不過訊息非常明確 － 不要講到這地方。"}, {"zh-tw": " Today, nine years after they were openedby the Bush administration, the government is codifyinghow and why CMUs were created. According to the Bureau of Prisons, they are for prisonerswith \"inspirational significance.\" I think that is very nice way of sayingthese are political prisons for political prisoners.", "en": " 在它們被布希政府啟用九年後的今天， 政府正在將 CMU 如何以及為什麼被創造出來建立規章， 根據聯邦監獄局所指 它們是用來關帶有鼓舞型特別意義的囚犯， 我認為這是非常棒的方式來說這些單位是用來關政治犯的政治監獄。"}, {"zh-tw": " Prisoners are sent to a CMUbecause of their race, their religion or theirpolitical beliefs. Now, if you think thatcharacterization is too strong, just look at someof the government's own documents.", "en": " 囚犯們被送往 CMU 是因為其種族、 宗教信仰或是政治理念， 此刻要是你認為該特點強烈到不行， 看一些政府自己的公文就好；"}, {"zh-tw": " When some of McGowan's mail was rejectedby the CMU, the sender was told it's because the letters were intended\"for political prisoners.\" When another prisoner, animal rightsactivist Andy Stepanian, was sent to a CMU, it was because of hisanti-government and anti-corporate views. Now, I know all of thismay be hard to believe, that it's happening right now,and in the United States.", "en": " 當部份麥加文的信件被 CMU 拒收的時候， 寄件人被告知那是因為信函蓄意要給政治犯的。 另一個囚犯 － 動物權運動人士安迪．史迪佩尼恩 被送到 CMU 是因為他的反政府以及反企業觀點。 我知道這所有一切很難置信， 此時此刻在美國它持續發生中，"}, {"zh-tw": " But the unknown realityis that the US has a dark history of disproportionately punishing peoplebecause of their political beliefs. In the 1960s, before Marionwas home to the CMU, it was home to the notorious Control Unit.", "en": " 不過沒人知道的現實 是美國因為政治上的信仰有著過度地處罰人民的黑暗歷史。 在 1960 年代早在馬里昂是 CMU 的所在地前， 它是惡名昭彰的超級戒備單位監獄，"}, {"zh-tw": " Prisoners were locked downin solitary for 22 hours a day.
