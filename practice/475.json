No. No. No. Wrong.", "en": " 這件事戲劇性地改變了我的生命， 到今天為止，在我的兩個中心裡，已有將近一千隻小猩猩。 不，不，不。錯了。"}, {"zh-tw": " It's horrible. It's a proof of our failing to save them in the wild. It's not good.", "en": " 這很糟糕。這不過證明我們失敗了，我們無法在野外救活牠們。 這很不好。"}, {"zh-tw": " This is merely proof of everyone failing to do the right thing.

This is the place where I started.", "en": " 所以我創造一個叫Samboja Lestari的地方 我的想法是， 如果我可以在我想像的到最糟糕最不可能的地方完成這件事 從一個什麼都沒有了的地方 那麼就沒有人會有藉口說，“對啊，但是...” 不會有。這會是每一個人都可以依循的步驟。 所以我們現在在婆羅洲東部。這是我開始著手的地方。"}, {"zh-tw": " As you can see there's only yellow terrain.

So we do the \"people, profit, planet\" principles, but we do it in addition to a sure legal status -- because if the forest belongs to the state, people say, \"It belongs to me, it belongs to everyone.\" And then we apply all these other principles like transparency, professional management, measurable results, scalability, [unclear], etc.", "en": " 這使得當地人成為那片林地的保護者。 我們以“人民、利益、地球”的原則， 並且更進一步地 我們建立一個確定的法律地位 因為假始森林屬於國家的話 人們會說，它屬於我，它屬於每一個人。 我們也應用其他原則 比如說透明化、專業評估管理 可擴展性、往複性...等等。"}, {"zh-tw": " What we did was we formulated recipes -- how to go from a starting situation where you have nothing to a target situation. You formulate a recipe based upon the factors you can control, whether it be the skills or the fertilizer or the plant choice.", "en": " 我們所做的是制定配方 如何從一開始甚麼都沒有的情況 向一個目標前進。 你根據可以控制的因素，制定一個配方 無論選擇技術、化肥、或樹種"}, {"zh-tw": " And then you look at the outputs and you start measuring what comes out. Now in this recipe you also have the cost.", "en": " 你觀測結果，並且測量它。 在這配方裡你同時包含了成本。"}, {"zh-tw": " You also know how much labor is needed. If you can drop this recipe on the map on a sandy soil, on a clay soil, on a steep slope, on flat soil, you put those different recipes; if you combine them, out of that comes a business plan, comes a work plan, and you can optimize it for the amount of labor you have available or for the amount of fertilizer you have, and you can do it.", "en": " 你要知道需要付出多少勞動力 如果你可以把這配方丟在地圖上、 在沙質土壤上、在粘土壤上、 在陡峭的斜坡、在平地上的土壤上、 你配置這些不同的食譜；如果將它們結合起來， 從之而來的一個商業計劃、 以及從之而來的工作計劃，你可以對其進行優化 可以針對對現有的可供勞動力、或現有的肥料， 來完成這計畫。"}, {"zh-tw": " This is how it looks like in practice. We have this grass we want to get rid of. It exudes [unclear]-like compounds from the roots.", "en": " 這就是實行這個計畫所看起來的樣子。我們要擺脫這片荒草地。 它從根處散發著化合物"}, {"zh-tw": " The acacia trees are of a very low value but we need them to restore the micro-climate, to protect the soil and to shake out the grasses. And after eight years they might actually yield some timber -- that is, if you can preserve it in the right way, which we can do with bamboo peels.", "en": " 合歡樹是一個經濟價值非常低的植物 但我們需要它們來恢復微氣候，以保護土壤 並打開這片荒草地。 8年後，這裡可能真會產生一些木材， 也就是說，如果你可以以正確的方法維護它， 我們能做出竹子幼芽"}, {"zh-tw": " It's an old temple-building technique from Japan but bamboo is very fire-susceptible. So if we would plant that in the beginning we would have a very high risk of losing everything again.", "en": " 這是一個古老發源自日本的建築廟宇的技術 但竹子非常容易著火。 所以要是我們一開始就種植竹子的話 我們要承擔失去一切的高風險"}, {"zh-tw": " So we plant it later, along the waterways to filter the water, provide the raw products just in time for when the timber becomes available. So the idea is: how to integrate these flows in space, over time and with the limited means you have.", "en": " 所以我們晚點兒種它，沿著水道 過濾水，只在木材可供使用時 提供原產品。 這樣的想法是：如何在一定的時間與空間內， 使用有限的工具與策略，匯聚資源。"}, {"zh-tw": " So we plant the trees, we plant these pineapples and beans and ginger in between, to reduce the competition for the trees, the crop fertilizer. Organic material is useful for the agricultural crops, for the people, but also helps the trees. The farmers have free land, the system yields early income, the orangutans get healthy food and we can speed up ecosystem regeneration while even saving some money. So beautiful. What a theory.", "en": " 因此我們栽種這些樹，栽種鳳梨 同時種植豆類和生薑在它們之中，以減少樹木與樹木之間的競爭， 作物肥料 -- 有機物質是對農作物有益的， 對人們也是有益的，它也幫助樹木生長，農民有免費土地， 系統獲得初期收益，紅毛猩猩也獲得健康食物 我們可以加快生態系統的再生 這期間甚至也可以節省一些錢。 美麗極了。多好的理論。"}, {"zh-tw": " But is it really that easy? Not really, because if you looked at what happened in 1998, the fire started. This is an area of about 50 million hectares.", "en": " 但是，它真的那麼容易嗎？ 不見得，因為如果你回顧1998年所發生的事情， 火災發生了。 這是一個面積約五千萬公頃的林地。"}, {"zh-tw": " January. February.", "en": " 一月。 二月。"}, {"zh-tw": " March. April.", "en": " 三月。 四月。"}, {"zh-tw": " May. We lost 5.5 million hectares in just a matter of a few months.", "en": " 五月。 我們在短短幾個月之內失去了五百五十萬公頃的林地。"}, {"zh-tw": " This is because we have 10,000 of those underground fires that you also have in Pennsylvania here in the United States. And once the soil gets dried, you're in a dry season -- you get cracks, oxygen goes in, flames come out and the problem starts all over again.", "en": " 因為我們有10,000次左右的這種地下火災 在美國賓州也有。 一旦土壤變得乾燥，旱季會出現裂縫， 氧氣滲入，火災隨而發生，問題又會重新開始。"}, {"zh-tw": " So how to break that cycle? Fire is the biggest problem. This is what it looked like for three months.", "en": " 因此，如何打破這種循環呢？ 火災是最大的問題。 這是三個月看起來的樣子。"}, {"zh-tw": " For three months, the automatic lights outside did not go off because it was that dark. We lost all the crops. No children gained weight for over a year; they lost 12 IQ points. It was a disaster for orangutans and people.", "en": " 三個月間，外邊的自動照明沒有熄滅 因為是那麼黑。 我們失去了所有的作物，一年間沒有一個孩子增加體重。 他們還失去了12點的智商；這對猩猩和人來說 都是一場災難。"}, {"zh-tw": " So these fires are really the first things to work on. That was why I put it as a single point up there.", "en": " 因此，火災是首先真正要處理的工作。 這就是為什麼我在這裡把它作為一個單一重點。"}, {"zh-tw": " And you need the local people for that because these grasslands, once they start burning ... It goes through it like a windstorm and you lose again the last bit of ash and nutrients to the first rainfall -- going to the sea killing off the coral reefs there. So you have to do it with the local people.", "en": " 您需要當地人民，因為這些草原， 一旦開始燃燒，它就會像一場風暴 使你再度失去最後的灰燼與養分 直到第一場雨落到海浬 讓珊瑚礁也死去為止。 所以，你必須與當地人民一起做。"}, {"zh-tw": " That is the short-term solution but you also need a long-term solution. So what we did is, we created a ring of sugar palms around the area.", "en": " 上述僅僅只是短期的解決辦法，而你還需要一個長期的解決辦法。 為此，我們設置了 一個以糖棕櫚樹圍繞出來的一個區域。"}, {"zh-tw": " These sugar palms turn out to be fire-resistant -- also flood-resistant, by the way -- and they provide a lot of income for local people. This is what it looks like: the people have to tap them twice a day -- just a millimeter slice -- and the only thing you harvest is sugar water, carbon dioxide, rain fall and a little bit of sunshine.", "en": " 這些糖棕櫚樹形成一個防火 亦防洪的天然設施。 並且為當地人民提供了大量的收入。 這看起來是這樣的： 人們只在這些樹上刮採幾毫米片，一日兩次， 僅僅採收糖水， 二氧化碳、降雨量和一點點的陽光"}, {"zh-tw": " In principle, you make those trees into biological photovoltaic cells. And you can create so much energy from this -- they produce three times more energy per hectare per year, because you can tap them on a daily basis.", "en": " 原則上你使那些樹木成為 生物光伏電池。 因為他們每年每公頃可以產出3倍以上的能源， 因為你可以將之用於日常工作， 您可以從這裡製造許多的能源。"}, {"zh-tw": " You don't need to harvest [unclear] or any other of the crops. So this is the combination where we have all this genetic potential in the tropics, which is still unexploited, and doing it in combination with technology.", "en": " 您不必採集器官 或任何其他的作物。 因此，這是我們在熱帶所能有的基因潛在結合 它尚未被開發，並且正藉由科技整合做著"}, {"zh-tw": " But also your legal side needs to be in very good order. So we bought that land, and here is where we started our project -- in the middle of nowhere.", "en": " 但此外，你也要有很好的法律知識 所以我們賣下那整塊地 這就是我們開始這項計畫的所在之處， 在一片蠻荒地之中。"}, {"zh-tw": " And if you zoom in a bit you can see that all of this area is divided into strips that go over different types of soil, and we were actually monitoring, measuring every single tree in these 2,000 hectares, 5,000 acres. And this forest is quite different.", "en": " 如果你放大一點，你可以看到所有的這區域 已被不同類型的土壤劃分開來， 事實上，我們仔細考量財務狀況 測量在這5000頃長，2000頃寬地裡的所有樹木。 這個森林很不同。"}, {"zh-tw": " What I really did was I just followed nature, and nature doesn't know monocultures, but a natural forest is multilayered. That means that both in the ground and above the ground it can make better use of the available light, it can store more carbon in the system, it can provide more functions.", "en": " 我們真正做的只是依自然的性質， 而自然本身是不了解何謂單種栽培的， 且自然森林有多種層次。 這意謂著，森林可以較好地利用 地面以及地面以上的光， 可以在生態系統中儲存更多碳，提供更多功能，"}, {"zh-tw": " But, it's more complicated. It's not that simple, and you have to work with the people. So, just like nature, we also grow fast planting trees and underneath that, we grow the slower growing, primary-grain forest trees of a very high diversity that can optimally use that light. Then, what is just as important: get the right fungi in there that will grow into those leaves, bring back the nutrients to the roots of the trees that have just dropped that leaf within 24 hours.", "en": " 然而這也較為複雜，並不像表面上那麼容易，你需要與當地住民合作，一起工作。 所以我們的作法是仿效自然， 種植快速生長的樹木，同時在那之下 我們種植生長較為慢的植物，也就是非常高多樣性的初級糧作林木 使它們得以較好地利用陽光 同樣重要得是：它們得以取得適當的菌類 這些菌類可以附著生長於它們的葉內，從24小時內掉落的葉子 中帶養分回樹根之中。"}, {"zh-tw": " And they become like nutrient pumps. You need the bacteria to fix nitrogen, and without those microorganisms, you won't have any performance at all.", "en": " 他們會成為養分泵 而你也需要土壤中的固氮微生物 若少了這些微生物，你將不會有任何成果。"}, {"zh-tw": " And then we started planting -- only 1,000 trees a day. We could have planted many, many more, but we didn't want to because we wanted to keep the number of jobs stable.", "en": " 接著，我們著手開始植林 -- 一天只栽種1000棵樹。 其實可以栽種更多的，但我們不想 因為我們希望保持穩定的就業數量。"}, {"zh-tw": " We didn't want to lose the people that are going to work in that plantation. And we do a lot of work here.", "en": " 我們不希望失去人 他們要在林業上工作。 而我們有需多工作要做。"}, {"zh-tw": " We use indicator plants to look at what soil types, or what vegetables will grow, or what trees will grow here. And we have monitored every single one of those trees from space.", "en": " 我們使用指標性植物觀測土壤類型， 看看什麼植物或什麼樹種會生長出來。 我們在這區域內已經監測了每一棵樹。"}, {"zh-tw": " This is what it looks like in reality; you have this irregular ring around it, with strips of 100 meters wide, with sugar palms that can provide income for 648 families. It's only a small part of the area.", "en": " 這是它現實中看起來的樣子， 你在這周圍有不規則環， 100公尺寬的的環帶內種植的是糖棕櫚 可以提供648個家庭生計。 這只是此區域的一個小部分。"}, {"zh-tw": " The nursery, in here, is quite different. If you look at the number of tree species we have in Europe, for instance, from the Urals up to England, you know how many? 165.", "en": " 這裡的培植區是相當不同的。 如果你看我們樹木種類的樹木，比如說歐洲好了， 從俄羅斯的烏拉爾到英格蘭，你知道有多少嗎？ 165"}, {"zh-tw": " In this nursery, we're going to grow 10 times more than the number of species. Can you imagine? You do need to know what you are working with, but it's that diversity which makes it work.", "en": " 在這裡的培植區，我們要種植10倍以上的樹種。 你們能想像嗎？ 你必須知道你正在做什麼， 但恰恰是多樣性使計畫得以運作。"}, {"zh-tw": " That you can go from this zero situation, by planting the vegetables and the trees, or directly, the trees in the lines in that grass there, putting up the buffer zone, producing your compost, and then making sure that at every stage of that up growing forest there are crops that can be used. In the beginning, maybe pineapples and beans and corn; in the second phase, there will be bananas and papayas; later on, there will be chocolate and chilies.", "en": " 使你可以從零開始， 藉著種植蔬菜與樹木，或著直接栽種樹木， 在那草原線上， 設置緩衝區，生產堆肥， 然後，確保正在成長的森林的每一個階段 都有作物可供使用。 一開始，可能先是鳳梨、蘋果、和玉米。 第二階段，會有香蕉和木瓜。 接著，會有椰子和辣椒。"}, {"zh-tw": " And then slowly, the trees start taking over, bringing in produce from the fruits, from the timber, from the fuel wood. And finally, the sugar palm forest takes over and provides the people with permanent income.", "en": " 然後慢慢地，樹木開始接管， 從水果、從木材、從薪柴，帶來產出， 最終，糖棕櫚接管 給予人們永久的收入。"}, {"zh-tw": " On the top left, underneath those green stripes, you see some white dots -- those are actually individual pineapple plants that you can see from space. And in that area we started growing some acacia trees that you just saw before.", "en": " 在左上角，下面這些綠色條紋， 你看到一些白點 -- 這些實際上是個別的鳳梨樹 你可以從太空中看見 在這些區域，我們開始栽種越來越多的合歡樹 如同你們之前所見到的"}, {"zh-tw": " So this is after one year. And this is after two years.", "en": " 這是一年後的樣子。 這是兩年後。"}, {"zh-tw": " And that's green. If you look from the tower -- this is when we start attacking the grass. We plant in the seedlings mixed with the bananas, the papayas, all the crops for the local people, but the trees are growing up fast in between as well.", "en": " 螢幕上，如果你從電塔看過去 這是我們開始著手的地方。 我們栽種幼苗 混合香蕉、番木瓜、以及所有當地居民的作物， 但同時樹木也在它們之間快速成長"}, {"zh-tw": " And three years later, 137 species of birds are living here.
