But here's the thing: We are the only advanced civilizationin the solar system, but that doesn't mean that there isno microbial life nearby.", "en": " 環境之惡劣與嚴峻，令我自己都望而却步。 普遍認同的觀點是， 雖然人類社會是太陽系唯一的高等文明， 但並不意味著，附近星系沒有微生物存在。"}, {"zh-tw": " In fact, the planetsand moons you see here could host life -- all of them --and we know that, and it's a strong possibility. And if we were going to find lifeon those moons and planets, then we would answer questions such as, are we alone in the solar system? Where are we coming from? Do we have family in the neighborhood? Is there life beyond our solar system? And we can ask all those questionsbecause there has been a revolution in our understandingof what a habitable planet is, and today, a habitable planet is a planet that has a zone wherewater can stay stable, but to me this is a horizontaldefinition of habitability, because it involves a distance to a star, but there is anotherdimension to habitability, and this is a vertical dimension.", "en": " 像這些行星及其衛星 都有可能是生命的家園， 我們對此較爲確信。 一旦在這些星球上發現生命， 我們也許能回答以下問題： 太陽系裏人類是否孑然一身？ 我們來自何方？ 附近星系中是否有我們的親戚？ 太陽系之外是否有生命存在？ 諸如此類的問題沒有窮盡， 因爲對於什麽星球適合生存、居住，我們的認識一直在變化。 時至今日，我們認爲適宜居住的星球 應該環繞著大氣圈，幫助保持水分。 但對我而言，這只是衡量適宜居住的一個橫軸， 只要與恒星之間存在合適的距離即可滿足這一要求； 還需要有一個衡量維度—— 縱軸，"}, {"zh-tw": " Think of it as conditions in the subsurface of a planetwhere you are very far away from a sun, but you still have water,energy, nutrients, which for some of them means food, and a protection.
