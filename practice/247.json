Now, the term \"information society,\" \"information economy,\" for a very long time has been used as the thing that comes after the industrial revolution. But in fact, for purposes of understanding what's happening today, that's wrong.

Around June 2002, the world of supercomputers had a bombshell. The Japanese had, for the first time, created the fastest supercomputer -- the NEC Earth Simulator -- taking the primary from the U.S., and about two years later -- this, by the way, is measuring the trillion floating-point operations per second that the computer's capable of running -- sigh of relief: IBM [Blue Gene] has just edged ahead of the NEC Earth Simulator.", "en": " 現在，讓我告訴大家另一個故事 大約在 2002 年六月，超級電腦的領域有了爆炸性的事件 日本人首次建造了最快的超級電腦，超越了原先居冠的美國 那就是 NEC 地球模擬器 兩年之後…順帶一提 這張圖表示電腦每秒能夠進行的浮點運算次數 我們後來終於鬆了一口氣。兩年後，NEC 的地球模擬器終於被 IBM 的藍色基因以些微差距給超越"}, {"zh-tw": " All of this completely ignores the fact that throughout this period, there's another supercomputer running in the world -- SETI@home.

Not that it's become less capital intensive -- that there's less money that's required -- but that the ownership of this capital, the way the capitalization happens, is radically distributed. Each of us, in these advanced economies, has one of these, or something rather like it -- a computer. They're not radically different from routers inside the middle of the network.", "en": " 這個事件告訴我們的是，我們生產資訊的方式有了重大改變 資訊的交換也已經資本化了 這不是說資訊生產比較不資本密集了，比較不需要錢了 而是說，資本的擁有，也就是資本化的發生變得更分散了 我們每一個人，在當前發達的經濟時代下 都擁有一台電腦，或類似電腦的東西 它們和網絡中的路由器沒有根本的差異"}, {"zh-tw": " And computation, storage and communications capacity are in the hands of practically every connected person -- and these are the basic physical capital means necessary for producing information, knowledge and culture, in the hands of something like 600 million to a billion people around the planet. What this means is that for the first time since the industrial revolution, the most important means, the most important components of the core economic activities -- remember, we are in an information economy -- of the most advanced economies, and there more than anywhere else, are in the hands of the population at large. This is completely different than what we've seen since the industrial revolution. So we've got communications and computation capacity in the hands of the entire population, and we've got human creativity, human wisdom, human experience -- the other major experience, the other major input -- which unlike simple labor -- stand here turning this lever all day long -- is not something that's the same or fungible among people.", "en": " 每一個能連上網路的人，都擁有計算、儲存和交換訊息的能力 而這些基本的資本設備 正是世界上六到十億人 所擁有能夠用來生產資訊、知識和文化的必要之物 這意味著，自從工業革命之後 在經濟發達的時代裡，最重要的生產手段，經濟活動的核心 記住，我們正處在資訊經濟 這些經濟活動的核心要素 第一次分散在廣大的民眾手裡 這個景象完全不同於工業革命以來的情形不同 全體民眾掌握了訊息的交流和計算能力 我們還有創造力、智慧和體驗 這是另一個重要的生產投入 這種投入與單純的勞動不一樣，單純的勞動是指整天站在這裡轉動控制桿 我們的創造力、智慧和體驗是不同或無法替代的"}, {"zh-tw": " Any one of you who has taken someone else's job, or tried to give yours to someone else, no matter how detailed the manual, you cannot transmit what you know, what you will intuit under a certain set of circumstances.

But, in fact, of course, the story is it's the 70 percent, including the major e-commerce site -- 70 percent of a critical application on which Web-based communications and applications work is produced in this form, in direct competition with Microsoft.

After six months, 85,000 people used this to generate mapping at a faster rate than the images were coming in, which was, quote, \"practically indistinguishable from the markings of a fully-trained Ph.D.,\" once you showed it to a number of people and computed the average.

No one owns it, no one owns the output, it's free for anyone to use and it's the output of people acting out of social and psychological motivations to do something interesting.
