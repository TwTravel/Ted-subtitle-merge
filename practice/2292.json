No one wears trouserswith a waistband quite that high in this day and age."}, {"zh-tw": "這是我和我的曾祖父，順帶一提，那不是真的耳朵。我們很親近。我會坐在他腿上聽他的礦工故事。", "en": "But yet, that's mewith my great-grandfather, and by the way, they are nothis real ears. We were close. I remember sitting onhis knee listening to his mining stories."}, {"zh-tw": "他會說那些地下的同袍之誼，他們會把三明治的吐司邊留下，餵給礦坑拉車的小馬。就像昨天才發生。", "en": "He talked of the camaraderie underground, and the fact that the miners used to savethe crusts of their sandwiches to give to the poniesthey worked with underground. It was like it was yesterday."}, {"zh-tw": "在我的學習過程中，我曾上世界煤礦協會的網站，在首頁的中間寫著：「煤礦存量可供 118 年使用。」我還想，至少有生之年用不完，而且比石油存量多多了。但我一算，發現我曾祖父，正是網站所說的 118 年前出生。我坐在他的膝上直到 11 歲，我發現那其實很短，無論就時間或歷史來說。", "en": "And on my journey of learning, I went to the WorldCoal Association website, and there in the middleof the homepage, it said, \"We have about 118 years of coal left.\" And I thought to myself, well,that's well outside my lifetime, and a much greater figurethan the predictions for oil. But I did the math, and I realizedthat my great-grandfather had been born exactly 118 yearsbefore that year, and I sat on his kneeuntil I was 11 years old, and I realized it's nothing in time, nor in history."}, {"zh-tw": "這讓我下了一個意想不到的決定：不再從事單人航海的運動，更專注在我從未遇過的大挑戰：全球經濟的未來。我很快發現不只是能源，", "en": "And it made me make a decisionI never thought I would make: to leave the sportof solo sailing behind me and focus on the greatest challengeI'd ever come across: the future of our global economy. And I quickly realized it wasn'tjust about energy."}, {"zh-tw": "原料也岌岌可危。2008 年，我看了一篇科學研究，想知道我們還有多少年，可以從地下獲取珍貴資源。銅 61 年；錫、鋅 40 年；銀 29 年。", "en": "It was also materials. In 2008, I picked up a scientific study looking at how many years we have of valuable materialsto extract from the ground: copper, 61; tin, zinc, 40; silver, 29."}, {"zh-tw": "這些數字未必精確，但至少確定有用完的一天。我們只能用一次。", "en": "These figures couldn't be exact,but we knew those materials were finite. We only have them once."}, {"zh-tw": "但我們消耗的速度卻快速增加，呈指數成長。地球上有越多人、越多需求，100 年來，我們親眼目睹使用期限只有 10 年的生活必需品不斷降價。", "en": "And yet, our speed that we've usedthese materials has increased rapidly, exponentially. With more people in the worldwith more stuff, we've effectively seen100 years of price declines in those basic commoditieserased in just 10 years."}, {"zh-tw": "這影響我們每個人，也帶來了價格的巨大浮動。影響之大，在 2011年，歐洲的汽車製造商都發現，原物料的價格漲了5 億歐元。吃掉了他們一半的利潤，而且他們無能為力。", "en": "And this affects all of us. It's brought huge volatility in prices, so much so that in 2011, your average European car manufacturer saw a raw material price increase of 500 million Euros, wiping away half their operating profits through something they haveabsolutely no control over."}, {"zh-tw": "當了解越多，我的生活也開始發生改變。我開始少旅遊、少做、少消耗。", "en": "And the more I learned, the moreI started to change my own life. I started traveling less,doing less, using less."}, {"zh-tw": "我發現我們該做的就是「少做」。但這很難做到，", "en": "It felt like actually doing lesswas what we had to do. But it sat uneasy with me."}, {"zh-tw": "覺得哪裡怪怪的。好像我們只是在拖延時間，", "en": "It didn't feel right. It felt like we werebuying ourselves time."}, {"zh-tw": "只是讓資源可以用久一點。就算大家改變習慣，問題還是沒解決。", "en": "We were eking things out a bit longer. Even if everybody changed,it wouldn't solve the problem."}, {"zh-tw": "整個大環境還是一樣。轉型很重要，但我在想的是，要轉型成怎樣？怎樣才能解決問題？我想到這個系統本身，我們存在的這個架構，本質是有缺陷的。所以我最後明白，整個經濟的運作模式，「經濟」被建構成一個「系統」。", "en": "It wouldn't fix the system. It was vital in the transition,but what fascinated me was, in the transition to what?What could actually work? It struck me that the system itself,the framework within which we live, is fundamentally flawed, and I realized ultimately that our operating system,the way our economy functions, the way our economy's been built,is a system in itself."}, {"zh-tw": "在海上，我必須了解複雜的系統。有很多輸入，我去處理它們，我要更了解系統才能贏，", "en": "At sea, I had to understandcomplex systems. I had to take multiple inputs, I had to process them, and I had to understand the system to win."}, {"zh-tw": "我必須去理解。所以我發現全球經濟也是個系統，卻不是個可以長久運作的系統。", "en": "I had to make sense of it. And as I looked at our global economy,I realized it too is that system, but it's a system that effectivelycan't run in the long term."}, {"zh-tw": "在過去 150 年，我們已經把「線性經濟」發揮到極致：從地表下取出資源，做出點產品，然後最後用完了，產品就被丟棄。我們的確實有在回收，但到最後只想試圖擺脫，而不是有計畫再利用什麼。這種設計本來就不為了長久。如果我們知道資源有限，為什麼要用一個不斷丟棄，然後會造成浪費的系統？生命已經存在數十億年之久，不斷試著去有效運用資源。", "en": "And I realized we've been perfectingwhat's effectively a linear economy for 150 years, where we take a materialout of the ground, we make something out of it,and then ultimately that product gets thrown away,and yes, we do recycle some of it, but more an attempt to get outwhat we can at the end, not by design. It's an economy that fundamentallycan't run in the long term, and if we know that wehave finite materials, why would we build an economythat would effectively use things up, that would create waste? Life itself has existedfor billions of years and has continually adaptedto use materials effectively."}, {"zh-tw": "聽起來複雜，但這樣就沒有所謂「垃圾」，每個產物被代謝掉了。", "en": "It's a complex system,but within it, there is no waste. Everything is metabolized."}, {"zh-tw": "不是「線性經濟」，而是「循環經濟」。我就像當年坐在院子裡，", "en": "It's not a linear economyat all, but circular. And I felt like the child in the garden."}, {"zh-tw": "初次踏上新旅程，我可以預見我們的發展。如果經濟是「用」但不「用完」，我們的未來就可以持續下去。", "en": "For the first time on this new journey,I could see exactly where we were headed. If we could build an economy that woulduse things rather than use them up, we could build a future that reallycould work in the long term."}, {"zh-tw": "我好興奮。這是值得努力的目標。", "en": "I was excited. This was something to work towards."}, {"zh-tw": "我們有目標，只是要想怎麼達成，也就是這樣的想法，我們在 2010 年 9 月，創辦了艾倫麥克阿瑟基金會。很多學派接受我們的論點，並結合工業共棲、效益經濟、共享經濟、生物擬態，當然，還有「搖籃到搖籃」的設計。", "en": "We knew exactly where we were headed.We just had to work out how to get there, and it was exactly with this in mind that we created the Ellen MacArthurFoundation in September 2010.

What if we could collectfood waste, human waste? What if we could turn thatinto fertilizer, heat, energy, ultimately reconnecting nutrients systems and rebuilding natural capital? And cars -- what we wantis to move around. We don't need to ownthe materials within them."}, {"zh-tw": "未來可能以服務的形式，購買「移動」這項產品。乍聽之下很神奇，但這都是真實存在。這就是「循環經濟」的核心。我們要做的是去擴充、升級。", "en": "Could cars become a service and provide us withmobility in the future? All of this sounds amazing, but thesearen't just ideas, they're real today, and these lie at the forefrontof the circular economy. What lies before us is to expand themand scale them up."}, {"zh-tw": "要怎麼從線性變成循環經濟呢？我們基金會的團隊就想，要和世界一流的院校合作、和世界知名的企業合作、與世界最大的智庫平台合作、還有各國政府。你可能想和專家共事，問他們：你可能想和專家共事，問他們：「循環經濟可以讓經濟成長，不再受制於有限資源嗎？」「循環經濟可以重建自然資本嗎？」「「循環經濟可以取代化肥使用嗎？」答案：是的，而且我們還可以取代現代化肥，化肥使用也可以減少 2.7 倍。", "en": "So how would you shiftfrom linear to circular? Well, the team and I at the foundationthought you might want to work with the top universities in the world, with leading businesses within the world, with the biggest conveningplatforms in the world, and with governments.
