You can see the sky.", "en": " 可能是因為監獄是一個相當大的開放空間。 你可以看到天空。"}, {"zh-tw": " Seagulls fly overhead,and you feel like you're next to the sea, that you're really close to the beach. But in fact, the gulls are lookingfor food in the dump near the prison.", "en": " 海鷗從頭上飛過，你覺得好像在海邊， 非常靠近沙灘。 但實際上，海鷗是在監獄附近的垃圾堆找食物。"}, {"zh-tw": " I went farther inside and I suddenly sawinmates moving across the corridors. Then it was as if I stepped backand thought that I could have very well beenone of them.", "en": " 我走進去 突然看到囚犯在穿過走廊。 然後我好像停下來 在想我也有可能 是他們中間的一份子。"}, {"zh-tw": " If I had another story,another context, different luck. Because nobody - nobody -can choose where they're born.", "en": " 如果我有另一個人生故事，在另一個時空，不同的運氣。 因為沒有人－ 沒有人 －可以選擇他們的出生地。"}, {"zh-tw": " In 2009, I was invited to join a project that San Martín National Universityconducted at the Unit 48 penitentiary, to coordinate a writing workshop. The prison service ceded some landat the end of the prison, which is where they constructedthe University Center building.", "en": " 在2009年，我應邀參與 聖‧馬丁國立大學在48號感化院所舉辦的 一個協調寫作班的專案。 獄方在監牢盡頭的一塊地上 蓋了一個大學中心的建築物。"}, {"zh-tw": " The first time I met with the prisoners, I asked them why they were askingfor a writing workshop and they told me they wanted to put on paper all that they couldn't say and do. Right then I decided that I wanted poetryto enter the prison.", "en": " 我第一次見與囚犯見面時， 我問他們為什麼他們要求上寫作課 他們告訴我他們要將他們無法說和做的事情 寫在紙上。 那時我就決定我要將詩引進監獄。"}, {"zh-tw": " So I said to themwhy don't we work with poetry, if they knew what poetry was. But nobody had a cluewhat poetry really was.", "en": " 我就告訴他們如果你們知道詩是什麼 我們何不寫詩。 但沒有人真正知道詩是什麼。"}, {"zh-tw": " They also suggested to me that the workshop should benot just for the inmates taking university classes, but for all the inmates. And so I saidthat to start this workshop, I needed to find a toolthat we all had in common.", "en": " 他們也向我建議 這個班應該不應只是讓想要上 大學課程的囚犯參加，所有囚犯應該都可參加。 我同意後就開始了這個寫作課。 我必須先找一個我們都知道的工具。"}, {"zh-tw": " That tool was language. We had language, we had the workshop.We could have poetry.", "en": " 那個工具就是語言。 我們有語言，我們有這個課。我們就可以有詩。"}, {"zh-tw": " But what I hadn't consideredwas that inequality exists in prison, too.

They didn't write fluently, either.", "en": " 許多不會寫草書，只會一點正楷。 他們無法流暢的寫。"}, {"zh-tw": " So we started looking for short poems. Very short, but very powerful.", "en": " 所以我們開始找短詩。 很短有很有力的短詩。"}, {"zh-tw": " And we started to read, and we'd readone author, then another author, and by reading such short poems,they all began to realize that what the poetic language didwas to break a certain logic, and create another system. Breaking the logic of languagealso breaks the logic of the system under which they've learned to respond.", "en": " 然後我們開始讀詩，我們讀過一個詩人的詩再讀另一個的， 在讀這些短詩，他們都開始理解 詩的語言可以破壞某些邏輯， 然後創造另一個系統。 破壞語言的邏輯同時也破壞了系統的邏輯 在那系統下他們已習慣去反應。"}, {"zh-tw": " So a new system appeared, new rules that made themunderstand very quickly, - very quickly - that with poetic language they would be able to sayabsolutely whatever they wanted. It's said that to be a poetyou have to go to hell and back.", "en": " 因此一個新的系統出現了， 讓他們很快能了解的新的規則， － 很快的 － 藉新規則和詩的語言 他們可以完全表達他們想要的。 有人說要成為詩人你必須去過地獄後再回來。"}, {"zh-tw": " And they have plenty of hell.Plenty of hell.

All the things that go unwritten --all of that is poetry.\" So we started appropriating that hell; we plunged ourselves, headfirst,into the seventh circle.", "en": " 你們所說的你不能睡覺， 它滲出恐懼。 所有這些你沒有寫出來的 －所有這些就是詩。」 我們開始掌握這個地獄； 我們將自己，頭向下，投入第七圈地獄。"}, {"zh-tw": " And in that seventh circle of hell,our very own, beloved circle, they learned that they couldmake the walls invisible, that they could make the windows yell, and that we could hide inside the shadows. When the first yearof the workshop had ended, we organized a little closing party, like you do when a job is donewith so much love, and you want to celebrate with a party.", "en": " 在第七圈地獄，我們自己的，最鍾愛的一圈， 他們學到他們可以讓牆壁消失， 他們可以讓窗戶咆哮， 我們可以躲在影子下。 當第一年的寫作課結束時， 我們籌組了一個結業派對， 就像你們用許多的愛做完一件工作後， 你想要用一個派對來慶祝。"}, {"zh-tw": " We called family, friends, the university authorities. The only thing the inmateshad to do was read a poem, and receive their diplomas and applause.", "en": " 我們邀請家人，朋友，大學的長官們。 這些囚犯學生唯一要做的就是朗讀一首詩， 然後接受他們的文憑和掌聲。"}, {"zh-tw": " That was our simple party. The only thing I want to leave you with is the moment in which those men, some of them just hugewhen standing next to me, or the young boys - so young,but with an enormous pride, held their papers and trembledlike little kids and sweated, and read their poems with theirvoices completely broken.", "en": " 那就是我們簡單的派對。 我唯一要留下來的 就是這些人的一些瞬間， 他們有些站在我旁邊時顯得非常巨大， 或著是年輕的男孩 － 非常年輕，但是很有榮譽的， 拿著紙張，他們像小孩子一樣顫抖著，滿身大汗， 在朗讀他們的詩時，聲音斷斷續續。"}, {"zh-tw": " That moment made me think a lot that for most of them,it was surely the very first time that someone applauded themfor something they had done. In prison there are thingsthat can't be done.", "en": " 這些瞬間讓我想了許多 對他們許多人來說，這是他們的第一次 第一次有人因為他們所做的向他們鼓掌。 在監獄裏有許多不能做的事。"}, {"zh-tw": " In prison, you can't dream.In prison, you can't cry.

We decidedthat they were going to write a book.", "en": " 但是我們敢夢，要做許多夢。 我們決定我們要寫一本書。"}, {"zh-tw": " Not only did they write a book,but they also bound it themselves. That was at the end of 2010.", "en": " 他們不只寫了一本書，他們還自己裝訂。 那是2010年底。"}, {"zh-tw": " Then, we doubled the betand wrote another book. And we bound that one, too.", "en": " 然後，我們加碼再寫了另一本書。 我們也裝訂了那一本。"}, {"zh-tw": " That was a short time ago,at the end of last year. What I see week after week, is how they're turninginto different people; how they're being transformed.", "en": " 那是不久以前，去年底。 我在一週又一週所看到的， 是他們如何轉變成不同的人； 他們如何被轉化。"}, {"zh-tw": " How words are empowering themwith a dignity they had never known, that they couldn't even imagine. They had no idea such dignitycould come from them.", "en": " 言語如何使他們得到他們從未有的尊嚴， 那是他們從來甚至沒有想像的。 他們從不知道他們可以有這樣的尊嚴。"}, {"zh-tw": " At the workshop, in that beloved hellwe share, we all give something.

They recognize themselves,they look at themselves in the poem and write from who they are,and are from what they write.", "en": " 它創造一個鏡子，那就是詩。 他們認識他們是誰，他們在詩裏看著自己 從他們是誰寫詩，詩裏寫的就是他們是誰"}, {"zh-tw": " In order to write, they need to appropriatethe moment of writing which is a momentof extraordinary freedom. They have to get into their heads,search for that bit of freedom that can never be taken awaywhen they write and that is also usefulto realize that freedom is possible even inside a prison, and that the only bars we havein our wonderful space is the word \"bars,\" and that all of us in our hellburn with happiness when we light the wick of the word.", "en": " 為了寫詩， 他們需要擁有寫作的瞬間 那是一個不尋常的自由的瞬間。 他們必須在自己的頭腦裏，找尋那一點的自由 那個自由在他們寫的時候，是無人可以拿走的 了解自由的可能也是很有用的 甚至在監獄裏， 我們在這個美好的空間裏唯有的欄杆 就是「欄杆」這個字眼， 當我們點著字詞的蕊心。 我們全體在我們的地獄裏被快樂所燃燒 （鼓掌）"}, {"zh-tw": " I told you a lot about the prison,a lot about what I experience every week, and how I enjoy itand transform myself with the inmates. But you don't know how much I'd like it if you could feel, live, experience,even for a few seconds, what I enjoy every weekand what makes me who I am.", "en": " （掌聲停止） 我已告訴你們許多我在監獄的經歷 每一週，我如何享受這個經歷，如何與囚犯一起轉化自我。 但是你們無法知道我喜愛的程度 如果你可以感覺到，如我過著，經驗著即使是幾秒， 我每週所享受的和什麼造就了現在的我。"}, {"zh-tw": " Martín Bustamante: The heart chews tears of time; blinded by that light, it hides the speed of existence where the images go rowing by. It fights; it hangs on.", "en": " 馬丁‧佈斯塔曼特：這個心咀嚼時間的眼淚； 被亮光蒙蔽， 它隱藏存在的速度 那裏影像划著過去。 它搏鬥；它抓著不放。"}, {"zh-tw": " The heart cracks under sad gazes, rides on storms that spread fire, lifts chests lowered by shame, knows that it's not just readingand going on, it also wishes to see the infinite blue.
