I want us, in the next decade, to build a space telescope that'll be able to image an Earth about another star and figure out whether it can harbor life. My colleagues at the NASAJet Propulsion Laboratory at Princeton and I are working on technology that will be able to do just that in the coming years.", "en": " 宇宙裡到處都有行星 我想要我們在下個十年里 建一台太空望遠鏡 可以拍攝到繞著另一顆恆星的另一個地球 並弄清它是否可以孕育生命 我和美國太空總署噴氣推進實驗室的同事 在普林斯頓正在研發 可以在未來實現這技術"}, {"zh-tw": " Astronomers now believe that every star in the galaxy has a planet, and they speculate that up to one fifth of them have an Earth-like planet that might be able to harbor life, but we haven't seen any of them. We've only detected them indirectly.", "en": " 天文學家現在相信銀河系裡的 每顆恆星都有一個行星 並且他們推測其中多達五分之一 是像地球一樣的行星 也許能夠孕育生命 但是我們到現在一個也沒有看見 我們只是間接地探測"}, {"zh-tw": " This is NASA's famous picture of the pale blue dot. It was taken by the Voyager spacecraft in 1990, when they turned it around asit was exiting the solar system to take a picture of the Earth from six billion kilometers away.", "en": " 這是美國太空總署著名的暗淡藍點照片 照片由旅行者號探測器拍攝於1990年 當它準備離開太陽系的時候轉了個頭 從六十億公里遠外 拍攝了地球的照片"}, {"zh-tw": " I want to take that of an Earth-like planet about another star. Why haven't we done that? Why is that hard? Well to see, let's imagine we take the Hubble Space Telescope and we turn it around and we move it out to the orbit of Mars.", "en": " 我想要拍張 環繞其它恆星的另一個地球的照片 為什麼我們還沒有這麼做？為什麼這麼難？ 好吧，我們來想像 把哈勃太空望遠鏡 轉過頭來 並移到火星軌道"}, {"zh-tw": " We'll see something like that, a slightly blurry picture of the Earth, because we're a fairly small telescope out at the orbit of Mars. Now let's move ten times further away.", "en": " 我們會看到類似這樣的東西 一張略為模糊的地球照片 因為我們是位於火星軌道的 一台相當小的望遠鏡 現在我們移到十倍遠外"}, {"zh-tw": " Here we are at the orbit of Uranus. It's gotten smaller, it's got less detail, less resolve.", "en": " 我們現在在天王星軌道 它變得更小，細節更少，分辨率更低"}, {"zh-tw": " We can still see the little moon, but let's go ten times further away again. Here we are at the edge of the solar system, out at the Kuiper Belt.", "en": " 我們仍能看到小小的月亮 但是讓我們再遠離十倍 現在我們到了太陽系的邊緣 在柯伊伯帶"}, {"zh-tw": " Now it's not resolved at all. It's that pale blue dot of Carl Sagan's.", "en": " 現在就無法解析了 它是卡爾·薩根的暗淡藍點"}, {"zh-tw": " But let's move yet again ten times further away. Here we are out at the Oort Cloud, outside the solar system, and we're starting to see the sun move into the field of view and get into where the planet is.", "en": " 但是讓我們再遠離十倍 我們到了奧爾特雲 太陽系外 我們開始看到太陽 進入了視野 取代了地球的位置"}, {"zh-tw": " One more time, ten times further away. Now we're at Alpha Centauri, our nearest neighbor star, and the planet is gone.", "en": " 再一次的，十倍遠外 我們現在到了半人馬座阿爾法星 我們最近的鄰居恆星 現在完全看不見地球"}, {"zh-tw": " All we're seeing is the big beaming image of the star that's ten billion times brighter than the planet, which should be in that little red circle. That's what we want to see. That's why it's hard.", "en": " 我們僅能看到大的發光的恆星 比地球亮一百億倍 地球應該在那個小紅圈內 那是我們想要看到的。這就是為什麼這麼難。"}, {"zh-tw": " The light from the star is diffracting. It's scattering inside the telescope, creating that very bright image that washes out the planet.", "en": " 恆星發的光會衍射 會在望遠鏡裡散射 製造很亮的圖像 掩蓋了地球"}, {"zh-tw": " So to see the planet, we have to do something about all of that light. We have to get rid of it.", "en": " 所以為了看到地球 我們必須對這些光做點什麼 我們必須除掉它"}, {"zh-tw": " I have a lot of colleagues working on really amazing technologies to do that, but I want to tell you about one today that I think is the coolest, and probably the most likely to get us an Earth in the next decade. It was first suggested by Lyman Spitzer, the father of the space telescope, in 1962, and he took his inspiration from an eclipse.", "en": " 我有很多同事正在研發 很多可以做到這點的驚人的科技 但是今天我想告訴你其中一個 我認為是最酷的 而且是最可能幫我們 在下個十年看到另一個地球 它首先被太空望遠鏡之父 萊曼·史匹哲在1962年提出 他從日蝕中得到靈感"}, {"zh-tw": " You've all seen that. That's a solar eclipse. The moon has moved in front of the sun.", "en": " 你們都看過日蝕 月亮移到太陽前面"}, {"zh-tw": " It blocks out most of the light so we can see that dim corona around it. It would be the same thing if I put my thumb up and blocked that spotlightthat's getting right in my eye, I can see you in the back row.", "en": " 阻擋了大部分光 所以我們能看到太陽外層黯淡的日冕 這個效果就如同 如果我把大拇指放到眼前擋住那個聚光燈 我可以看見後面幾排的人們"}, {"zh-tw": " Well, what's going on? Well the moon is casting a shadow down on the Earth. We put a telescope or a camera in that shadow, we look back at the sun, and most of the light's been removed and we can see that dim, fine structure in the corona.", "en": " 那麼，這是什麼情況？ 事實上月亮 在地球表面印出了一個影子 我們把望遠鏡或者相機放在影子裡 我們再去看太陽 大部分光線就被擋住了 我們可以看見日冕裡 暗淡的細節結構"}, {"zh-tw": " Spitzer's suggestion was we do this in space. We build a big screen, we fly it in space, we put it up in front of the star, we block out most of the light, we fly a space telescope inthat shadow that's created, and boom, we get to see planets.", "en": " 史匹哲的建議我們在太空裡這麼做 我們建一個巨大的擋板發射到太空 我們把它放在恆星前面 擋住大部分光線 再發射一個天文望遠鏡到製造的影子裡 從而，我們可以看見行星"}, {"zh-tw": " Well that would look something like this. So there's that big screen, and there's no planets, because unfortunately it doesn'tactually work very well, because the light waves of the light and waves diffracts around that screen the same way it did in the telescope.", "en": " 這個想法看起來就像這樣 這就是那個大螢幕， 但是並沒有行星 因為很不幸的是那並不能很好的工作 因為光波 在螢幕周圍衍射 和在望遠鏡中一樣"}, {"zh-tw": " It's like water bending around a rock in a stream, and all that light just destroys the shadow. It's a terrible shadow. And we can't see planets.", "en": " 就像是溪流中的水繞過石頭 所以這些光就把影子破壞了，變成糟糕的影子 這樣我們看不見行星"}, {"zh-tw": " But Spitzer actually knew the answer. If we can feather the edges, soften those edges so we can control diffraction, well then we can see a planet, and in the last 10 years or so we've come up with optimal solutions for doing that.", "en": " 但是史匹哲實際上知道答案 如果我們可以羽化邊緣，使邊緣變得柔和 我們就可以控制衍射 那樣我們就可以看見行星 在最近十年我們想出了 最好的解決辦法"}, {"zh-tw": " It looks something like that. We call that our flower petal starshade.", "en": " 看起來像那樣的東西 我們稱之為花瓣形遮星板"}, {"zh-tw": " If we make the edges of those petals exactly right, if we control their shape, we can control diffraction, and now we have a great shadow. It's about 10 billion times dimmer than it was before, and we can see the planets beam out just like that.", "en": " 如果我們把花瓣的邊緣設計得剛剛好 如果我們可以控制它們的形狀 我們就可以控制衍射 這樣我們就可以有一個非常好的影子 比以前的要暗約一百億倍 我們就可以像這樣看見行星"}, {"zh-tw": " That, of course, has to be bigger than my thumb. That starshade is about the size of half a football field and it has to fly 50,000 kilometersaway from the telescope that has to be held right in its shadow, and then we can see those planets.", "en": " 那個，當然要比我的大拇指要大 那個遮星板大概 和半個足球場差不多大 而且它必須飛離望遠鏡五萬公里 望遠鏡必須在影子裡放對位置 這樣我們就可以看見行星"}, {"zh-tw": " This sounds formidable, but brilliant engineers, colleagues of mine at JPL, came up with a fabulous design for how to do that and it looks like this. It starts wrapped around a hub.", "en": " 這聽起來很艱巨 但是聰明的工程師 --我在噴氣推進實驗室的同事們 想出了極好的設計 看起來像這個 它先是包裹著中心軸"}, {"zh-tw": " It separates from the telescope. The petals unfurl, they open up, the telescope turns around.", "en": " 它和望遠鏡分離 花瓣張開，打開 望遠鏡掉頭"}, {"zh-tw": " Then you'll see it flip and fly out that 50,000 kilometers away from the telescope. It's going to move in front of the star just like that, creates a wonderful shadow.", "en": " 接著它就翻轉飛離 離開望遠鏡五萬公里 它會停在恆星前面 就像那樣，製造一個完美的影子"}, {"zh-tw": " Boom, we get planets orbiting about it. Thank you.", "en": " 我們就得到了環繞的行星 （鼓掌） 謝謝"}, {"zh-tw": " That's not science fiction. We've been working on thisfor the last five or six years.", "en": " 這不是科幻 我們最近五六年致力於此"}, {"zh-tw": " Last summer, we did a really cool test out in California at Northrop Grumman. So those are four petals.", "en": " 去年夏天，在加利福尼亞的諾斯洛普·格魯門 我們進行了一個有意思的測試 這就是四片花瓣"}, {"zh-tw": " This is a sub-scale star shade. It's about half the size of the one you just saw.", "en": " 這是一個縮小的遮星板 大概是剛才你看到的那個的一半大"}, {"zh-tw": " You'll see the petals unfurl. Those four petals were built by four undergraduates doing a summer internship at JPL.", "en": " 你會看到花瓣展開 這四片花瓣是四個大學生 在我們實驗室做暑假實習生的時候做的"}, {"zh-tw": " Now you're seeing it deploy. Those petals have to rotate into place.", "en": " 現在你看到的是它的部署 這些花瓣必須必須旋轉到位"}, {"zh-tw": " The base of those petals has to go to the same place every time to within a tenth of a millimeter. We ran this test 16 times, and 16 times it went into the exact same place to a tenth of a millimeter.", "en": " 花瓣的底部 每次必須到達相同的位置 誤差在十分之一毫米以內 我們測試了16次 16次全部到達了相同位置 在十分之一毫米以內"}, {"zh-tw": " This has to be done very precisely, but if we can do this, if we can build this technology, if we can get it into space, you might see something like this. That's a picture of one our nearest neighbor stars taken with the Hubble Space Telescope.", "en": " 這個必須非常精準 如果我們可以這麼做如果我們可以實現這個技術 如果我們可以把它發射到太空， 你將會看到這樣的東西 這是離我們最近的恆星 由哈勃太空望遠鏡拍攝"}, {"zh-tw": " If we can take a similar space telescope, slightly larger, put it out there, fly an occulter in front of it, what we might see is something like that -- that's a family portrait of oursolar system -- but not ours. We're hoping it'll be someone else's solar system as seen through an occulter, through a starshade like that.", "en": " 如果我們可以用一個相似的望遠鏡 稍微大一些的 放在那裡 放飛一個遮光體在它前面， 我們可能會看到類似這樣的東西 這是我們太陽系的全家福 但是我們希望看到的是其他人的太陽系 通過遮光體 通過這樣的遮星板"}, {"zh-tw": " You can see Jupiter, you can see Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and right there in the center, next to the residual light is that pale blue dot. That's Earth. We want to see that, see if there's water, oxygen, ozone, the things that might tell us that it could harbor life.", "en": " 你可以看見木星，土星 天王星，海王星 就在中間緊靠著殘餘的光 是那個暗淡的藍點。那就是地球。 我們想要看見那個，想要看那裡有沒有水 氧氣，臭氧層 這些可以告訴我們那裡是否可以孕育生命"}, {"zh-tw": " I think this is the coolest possible science. That's why I got into doing this, because I think that will change the world.", "en": " 我認為這是最酷的可行的科學 這就是我為什麼做這個的原因 因為我認為這將改變世界"}, {"zh-tw": " That will change everything when we see that. Thank you.", "en": " 這將要改變我們看到的一切 謝謝 （鼓掌）"}], "title": "Jeremy Kasdin The Flower Shaped Starshade That Might Help Us Detect Earth Like Planets"}
