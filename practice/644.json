Because of some of technologies we've been talking about.", "en": " 很顯然地，我們現在的生活處處充滿危機 我們不但對金融體系失去信心 連對援助系統也是。 即使如此，我還是樂觀地認為 再也沒有比現在更令人興奮的時刻了。 想想現在我們所談論的科技"}, {"zh-tw": " Because of the resources, the skills, and certainly the surge of talent we're seeing all around the world, with the mindset to create change. And we've got a president who sees himself as a global citizen, who recognizes that no longer is there a single superpower, but that we've got to engage in a different way with the world.", "en": " 想想我們有的這些資源，技能 當然還有來自世界各地，不斷湧現的各式各樣的人才 和他們那顆勇於突破現狀的決心。 我們還有個自許為世界公民的總統 他不只體認到單一強權的時代已不復存在 和世界溝通的方式也必須改變。"}, {"zh-tw": " And by definition, every one of you who is in this room must consider yourself a global soul, a global citizen. You work on the front lines. And you've seen the best and the worst that human beings can do for one another and to one another.", "en": " 因此，在此的每一個人 一定要把自己當做全球的一份子 視自己為世界的公民。 你們都是第一線的工作者，看盡了人性中 最美好和最悲慘的事。"}, {"zh-tw": " And no matter what country you live or work in, you've also seen the extraordinary things that individuals are capable of, even in their most ordinariness. Today there is a raging debate as to how best we lift people out of poverty, how best we release their energies.", "en": " 不論你們在哪一個國家工作或是生活 你們都應該見識過，即使在最平凡的人身上 也有成就不平凡事業的可能。 今時今日一個關於如何消弭貧窮的議題 正被激烈的討論著 究竟我們該如何幫助窮人發揮他們的潛能。"}, {"zh-tw": " On the one hand, we have people that say the aid system is so broken we need to throw it out. And on the other we have people who say the problem is that we need more aid.", "en": " 一方面，有人認為 援助系統瀕臨崩潰，應該要放棄。 另一方面，也有人認為 還需要更多的援助。"}, {"zh-tw": " And what I want to talk about is something that compliments both systems. We call it patient capital.", "en": " 在這裡我想談的是一種能讓雙方都接受的方法 我們稱之為＂耐心資本＂。"}, {"zh-tw": " The critics point to the 500 billion dollars spent in Africa since 1970 and say, and what do we have but environmental degradation and incredible levels of poverty, rampant corruption? They use Mobutu as metaphor. And their policy prescription is to make government more accountable, focus on the capital markets, invest, don't give anything away.", "en": " 有批評指出，從1970年開始， 算算已有5000億資金投入非洲 結果呢？只造成當地環境惡化 令人難以置信的貧困，和貪汙腐敗嗎？ 他們拿蒙博托（剛果的獨裁者）做例子。 認為增強政府公信力 是最好的解決方法。 然後只把錢投資在資本市場 純粹投資，而不做任何捐助。"}, {"zh-tw": " On the other side, as I said, there are those who say the problem is that we need more money. That when it comes to the rich, we'll bail out and we'll hand a lot of aid, but when it comes to our poor brethren, we want little to do with it.", "en": " 另一邊呢？像我之前提的，有人認為 問題在於我們投入援助的錢還不夠。 當服務的對象是有錢人時， 大家很樂意錦上添花，加碼提供贊助。 但當談到這些窮人時 願意雪中送炭的人就非常有限。"}, {"zh-tw": " They point to the successes of aid: the eradication of smallpox, and the distribution of tens of millions of malaria bed nets and antiretrovirals. Both sides are right.", "en": " 他們提到一個援助的成功案例： 天花的消滅 還有透過運送數以千萬的 蚊帳及藥物才得到根除的瘧疾。 雙方說法都對"}, {"zh-tw": " And the problem is that neither side is listening to the other. Even more problematic, they're not listening to poor people themselves.", "en": " 但問題在於雙方都各持己見 更糟的是，根本沒人去了解 窮人的心聲。"}, {"zh-tw": " After 25 years of working on issues of poverty and innovation, it's true that there are probably no more market-oriented individuals on the planet than low-income people. They must navigate markets daily, making micro-decisions, dozens and dozens, to move their way through society, and yet if a single catastrophic health problem impacts their family, they could be put back into poverty, sometimes for generations.", "en": " 25年來我一直專注於 貧窮和創新的問題上 這是個事實：沒有任何人 會比低收入的窮人 更受市場影響。 他們每天被迫跟著市場環境 為生活中的細節，做出一個又一個的決定 好讓日子能過下去。 如果出現一個災難性的健康問題 降臨到他們的家庭 可能令好幾世代就此又陷入貧窮。"}, {"zh-tw": " And so we need both the market and we need aid. Patient capital works between, and tries to take the best of both.", "en": " 所以我們需要資本市場 援助系統也不能少。 耐心資本剛好在中間 企圖擷取兩邊的優點。"}, {"zh-tw": " It's money that's invested in entrepreneurs who know their communities and are building solutions to healthcare, water, housing, alternative energy, thinking of low income people not as passive recipients of charity, but as individual customers, consumers, clients, people who want to make decisions in their own lives. Patient capital requires that we have incredible tolerance for risk, a long time horizon in terms of allowing those entrepreneurs time to experiment, to use the market as the best listening device that we have, and the expectation of below-market returns, but outsized social impact.", "en": " 這資本用來投資熟知當地環境的創業家， 使他們進而提出解決方案 致力於改善醫療品質，提昇水質及住房環境，以及能源替代方案等 我們不該把窮人想成是只會被動地接受援助 而是和一般獨立個體，消費者及客戶一樣 該是掌控自己的命運的人。 耐心資本需要的是 能高度承受風險 並且給這些創業家們足夠的時間 實踐他們的計劃 而且願意傾聽市場的聲音 期待的並非是高額的投資回報 而是擴大對社會的影響。"}, {"zh-tw": " It recognizes that the market has its limitation, and so patient capital also works with smart subsidy to extend the benefits of a global economy to include all people. Now, entrepreneurs need patient capital for three reasons.", "en": " 意識到市場的侷限性， 所以耐心資本也藉由更有效的補貼方案 擴大對全球經濟的效益 影響層面將擴及所有的人。 基於三個原因 創業家需要耐心資本。"}, {"zh-tw": " First, they tend to work in markets where people make one, two, three dollars a day and they are making all of their decisions within that income level. Second, the geographies in which they work have terrible infrastructure -- no roads to speak of, sporadic electricity and high levels of corruption.", "en": " 第一，他們所運作的市場 人們每天收入不到3美元 所有生活中的決定受限於這微薄收入。 第二，他們所在的地理環境 基礎建設嚴重缺乏 沒有可辨認的道路，也稱不上有電力系統 貪汙腐敗更是猖獗。"}, {"zh-tw": " Third, they are often creating markets. Even if you're bringing clean water for the first time into rural villages, it is something new.", "en": " 第三，那是個待創造開發的市場 像乾淨的水這麽平凡的東西 在偏僻村落，都還是前所未見的商品。"}, {"zh-tw": " And so many low-income people have seen so many failed promises broken and seen so many quacks and sporadic medicines offered to them that building trust takes a lot of time, takes a lot of patience. It also requires being connected to a lot of management assistance.", "en": " 這些人 經歷過很多次＂狼來了＂ 也接受過許多庸醫的治療和零星藥品的援助 所以要取得他們的信任需要很長的時間 很多的耐心。 後續的支援管理也很重要。"}, {"zh-tw": " Not only to build the systems, the business models that allow us to reach low income people in a sustainable way, but to connect those business to other markets, to governments, to corporations -- real partnerships if we want to get to scale. I want to share one story about an innovation called drip irrigation.", "en": " 不是只有初期的系統架構 建立能深入窮人生活 和長久持續的商業模式， 還要進一步幫他們創造 能與其他市場，政府機關，公司團體相互連結的環境 唯有如此，才能達到我們預期的目標。 在這，我想和大家分享一個案例 關於一個＂滴水灌概＂的創新計劃。"}, {"zh-tw": " In 2002 I met this incredible entrepreneur named Amitabha Sadangi from India, who'd been working for 20 years with some of the poorest farmers on the planet. And he was expressing his frustration that the aid market had bypassed low-income farmers altogether, despite the fact that 200 million farmers alone in India make under a dollar a day.", "en": " 2002時我遇見這個了不起的創業家 Amitabha Sadangi, 印度人 20年來他一直致力於幫助世界上最貧困的農民 他不斷向我表達他的沮喪 因為援助系統早已忘了這群窮苦的人 事實上，光在印度就有2億的農民 每天只靠1美元過活。"}, {"zh-tw": " They were creating subsidies either for large farms, or they were giving inputs to the farmers that they thought they should use, rather than that the farmers wanted to use. At the same time Amitabha was obsessed with this drip irrigation technology that had been invented in Israel.", "en": " 有一些補助金額 除了給大的農場使用 也直接給這些農民們 並規定這些農民該如何使用補助款 而沒有詢問農民們想怎麽用。 同時Amitabha 對來自以色列的＂滴水灌溉＂技術 相當感興趣。"}, {"zh-tw": " It was a way of bringing small amounts of water directly to the stalk of the plant. And it could transform swaths of desert land into fields of emerald green.", "en": " 它將少量的水 直接灌溉在植物的根莖部 而且它可以 把連綿的沙漠荒地變成滿地翠綠。"}, {"zh-tw": " But the market also had bypassed low income farmers, because these systems were both too expensive, and they were constructed for fields that were too large. The average small village farmer works on two acres or less.", "en": " 但這技術仍舊幫不上貧苦農夫的忙。 因為相關設施非常昂貴 土地面積要達到相當的規模才適用。 而這些村落的農夫 所耕種的土地面積也不過就一二畝罷了。"}, {"zh-tw": " And so, Amitabha decided that he would take that innovation and he would redesign it from the perspective of the poor farmers themselves, because he spent so many years listening to what they needed not what he thought that they should have. And he used three fundamental principles.", "en": " 所以Amitabha決定 改造這個創新技術 重新設計一個符合這些農夫需求的灌溉系統。 他花了很多年，了解他們真正所需 而非憑自己一廂情願的想法 同時設定三個基本原則"}, {"zh-tw": " The first one was miniaturization. The drip irrigation system had to be small enough that a farmer only had to risk a quarter acre, even if he had two, because it was too frightening, given all that he had at stake.", "en": " 第一，小型化 縮小滴水灌溉系統 要小到讓這些農民只需 使用1/4畝的土地去試 即使他有二畝地 如果必須使用所有的地，對農民來說風險太大了。"}, {"zh-tw": " Second, it had to be extremely affordable. In other words, that risk on the quarter acre needed to be repaid in a single harvest, or else they wouldn't take the risk.", "en": " 第二，要農民負擔得起 也就是說，如果不幸失敗 只需一季收成就能回補損失 否則沒人會願意冒險的。"}, {"zh-tw": " And third, it had to be what Amitabha calls infinitely expandable. What I mean is with the profits from the first quarter acre, the farmers could buy a second and a third and a fourth.", "en": " 第三，Amitabha認為 要能無限擴展 意思是由第一個1/4畝地所賺到的利潤 能夠再買第二套設備 甚至第三套，第四套...."}, {"zh-tw": " As of today, IDE India, Amitabha's organization, has sold over 300,000 farmers these systems and has seen their yields and incomes double or triple on average, but this didn't happen overnight. In fact, when you go back to the beginning, there were no private investors who would be willing to take a risk on building a new technology for a market class that made under a dollar a day, that were known to be some of the most risk-averse people on the planet and that were working in one of the riskiest sectors, agriculture.", "en": " 直至今日，Amitabha成立的組織IDE 已售出30萬套這種系統 而且這些農民的收益報酬 都達以往的2倍，甚至3倍。 當然，這些成功並非一夕之間發生 事實上，一開始時 沒有任何一個私人投資者 願意冒風險投資在 日收入只有一美元的市場 而且這市場充斥著對風險亳無招架之力的一群人 更何況農業投資的風險本身已很高。"}, {"zh-tw": " And so we needed grants. And he used significant grants to research, to experiment, to fail, to innovate and try again. And when he had a prototype and had a better understanding of how to market to farmers, that's when patient capital could come in.", "en": " 所以我們需要資金，讓他可以利用大量資金 從事研究，做實驗，歷經失敗 並且再接再厲。 一旦具體計劃成形 對於如何將系統賣給農民有好的方法時 也就是耐心資本投入的時點"}, {"zh-tw": " And we helped him build a company, for profit, that would build on IDE's knowledge, and start looking at sales and exports, and be able to tap into other kinds of capital. Secondarily, we wanted to see if we could export this drip irrigation and bring it into other countries.", "en": " 這時我們幫助他成立公司，不但以獲利為目標 也藉由IDE的專業 尋求擴大營業規摸並增加產品出口的機會 進而引進其他資金管道。 第二，我們也計劃 將滴水灌溉系統出口至其他國家。"}, {"zh-tw": " And so we met Dr. Sono Khangharani in Pakistan. And while, again, you needed patience to move a technology for the poor in India into Pakistan, just to get the permits, over time we were able to start a company with Dr. Sono, who runs a large community development organization in the Thar Desert, which is one of the remote and poorest areas of the country.", "en": " 所以我們也拜訪了巴基斯坦的Sono Khangharani 博士 一段時間後，同樣地，藉由耐心資本投入 我們有機會將這新技術 由印度引進巴基斯坦 只要取得許可 經過一段時間規劃 我們得以和在塔爾沙漠 這個印度最偏僻最貧困的地區之一 擁有大型社區發展組織的Sono博士共同成立公司。"}, {"zh-tw": " And though that company has just started, our assumption is that there too we'll see the impact on millions. But drip irrigation isn't the only innovation.", "en": " 雖然公司才剛成立 但我們預測 它能影響千萬的窮苦人民。 滴水灌溉並非唯一的創新發明"}, {"zh-tw": " We're starting to see these happening all around the world. In Arusha, Tanzania, A to Z Textile Manufacturing has worked in partnership with us, with UNICEF, with the Global Fund, to create a factory that now employs 7,000 people, mostly women.", "en": " 後續效應不斷在全世界被擴散蔓延。 在坦桑尼亞的阿魯沙，A to Z 紡織廠 也和我們一起 連同聯合國兒童基金會以及全球基金 創造了一個僱用7000名員工的工廠，而且大多是女性員工"}, {"zh-tw": " And they produce 20 million lifesaving bednets for Africans around the world. Lifespring Hospital is a joint venture between Acumen and the government of India to bring quality, affordable maternal health care to low-income women, and it's been so successful that it's currently building a new hospital every 35 days.", "en": " 每年生產2千萬個防瘧疾的蚊帳 給全世界的非洲人民。 源泉醫院 由Acumen基金和印度政府合資成立 目的是提供給低收入的產婦 有品質，又能負擔得起的醫療照顧。 這醫院做得非當成功 平均每35天蓋一家新醫院。"}, {"zh-tw": " And 1298 Ambulances decided that it was going to reinvent a completely broken industry, building an ambulance service in Bombay that would use the technology of Google Earth, a sliding scale pricing system so that all people could have access, and a severe and public decision not to engage in any form of corruption. So that in the terrorist attacks of November they were the first responder, and are now beginning to scale, because of partnership.", "en": " \"1298 救護車\" 也計劃 在這個瀕臨破產的行業重新投入資金 他們在孟買設立救護車服務 利用Google Earth技術 和彈性的訂價系統 使所有人都能使用這項服務 而且所有決策採嚴謹公開的過程 杜絕任何貪瀆行為。 所以在去年11月孟買發生恐佈攻擊時 \"1298救護車\"是最先抵達災難現場的 之後隨著新伙伴加入，逐步擴大規模。"}, {"zh-tw": " They've just won four government contracts to build off their 100 ambulances, and are one of the largest and most effective ambulance companies in India. This idea of scale is critical.", "en": " 他們才剛接受4個政府委託，建造100輛救護車的合約 現在已然成為印度最具規模 最有效率的救護車公司之一。 擴大規模的想法非常重要"}, {"zh-tw": " Because we're starting to see these enterprises reach hundreds of thousands of people. All of the ones I discussed have reached at least a quarter million people. But that's obviously not enough.", "en": " 這些公司都有 成千上百的員工，而我所提及的這些公司的員工總數 超過二十五萬人。 但這顯然不夠"}, {"zh-tw": " And it's where the idea of partnership becomes so important. Whether it's by finding those innovations that can access the capital markets, government itself, or partner with major corporations, there is unbelievable opportunity for innovation.", "en": " 所以藉由合作，結合外界資源 變得十分重要。 如果這些創新技術 能由資本市場取得資金 或和政府，大企業合作 未來都能創造無限的可能。"}, {"zh-tw": " President Obama understands that. He recently authorized the creation of a Social Innovation Fund to focus on what works in this country, and look at how we can scale it.", "en": " 歐巴馬總統明白這個道理 最近他授權創立了\"社會創新基金\" 除了著眼於增進人民福址 也追求世界福址。"}, {"zh-tw": " And I would submit that it's time to consider a global innovation fund that would find these entrepreneurs around the world who really have innovations, not only for their country, but ones that we can use in the developed world as well. Invest financial assistance, but also management assistance.", "en": " 我認為現在是 推廣\"全球創新基金\"的好時機 去資助這些散佈在全球的創業家 擁有對自己國家有貢獻的創新科技 若能藉由財務支援，甚至提供管理系統協助 就能將這些創新科技推廣至世界各地"}, {"zh-tw": " And then measure the returns, both from a financial perspective and from a social impact perspective. When we think about new approaches to aid, it's impossible not to talk about Pakistan.", "en": " 那麼不只在財務方面 甚至是社會影響力層面 都能獲得可觀報酬。 當我們談到新的援助方法時 不可能不提到巴基斯坦。"}, {"zh-tw": " We've had a rocky relationship with that country and, in all fairness, the United States has not always been a very reliable partner. But again I would say that this is our moment for extraordinary things to happen.", "en": " 巴基斯坦和美國關係一直不太穩定 事實上 美國稱不上是個可以信賴的伙伴。 但是我想再一次強調 現在是個非常時刻。"}, {"zh-tw": " And if we take that notion of a global innovation fund, we could use this time to invest not directly in government, though we would have government's blessing, nor in international experts, but in the many existing entrepreneurs and civil society leaders who already are building wonderful innovations that are reaching people all across the country. People like Rashani Zafar, who created one of the largest microfinance banks in the country, and is a real role model for women inside and outside the country.", "en": " 如果我們利用全球創新基金的概念 不是直接投資政府 雖然這麼做會少了當地政府的庇佑 也不是投資於國際貿易 而是投資現成的創業家 或社會各階層領導者 這些人有很棒的創新 而且能造福全國的人。 例如Rashnai Zafar 創辦世界上最大的小額信貸銀行 也給全球女性樹立一個最好的榜樣"}, {"zh-tw": " And Tasneem Siddiqui, who developed a way called incremental housing, where he has moved 40,000 slum dwellers into safe, affordable community housing. Educational initiatives like DIL and The Citizen Foundation that are building schools across the country.", "en": " 還有Tasneem Siddiqui 提出\"增量住房\"概念 同時他成功地讓4萬個貧民窟的居民 擁有安全，且負擔得起的住家。 還有教育倡導者像是DIL以及公民基金會 他們在全國各地創辦學校"}, {"zh-tw": " It's not hyperbole to say that these civil society institutions and these social entrepreneurs are building real alternatives to the Taliban. I've invested in Pakistan for over seven years now, and those of you who've also worked there can attest that Pakistanis are an incredibly hard working population, and there is a fierce upward mobility in their very nature.", "en": " 一點也不誇張的說 這些公民社會組織 以及社會創業家 為當地人提供了塔利班以外的選擇。 我投資巴基斯坦已超過7年 你們之中如果有人在那工作過 都可以證明巴基斯坦人工作是非常認真的。 積極向上是他們的天性"}, {"zh-tw": " President Kennedy said that those who make peaceful revolution impossible make violent revolution inevitable. I would say that the converse is true.", "en": " 甘乃迪總統曾說過 那些阻止和平改革發生的人 往往促成暴力革命發生。 我覺得這句話反過來說也很有道理"}, {"zh-tw": " That these social leaders who really are looking at innovation and extending opportunity to the 70 percent of Pakistanis who make less than two dollars a day, provide real pathways to hope. And as we think about how we construct aid for Pakistan, while we need to strengthen the judiciary, build greater stability, we also need to think about lifting those leaders who can be role models for the rest of the world.", "en": " 這些社會領導者 創新求變 開拓機會 讓大部份收入微薄的巴基斯坦人 對未來燃起了新的希望。 當我們為巴基斯坦建造援助系統的同時 我們還需要藉助司法力量 建立穩固的體系 同時這些領導者 也可以將其影響力擴及世界其他地區。"}, {"zh-tw": " On one of my last visits to Pakistan, I asked Dr. Sono if he would take me to see some of the drip irrigation in the Thar Desert. And we left Karachi one morning before dawn.", "en": " 有次我去巴基斯坦時 要求Sono醫生帶我去塔爾沙漠 我想看看滴水灌溉設備在那使用的狀況 天沒亮我們由Karachi出發"}, {"zh-tw": " It was about 115 degrees.

And as we got closer, its significance became apparent.", "en": " 最後終於抵達目的地 遠遠望去，我看到一條細小的黃線 靠近時才發現"}, {"zh-tw": " That there in the desert was a field of sunflowers growing seven feet tall. Because one of the poorest farmers on Earth had gotten access to a technology that had allowed him to change his own life.", "en": " 原來在這沙漠裡 竟有一整片7呎高的向日葵 這令人驚豔的沙漠綠洲來自一個貧苦的農民 藉由科技的幫助 讓他的生活從此得到改善"}, {"zh-tw": " His name was Raja, and he had kind, twinkly hazel eyes and warm expressive hands that reminded me of my father.

Because I don't want them discriminated against anymore.\" When we think about solutions to poverty, we cannot deny individuals their fundamental dignity.", "en": " 他回答說＂當然 因為我不希望他們任何一個再受到歧視＂ 當我們思考著如何擺脫貧窮時 我們不能忽略 個人的基本尊嚴。"}, {"zh-tw": " Because at the end of the day, dignity is more important to the human spirit than wealth. And what's exciting is to see so many entrepreneurs across sectors who are building innovations that recognize that what people want is freedom and choice and opportunity.", "en": " 終究到了最後 人的尊嚴還是勝過所擁有的財富。 令人興奮的是這麼多的創業家 致力於突破創新，是因為他們了解到 人們對自由的渴望 對選擇及機會的渴求。"}, {"zh-tw": " Because that is where dignity really starts. Martin Luther King said that love without power is anemic and sentimental, and that power without love is reckless and abusive.", "en": " 這些都是人的基本尊嚴的要求。 馬丁路德曾經說過 失去力量的愛，脆弱無力，容易生悲 而失去愛的力量 則顯得蠻橫無忌。"}, {"zh-tw": " Our generation has seen both approaches tried, and often fail.
