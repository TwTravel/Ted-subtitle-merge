This is actually quite meaningful to me, because car designers tend to be a little bit low on the totem pole -- we don't do coffee table books with just one lamp inside of it -- and cars are thought so much as a product that it's a little bit difficult to get into the aesthetic side under the same sort of terminology that one would discuss art.", "en": " 作為背景介紹 我想談一下 汽車是藝術的概念 這對我意義相當大 因為汽車設計師的階級有點低 我們不設計咖啡桌邊書 裡頭只裝一個燈泡 人們過於把汽車看成產品 以致不太容易進入美學世界 放在討論藝術的範疇裡"}, {"zh-tw": " And so cars, as art, brings it into an emotional plane -- if you accept that -- that you have to deal with on the same level you would with art with a capital A. Now at this point you're going to see a picture of Michelangelo.", "en": " 如果你認同 汽車身為藝術 把事情提升到情感的層次　就像你對待藝術一樣 你將看到米開朗基羅的圖片"}, {"zh-tw": " This is completely different than automobiles. Automobiles are self-moving things, right? Elevators are automobiles.", "en": " 這跟汽車完全不同 汽車是自動的對吧？電梯也算汽車"}, {"zh-tw": " And they're not very emotional; they solve a purpose; and certainly automobiles have been around for 100 years and have made our lives functionally a lot better in many ways; they've also been a real pain in the ass, because automobiles are really the thing we have to solve. We have to solve the pollution, we have to solve the congestion -- but that's not what interests me in this speech.", "en": " 不帶情感 只解決問題 汽車有百年的歷史 大幅改善許多生活的實用面 但也令人討厭 因為汽車才是我們得解決的問題 要解決污染和交通阻塞 但以上不是我想演講的"}, {"zh-tw": " What interests me in this speech is cars. Automobiles may be what you use, but cars are what we are, in many ways. And as long as we can solve the problems of automobiles, and I believe we can, with fuel cells or hydrogen, like BMW is really hip on, and lots of other things, then I think we can look past that and try and understand why this hook is in many of us -- of this car-y-ness -- and what that means, what we can learn from it.", "en": " 我想講的是車子本身　也許汽車是你的工具 但在很多方面 汽車就是我們 只要能解決汽車的問題 我相信燃料電池和BMW熱衷的氫燃料做得到 然後就可以看得更遠 嘗試了解許多人心中的「車癮」 它具有的意義及教誨"}, {"zh-tw": " That's what I want to get to. Cars are not a suit of clothes; cars are an avatar. Cars are an expansion of yourself: they take your thoughts, your ideas, your emotions, and they multiply it -- your anger, whatever. It's an avatar. It's a super-waldo that you happen to be inside of, and if you feel sexy, the car is sexy. And if you're full of road rage, you've got a \"Chevy: Like a Rock,\" right?

That every car you see out there is sculpted by hand.", "en": " 這是我演講的目標 汽車不是一套衣服 汽車是個化身 是你自己的延伸 增加你的所思所想 情感 憤怒等等 反正 汽車是個化身 是你能坐進去的超級機械　你若覺得自己性感 車子就性感　你若覺得暴怒 就會像--「雪佛蘭：勢如強石」 汽車就是雕像 你可知道 街上每輛車都是用手雕塑的？"}, {"zh-tw": " Many people think, \"Well, it's computers, and it's done by machines and stuff like that.\" Well, they reproduce it, but the originals are all done by hand.

This is one substitution that I believe all of us, in design management, are guilty of.

This is 1996 we did this project. And so we sent them off with this team name, Deep Blue. Now many people know Deep Blue from IBM -- we actually stole it from them because we figured if anybody read our faxes they'd think we're talking about computers.", "en": " 與其有一批藝術家來當左右手 我們放逐有創意的設計師和工程師 去尋找美國下一代的SUV 1996年我們做這個計畫 　團隊也就用「深藍」的名字 許多人都知道IBM的深藍 我們其實偷用了這個名字 因為我們發現 因為如果有人看到傳真 會誤認為是在講電腦"}, {"zh-tw": " It turned out it was quite clever because Deep Blue, in a company like BMW, has a hook -- \"Deep Blue,\" wow, cool name.

They went other places.", "en": " 他們將會集合 比對資料　然後再分開 再會合　再一起理出定案 一整套龐大的看法，彼此的想法互不影響 但同時協力解決問題 希望他們徹底了解顧客的心 了解顧客在哪？像顧客一樣生活在美國，所以我們送工作人員出國 但卻發生不一樣的事　他們去了別的地方"}, {"zh-tw": " They disappeared, quite honestly, and all I got was postcards.

And they decided that instead of, like, having a studio, and six or seven apartments, it was cheaper to rent Elizabeth Taylor's ex-house in Malibu. And -- at least they told me it was her house, I guess it was at one time, she had a party there or something.", "en": " 我告訴自己：這將會是一輛很棒的車 他們到我想不到的地方去做調查 是吧　他們還決定與其租一個工作室 和六七間公寓 租伊麗莎白泰勒馬里布的老家還比較便宜 他們至少告訴我那是泰勒的房子 伊麗莎白曾在那辦過宴會或什麼的"}, {"zh-tw": " But anyway, this was the house, and they all lived there. Now this is 24/7 living, half-a-dozen people who'd left their -- some had left their wives behind and families behind, and they literally lived in this house for the entire six months the project was in America, but the first three months were the most intensive.", "en": " 總之 他們全都住在那裡 有些人離開自己的家 有些人離開妻子家人 他們都住那兒 在美國執行計劃的六個月期間內 前三個月最緊張"}, {"zh-tw": " And one of the young women in the project, she was a fantastic lady, she actually built her room in the bathroom.

OK? Nothing. This is all going on, and all I'm getting is postcards of these guys in Las Vegas, or whatever, saying, \"Don't worry Chris, this is really going to be good.\" OK? So my concept of what a design studio was probably -- I wasn't up to speed on where these guys were. However, the engineers back in Munich had taken on this kind of Newtonian solution, and they were trying to find how many cup holders can dance on the head of a pin, and, you know, these really serious questions that are confronting the modern consumer.", "en": " 另一方面 我完全不曉得 完全不曉得 我只收到明信片而已 來自拉斯維加斯等地方 寫著：「克里斯 不要擔心 一切都會很好」 我對設計工作室的想法 可能跟不上這群人 在慕尼黑的工程師團隊 依循牛頓式的辦法 他們研究有多少杯架 可以在針頭上跳舞　而且你知道 面對現代消費者　這些是很重要的問題"}, {"zh-tw": " And one was hoping that these two teams would get together, and this collusion of incredible creativity, under these incredible surroundings, and these incredibly stressed-out engineers, would create some incredible solutions.

And so we had our first meeting, after three months, in Tiburon, which is just up the road from here -- you know Tiburon? And the idea was after the first three months of this independent research they would present it all to Dr. Goschel -- who is now my boss, and at that time he was co-mentor on the project -- and they would present their results.", "en": " 你面臨分歧的牛頓式和跳躍式思考 對話出現又深又寬的鴻溝 兩組人無法整合在一起 三個月後我們在提布倫第一次開會 你們知道 就在這附近　提布倫 有一個想法是　前三個月的分別調查作業結束後 他們要呈報給戈雪爾博士 我現在的上司 當時計劃的顧問之一 他們要呈報調查成果"}, {"zh-tw": " We would see where we were going, we would see the first indication of what could be the successive phenomenon to the SUV in America.

So we went to Tiburon, after three months, and the team had gotten together the week before, many days ahead of time.", "en": " 我將看到許多成果 我熱切期盼著 我或許猜得出拉斯維加斯的重要 但真的不懂大峽谷有何關係 但總之所有的東西都將合而為一 我將會看到一些很棒的作品 所以三個月後我們到了提布倫 團隊在一個星期前就集合了 在開會前好幾天"}, {"zh-tw": " The engineers flew over, and designers got together with them, and they put their presentation together. Well, it turns out that the engineers hadn't done anything.", "en": " 工程師飛過來跟設計師會合 一起把簡報準備好 結果是工程師什麼也沒做"}, {"zh-tw": " And they hadn't done anything because -- kind of, like in car business, engineers are there to solve problems, and we were asking them to create a problem. And the engineers were waiting for the designers to say, \"This is the problem that we've created, now help us solve it.\" And they couldn't talk about it. So what happened was, the engineers showed up with nothing.", "en": " 沒做的原因是 在汽車工業工程師只負責解決問題 而我們卻要求他們製造問題 工程師等著設計師說： 「這裡有個問題 請協助解決」 工程師又不能說 於是 工程師兩手空空來了"}, {"zh-tw": " And the engineers told the designers, \"If you go in with all your stuff, we'll walk out, we'll walk right out of the project.\" So I didn't know any of this, and we got a presentation that had an agenda, looked like this.

You're letting me down, you're my designers, you're supposed to be the creative ones, what the hell is going on around here?\" It was probably one of my better tirades, I have some good ones, but this was probably one of my better ones. And I went into these people; how could they take BMW's money, how could they have a holiday for three months and produce nothing, nothing? Because of course they didn't tell us that they had three station wagons full of drawings, model concepts, pictures -- everything I wanted, they'd locked up in the cars, because they had shown solidarity with the engineers -- and they'd decided not to show me anything, in order to give the chance for problem solving a chance to start, because they hadn't realized, of course, that they couldn't do problem creating.
