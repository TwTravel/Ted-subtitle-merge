To me, the sky is always gray, flowers are always gray, and television is still in black and white.", "en": " 我出生就帶了一種罕見的視覺障礙 就是“全色盲” 我從未見過顏色 我不知道顏色看起來是什麼樣子 因為我眼見的世界都是灰色 對我來說，天空總是灰色的 鮮花總是灰色的 電視還停留在黑白時期"}, {"zh-tw": " But, since the age of 21, instead of seeing color, I can hear color. In 2003, I started a project with computer scientist Adam Montandon, and the result, with further collaborations with Peter Kese from Slovenia and Matias Lizana from Barcelona, is this electronic eye.", "en": " 不過，從21歲開始 雖還是無法看到顏色，我卻能聽到顏色 我從2003年開始了一個專案 與電腦科學家Adam Montandon合作 也因此更進一步 與斯洛維尼亞的Peter Kese 以及巴賽隆納的Matias Lizana合作 完成了這個電子眼"}, {"zh-tw": " It's a color sensor that detects the color frequency in front of me — (Frequency sounds) — and sends this frequency to a chip installed at the back of my head, and I hear the color in front of me through the bone, through bone conduction. (Frequency sounds) So, for example, if I have, like — This is the sound of purple. (Frequency sounds) For example, this is the sound of grass. (Frequency sounds) This is red, like TED. (Frequency sounds) This is the sound of a dirty sock.", "en": " 這是一個色彩感應器 探測我面前的顏色頻率（頻率音） 然後將這個頻率 傳送到頭後方安裝的晶片裡 然後通過骨傳導聽見這個色彩的頻率 （頻率音）比如說，這個 是紫色的聲音（頻率音） 再比如，這是草的聲音（頻率音） 這是紅色，像TED一樣（頻率音） 這是髒襪子的聲音"}, {"zh-tw": " Which is like yellow, this one. So I've been hearing color all the time for eight years, since 2004, so I find it completely normal now to hear color all the time.", "en": " 這個就像是黃色 我在過去8年時間裡不斷地聽見色彩 從2004年到現在，所以我已非常習慣 無時無刻聽見各種色彩"}, {"zh-tw": " At the start, though, I had to memorize the names you give for each color, so I had to memorize the notes, but after some time, all this information became a perception. I didn't have to think about the notes.", "en": " 一開始，我必須去記住各種顏色的名稱 記住各種音高 但一段時間之後，所有這些資訊 變成了一種感知 我不必刻意去想這是什麼音高"}, {"zh-tw": " And after some time, this perception became a feeling. I started to have favorite colors, and I started to dream in colors.", "en": " 又過了一段時間，這種感知變成了一種感覺 我有了自己最喜歡的顏色 我開始做有顏色的夢"}, {"zh-tw": " So, when I started to dream in color is when I felt that the software and my brain had united, because in my dreams, it was my brain creating electronic sounds. It wasn't the software, so that's when I started to feel like a cyborg. It's when I started to feel that the cybernetic device was no longer a device.", "en": " 當我開始做有顏色的夢 我感覺軟體和大腦已然合而為一 因為在夢裡 電子音是由大腦，而不是軟體發出的 那時我覺得自己是個半機械人 我開始覺得神經機械裝置 並不僅僅是一個裝置"}, {"zh-tw": " It had become a part of my body, an extension of my senses, and after some time, it even became a part of my official image. This is my passport from 2004.", "en": " 它已經成為我身體的一部分 感官的延伸 不久後，它甚至成為 我正式形象的一部分 這是我2004年以後的護照"}, {"zh-tw": " You're not allowed to appear on U.K. passports with electronic equipment, but I insisted to the passport office that what they were seeing was actually a new part of my body, an extension of my brain, and they finally accepted me to appear with the passport photo. So, life has changed dramatically since I hear color, because color is almost everywhere, so the biggest change for example is going to an art gallery, I can listen to a Picasso, for example. So it's like I'm going to a concert hall, because I can listen to the paintings.", "en": " 英國護照上不允許出現電子設備 但我堅持跟官員說 他們看到的 是我身體的一個新的部分 我大腦的延伸 他們最終接受我用這種護照照片 我的人生從能聽見色彩的那一刻發生了劇變 色彩無處不在 最大的改變發生在 去美術館，聆聽畢卡索 就像是去音樂廳 我可以聽到那些畫"}, {"zh-tw": " And supermarkets, I find this is very shocking, it's very, very attractive to walk along a supermarket. It's like going to a nightclub.", "en": " 超市更是驚人 逛超市變成一項超級吸引人的事 就像去夜店一樣"}, {"zh-tw": " It's full of different melodies.  Yeah. Especially the aisle with cleaning products.", "en": " 各種旋律無所不包沒錯 特別是清潔用品區"}, {"zh-tw": " It's just fabulous. Also, the way I dress has changed.", "en": " 太讚了 我的穿衣方式也發生了改變"}, {"zh-tw": " Before, I used to dress in a way that it looked good. Now I dress in a way that it sounds good.", "en": " 從前，我穿好看的 現在，我穿好聽的 （鼓掌）"}, {"zh-tw": " So today I'm dressed in C major, so it's quite a happy chord. If I had to go to a funeral, though, I would dress in B minor, which would be turquoise, purple and orange.", "en": " 今天我穿的是C大調 是十分快樂的和弦 但如果我要去參加葬禮 我就會穿上b小調 也就是藍綠色、紫色和橘色"}, {"zh-tw": " Also, food, the way I look at food has changed, because now I can display the food on a plate, so I can eat my favorite song. So depending on how I display it, I can hear and I can compose music with food.", "en": " 我看待食物的方式也發生了改變 因為現在我餐盤上擺放的食物 可以讓我吃我最喜歡的歌曲 根據我擺放的方式 能夠聽見食物，用食物來作曲"}, {"zh-tw": " So imagine a restaurant where we can have, like, Lady Gaga salads as starters.  I mean, this would get teenagers to eat their vegetables, probably. And also, some Rachmaninov piano concertos as main dishes, and some Bjork or Madonna desserts, that would be a very exciting restaurant where you can actually eat songs.", "en": " 想像一下這樣一個餐館 前菜是Lady Gaga沙拉 也許這能讓青少年乖乖吃蔬菜 還有，主菜是拉赫曼尼諾夫鋼琴協奏曲 甜點是碧玉或者瑪丹娜 這餐聽一定很棒 你能真的吃得到歌曲"}, {"zh-tw": " Also, the way I perceive beauty has changed, because when I look at someone, I hear their face, so someone might look very beautiful but sound terrible. And it might happen the opposite, the other way around. So I really enjoy creating, like, sound portraits of people.", "en": " 我看待美的方式也發生了改變 因為我看某人的時候，我聽到對方臉的聲音 所以一些人也許看起來很美但聽起來很糟 另一些人也許恰好相反 我很享受的一件事 就是做出人們的聲音肖像"}, {"zh-tw": " Instead of drawing someone's face, like drawing the shape, I point at them with the eye and I write down the different notes I hear, and then I create sound portraits. Here's some faces.", "en": " 我不去畫人臉的形狀 而是用電子眼指向他們 然後寫下聽到的音符，從而做出聲音肖像 這是某些知名的臉的聲音"}, {"zh-tw": " (Musical chords) Yeah, Nicole Kidman sounds good. Some people, I would never relate, but they sound similar.", "en": " （和弦） 對啊，妮可基嫚很好聽 有些人看起來完全不像，但聽上去很相似"}, {"zh-tw": " Prince Charles has some similarities with Nicole Kidman. They have similar sound of eyes.", "en": " 比如查爾斯王子和妮可基嫚就很像 他們眼睛的頻率音很像"}, {"zh-tw": " So you relate people that you wouldn't relate, and you can actually also create concerts by looking at the audience faces. So I connect the eye, and then I play the audience's faces.", "en": " 於是你會把本無關聯的人聯繫起來 你也能開場音樂會 全憑看看觀眾的臉 我連上電子眼，然後播放觀眾臉的音樂"}, {"zh-tw": " The good thing about this is, if the concert doesn't sound good, it's their fault. It's not my fault, because — And so another thing that happens is that I started having this secondary effect that normal sounds started to become color.", "en": " 這樣做的好處是 如果音樂會很難聽，那全是觀眾的錯 與我無關，因為... 我身上發生的另一個改變是 電子眼產生的副作用 平常的聲音開始有了色彩"}, {"zh-tw": " I heard a telephone tone, and it felt green because it sounded just like the color green. The BBC beeps, they sound turquoise, and listening to Mozart became a yellow experience, so I started to paint music and paint people's voices, because people's voices have frequencies that I relate to color.", "en": " 我聽到電話鈴聲，它是綠色的 因為和綠色的頻率音聽起來一模一樣 BBC嗶嗶聲是藍綠色的 莫札特的音樂是黃色的 我畫出音樂，畫出人的嗓音 因為人的嗓音也有不同頻率 就像色彩有不同頻率"}, {"zh-tw": " And here's some music translated into color. For example, Mozart, \"Queen of the Night,\" looks like this.", "en": " 這些是音樂轉化成色彩 比如說，莫札特魔笛的“夜之皇后”，看起來是這樣"}, {"zh-tw": " (Music) Very yellow and very colorful, because there's many different frequencies. (Music) And this is a completely different song.", "en": " （音樂）鮮豔的黃色、十分多彩 因為有不同的頻率 （音樂） 這是完全不同的一首歌"}, {"zh-tw": " (Music) It's Justin Bieber's \"Baby.\" (Music) It is very pink and very yellow. So, also voices, I can transform speeches into color, for example, these are two very well-known speeches.", "en": " （音樂）小賈斯汀”Baby” （音樂） 非常的粉紅和黃色 對於嗓音，我能把演講轉化成色彩 這是兩個十分著名的演講"}, {"zh-tw": " One of them is Martin Luther King's \"I Have A Dream,\" and the other one is Hitler. And I like to exhibit these paintings in the exhibition halls without labels, and then I ask people, \"Which one do you prefer?\" And most people change their preference when I tell them that the one on the left is Hitler and the one on the right is Martin Luther King.", "en": " 一個是馬丁‧路德‧金恩的“我有個夢” 另一個是希特勒的演說 我喜歡在陳列廳裡展示這兩幅畫 不放標籤然後我會問人們 “你喜歡哪一個？” 大多數人會改變主意 一旦我告訴他們左邊的是希特勒 右邊的才是馬丁‧路德‧金恩"}, {"zh-tw": " So I got to a point when I was able to perceive 360 colors, just like human vision. I was able to differentiate all the degrees of the color wheel.", "en": " 現在我已經能夠辨認360種顏色 就像人類視覺 我可以辨認出色相環上任何角度的顏色"}, {"zh-tw": " But then, I just thought that this human vision wasn't good enough. There's many, many more colors around us that we cannot perceive, but that electronic eyes can perceive.", "en": " 但我又想 人類視覺還不夠好 有很多顏色 我們是無法看到的 但這個電子眼可以感應到"}, {"zh-tw": " So I decided to continue extending my color senses, and I added infrared and I added ultraviolet to the color-to-sound scale, so now I can hear colors that the human eye cannot perceive. For example, perceiving infrared is good because you can actually detect if there's movement detectors in a room.", "en": " 於是我決定繼續擴展我的色彩感覺 我把紅外線和紫外線 加入到這個色彩／聲音譜 就能聽見那些人眼所無法看到的顏色 感知到紅外線的好處是 你能知道房間裡有沒有運動探測儀器"}, {"zh-tw": " I can hear if someone points at me with a remote control. And the good thing about perceiving ultraviolet is that you can hear if it's a good day or a bad day to sunbathe, because ultraviolet is a dangerous color, a color that can actually kill us, so I think we should all have this wish to perceive things that we cannot perceive.", "en": " 如果有人用遙控器指著我，我能聽見 感知紫外線的好處是 你可以用聽的來判斷今天是否適合日光浴 因為紫外線是一種危險的顏色 它能致人死亡我認為我們都該希望 感知到無法感知的事物"}, {"zh-tw": " That's why, two years ago, I created the Cyborg Foundation, which is a foundation that tries to help people become a cyborg, tries to encourage people to extend their senses by using technology as part of the body. We should all think that knowledge comes from our senses, so if we extend our senses, we will consequently extend our knowledge.", "en": " 因此，兩年前 我發起了半機械人基金會 基金會幫助人們變成半機械人 鼓勵人們 拓展他們的感官 讓科技變成身體的一部分 知識來源於感知 如果我們能擴展感知 我們就能擴展我們的知識"}, {"zh-tw": " I think life will be much more exciting when we stop creating applications for mobile phones and we start creating applications for our own body. I think this will be a big, big change that we will see during this century.", "en": " 我認為生活會變得更刺激有趣 當我們停止開發手機應用程式 而開始開發人體應用程式 我認為這在本世紀 將會看到這巨大的改變"}, {"zh-tw": " So I do encourage you all to think about which senses you'd like to extend. I would encourage you to become a cyborg.", "en": " 我鼓勵你們都去想一想 自己想要擴展那個感官 我鼓勵你們成為半機械人"}, {"zh-tw": " You won't be alone. Thank you.", "en": " 你不會是孤單的。謝謝。(鼓掌) （鼓掌）"}], "title": "Neil Harbisson I Listen To Color"}
