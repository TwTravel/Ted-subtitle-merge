Their names were Aslan, Alik, Andrei, Fernanda, Fred, Galina, Gunnhild, Hans, Ingeborg, Matti, Natalya, Nancy, Sheryl, Usman, Zarema, and the list is longer.

But they are also hauntingthe dark street of my mind."}, {"zh-tw": "作為人道主義援助工作者，他們選擇站在受害者的一邊，提供力所能及的幫助、安樂、保護，但是當他們自己需要保護時，卻無法被保護。時至今日，當你在看報紙頭條，看見伊拉克、敘利亞在打仗的同時，也看到援助工作者被綁架、人質被處決，但是他們是誰？為什麼他們會在那裡？為什麼他們決定到那裡去？面對這些犯罪，我們怎麼變得如此冷漠？這就是我今天來到這裡的原因。", "en": "As humanitarian aid workers, they made the choiceto be at the side of the victim, to provide some assistance,some comfort, some protection, but when they neededprotection themselves, it wasn't there. When you see the headlinesof your newspaper these days with the war in Iraq or in Syria -- aid worker abducted, hostage executed -- but who were they? Why were they there? What motivated them? How did we becomeso indifferent to these crimes? This is why I am here today with you."}, {"zh-tw": "我們需要尋找更好的方式去銘記這些受害者。我們需要闡釋他們犧牲奉獻的關鍵理念。", "en": "We need to find better waysto remember them.

When it happens to you, there is no time for thinking,no time for praying."}, {"zh-tw": "我的大腦自動開始運作，快速回想我過去所經歷的人生。花了很長時間，我才發現這群蒙面男子不是來殺我的，但是受人指使來綁架我。", "en": "My brain went on automatic, rewinding quicklythe life I'd just left behind. It took me long minutes to figure out that those masked men therewere not there to kill me, but that someone, somewhere,had ordered my kidnapping."}, {"zh-tw": "之後，一系列泯滅人性的行為從那天開始了。我變成了一件商品。", "en": "Then a process of dehumanizationstarted that day.

But darkness also creates imagesand thoughts that are not normal."}, {"zh-tw": "大腦的一邊想讓你反抗、嘶吼、哭泣，另一邊卻命令你閉嘴，默默忍受這一切。這是無休止的內心辯論；沒有人來做最終的裁決。", "en": "One part of your brain wants youto resist, to shout, to cry, and the other part of the brainorders you to shut up and just go through it. It's a constant internal debate;there is no one to arbitrate."}, {"zh-tw": "有一次，一名看守氣勢洶洶地走過來，告訴我，「今天要吃的，你就得向我下跪乞求。」當時我的心情不好，所以就罵他。我詛咒了他媽媽、他的祖宗。", "en": "Once a guard came to me,very aggressively, and he told me, \"Today you're going to kneeland beg for your food.\" I wasn't in a good mood,so I insulted him. I insulted his mother,I insulted his ancestors."}, {"zh-tw": "結果比較溫和：他將食物扔進了裝排泄物的桶。第二天他還是同樣的要求。", "en": "The consequence was moderate:he threw the food into my waste.

Submission was the only way for meto make it to another candle."}, {"zh-tw": "被綁架之後，我從北奧賽梯，被運到車臣，漫漫的三天路程，我被困在不同的車尾箱裡，一到達，我就被審問，一個叫鲁斯兰的人，審問了我11天。審問方法總是一樣的：光明延長到45分鐘。", "en": "After my kidnapping, I was transferredfrom North Ossetia to Chechnya, three days of slow travelin the trunks of different cars, and upon arrival, I was interrogated for 11 days by a guy called Ruslan. The routine was always the same: a bit more light, 45 minutes."}, {"zh-tw": "他來到地窖，讓看守把我綁在椅子上，然後把音樂放得很大聲。然後，他大聲喊著提問。", "en": "He would come down to the cellar, he would ask the guardsto tie me on the chair, and he would turn on the music loud. And then he would yell questions."}, {"zh-tw": "他尖叫，還毆打我。細節我就不提了。", "en": "He would scream. He would beat me. I'll spare you the details."}, {"zh-tw": "審問的問題有很多我都不懂，也有一些是我不願意懂。審問的時長是帶子的時長：15首歌，45分鐘。", "en": "There are many questionsI could not understand, and there are some questionsI did not want to understand. The length of the interrogationwas the duration of the tape: 15 songs, 45 minutes."}, {"zh-tw": "我總是盼著快點播到最後一首。有一天，不知道是白天還是夜晚，我聽到頭頂有一個小孩在哭，是個小男孩，也許兩歲或者三歲。", "en": "I would always long for the last song. On one day, one night in that cellar,I don't know what it was, I heard a child crying above my head, a boy, maybe two or three years old."}, {"zh-tw": "（我聽到）腳步聲、一些混亂，還有人奔跑。鲁斯兰第二天過來，在他問第一個問題之前，我問他「你兒子今天怎樣了？他好點了嗎？」鲁斯兰吃了一驚。", "en": "Footsteps, confusion, people running. So when Ruslan came the day after, before he put the first question to me, I asked him, \"How is your son today?Is he feeling better?\" Ruslan was taken by surprise."}, {"zh-tw": "他非常生氣，以為這裡的看守把他的私人生活告訴我了。他非常生氣，以為這裡的守衛把他的私人生活告訴我了。我一直說，向本地診所提供藥物的非政府組織可能會幫他兒子恢復健康。", "en": "He was furious that the guardsmay have leaked some details about his private life. I kept talking about NGOssupplying medicines to local clinics that may help his son to get better."}, {"zh-tw": "然後我們談教育，我們談家庭。他跟我講他的孩子。", "en": "And we talked about education,we talked about families. He talked to me about his children."}, {"zh-tw": "我跟他講我的女兒。然後他要聊槍支、聊汽車、聊女人，所以我也得聊槍支、聊汽車、聊女人。", "en": "I talked to him about my daughters. And then he'd talk about guns,about cars, about women, and I had to talk about guns,about cars, about women."}, {"zh-tw": "我們一直聊到最後一首歌。鲁斯兰是我遇見過最兇殘的男人。", "en": "And we talked untilthe last song on the tape. Ruslan was the most brutal man I ever met."}, {"zh-tw": "他沒有再碰我了。他沒有再問我其他任何問題。", "en": "He did not touch me anymore. He did not ask any other questions."}, {"zh-tw": "我不再僅僅是一件商品。兩天之後，我被轉移到另一個地方。", "en": "I was no longer just a commodity. Two days after, I was transferredto another place."}, {"zh-tw": "在那裡，一名看守走到我身邊，相當靠近——平常不會這樣——他用很輕很輕的聲音說「我要感謝你，我們在達吉斯坦流離失所時，你們的組織向我家人提供了幫助。」我能說什麼？實在是太痛苦了。就像腹中插了一把刀。我花了好幾個星期去思考、嘗試重新接受從前幫助那些家庭和像他那樣後來變成僱傭軍的人時，我們深信的信念。", "en": "There, a guard came to me,very close -- it was quite unusual -- and he said witha very soft voice, he said, \"I'd like to thank you for the assistance your organizationprovided my family when we were displacedin nearby Dagestan.\" What could I possibly reply? It was so painful.It was like a blade in the belly. It took me weeks of internal thinkingto try to reconcile the good reasons we hadto assist that family and the soldier of fortune he became."}, {"zh-tw": "他年輕、羞怯。我從沒見過他的臉。", "en": "He was young, he was shy. I never saw his face."}, {"zh-tw": "他的用意可能是好的。但在那15秒裡，他讓我質疑我們以前所做的一切，所有的犧牲。", "en": "He probably meant well. But in those 15 seconds, he made me question everything we did, all the sacrifices."}, {"zh-tw": "他讓我開始思考他們對我們的看法。在此之前，我以為他們知道我們為什麼會在那裡、我們在幹什麼。", "en": "He made me think also how they see us. Until then, I had assumedthat they know why we are there and what we are doing."}, {"zh-tw": "但大家不能這樣擅自揣測。解釋我們的行動目的，並不容易，即便是對我們最親的親人。", "en": "One cannot assume this. Well, explaining why we do thisis not that easy, even to our closest relatives."}, {"zh-tw": "我們並不完美，也不高人一等，我們不是世界消防隊，也不是超級英雄，我們不能阻止戰爭，我們深知人道主義措施不能代替政治解決方案。但我們仍然堅持工作，因為每條生命都很寶貴。", "en": "We are not perfect, we are not superior, we are not the world's fire brigade, we are not superheroes, we don't stop wars, we know that humanitarian response is nota substitute for political solution. Yet we do this because one life matters."}, {"zh-tw": "有時這就是你力所能及的，一條生命、一個家庭、一個小群體，都很重要。海嘯、地震、颱風發生時，你看見救援隊伍從世界各地趕往現場，連續數週搜索倖存者。", "en": "Sometimes that's the onlydifference you make -- one individual, one family,a small group of individuals -- and it matters. When you have a tsunami,an earthquake or a typhoon, you see teams of rescuerscoming from all over the world, searching for survivors for weeks."}, {"zh-tw": "為什麼？沒有人去質疑。每條生命都很寶貴，或者說，每條生命都應該很寶貴。", "en": "Why? Nobody questions this. Every life matters, or every life should matter."}, {"zh-tw": "出於同一原因，我們幫助難民幫助由於衝突而流離失所的人，無論他們有沒有國籍。我知道有很多人，當他們面臨不能承受之苦時，會覺得無能為力，止步不前。這很遺憾，因為人們能給予幫助的方式有很多。", "en": "This is the same for uswhen we help refugees, people displaced within their countryby conflict, or stateless persons, I know many people, when they are confrontedby overwhelming suffering, they feel powerless and they stop there. It's a pity, because there areso many ways people can help."}, {"zh-tw": "我們不會因為這種無力感而止步。我們嘗試盡己所能，去提供一些幫助、保護和安樂。", "en": "We don't stop with that feeling. We try to do whatever we canto provide some assistance, some protection, some comfort."}, {"zh-tw": "我們必須這樣做。我們別無選擇。", "en": "We have to. We can't do otherwise."}, {"zh-tw": "這能讓我們感覺…感覺到簡單的人道。這是我被釋放當天的照片。", "en": "It's what makes us feel,I don't know, simply human. That's a picture of methe day of my release."}, {"zh-tw": "釋放數月後，我會見了當時的法國總理。他告訴我的第二件事是：「你去北高加索，實在是完全不負責任。", "en": "Months after my release,I met the then-French prime minister. The second thing he told me: \"You were totally irresponsibleto go to the North Caucasus."}, {"zh-tw": "你不知道你給我們帶來了多少麻煩。」會面很簡短。我相信，幫助身處危難的人是負責任的行為。", "en": "You don't know how manyproblems you've created for us.\" It was a short meeting. I think helping peoplein danger is responsible."}, {"zh-tw": "那場戰爭，沒有人想要真正停戰，今天我們有很多這樣的戰爭，為有需要的人帶去一點幫助、一點保護並不只是人道行為，這是為人類所做的真正改變。為什麼他不能理解這點？我們有責任去嘗試。", "en": "In that war, that nobodyseriously wanted to stop, and we have many of these today, bringing some assistance to people in needand a bit of protection was not just an act of humanity, it was making a real differencefor the people.

Outcomes may dependon various parameters."}, {"zh-tw": "我們甚至可能會失敗，但比失敗更糟糕的是：即便是力所能及，也不去嘗試。假如你有這樣的經歷，如果你決定加入這類工作，你的生活將會充滿快樂和悲傷，因為我們無法幫助的人有很多，我們無法保護的人有很多，我們沒能拯救的人有很多。", "en": "We may even fail,but there is worse than failing -- it's not even trying when we can.

Many young humanitarian workers go through their first experiencewith a lot of bitterness."}, {"zh-tw": "他們不得不目睹一些情景慘狀，但是他們無能為力，無法改變。他們必須學會接受，慢慢將這些轉化為正能量。", "en": "They are thrown into situationswhere they are witness, but they are powerlessto bring any change.

Many don't succeed, but for those who do,there is no other job like this."}, {"zh-tw": "每天你都可以看見自己發揮的作用。人道主義援助工作者知道他們所擔負的風險，無論在衝突地區、還是衝突過後的地區，但我們的生命、我們的工作卻越來越威脅到生命安全，而生命的聖潔性卻逐漸減退。", "en": "You can see the differenceyou make every day.
