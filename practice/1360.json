Were there subpopulations? And that's very importantif you want to know what the population size is,and the status of the animals.

So it does seem to bethat basking sharks, for some reason, have incredibly low diversity.", "en": " 於是他做了另一項研究 並使用微衛星 微衛星更貴又更費時間 最後結果卻幾乎一模一樣 所以看起來 姥鯊的基因多樣性確實極低"}, {"zh-tw": " And it's thought maybeit was a genetic bottleneck, thought to have been 12,000 years ago, and this has caused a very low diversity. And yet, if you look at the whale shark, which is the otherplankton-eating large shark, its diversity is much greater.", "en": " 也許這是一個瓶頸，一個基因上的瓶頸 可能在12,000年前 造成了非常低的多樣性 不過你看豆腐鯊 另一個以浮游生物為食的大型鯊魚 多樣性就高很多"}, {"zh-tw": " So it doesn't really make sense at all. They found that there wasno genetic differentiation between any of the world's oceansof basking sharks: even though they're foundthroughout the world, you couldn't tellthe difference, genetically, from one from the Pacific, Atlantic,New Zealand, Ireland, South Africa.", "en": " 這實在是沒道理 他們發現在世界上的姥鯊 沒有基因上的差別 即使姥鯊分布在世界各地 在基因上卻沒有差別 不管是大西洋、太平洋、紐西蘭、愛爾蘭或南非 牠們基本上都一樣"}, {"zh-tw": " They all basically seem the same. Which, again, is kind of surprising;you wouldn't expect that.", "en": " 這也是相當驚人的發現，很令人感到意外"}, {"zh-tw": " I don't understand or pretendto understand this; I suspect most geneticists don't either, but they produce the numbers. So you can actually estimatethe population size based on the diversity of the genetics.", "en": " 我不懂，也不假裝懂 我想大部份的基因學家也感到不解 不過他們會產生數據 所以你可以根據基因多樣性 推算族群的數量"}, {"zh-tw": " And Rus Hoelzel came up withan effective population size: 8,200 animals. That's it -- 8,000 animals in the world.", "en": " 羅斯荷澤計算出相當準確的數字 一共有8200隻 就這樣 世界上就只有八千隻"}, {"zh-tw": " You're thinking,\"That's ridiculous. No way.\" So Les did a finer study, and he found out it came out about 9,000. Using different microsatellitesgave the different results, but the mean of all thesestudies is about 5,000, which I personally don't believe.", "en": " 你一定會覺得「這太扯了，不可能」 不過諾柏做了更精確的研究 結果數字大概落在9000 使用不同的微衛星得到不同結果 不過所有的研究平均出來-- 平均數為5000 我個人不相信這份報告結果"}, {"zh-tw": " But then, I am a skeptic. But even if you toss a few numbers around, you're probably talking an effectivepopulation of about 20,000 animals.", "en": " 不過我這個人一向就會抱持懷疑的態度 但就算你把數字換一換 有效的族群數字也大概在20,000隻"}, {"zh-tw": " Do you remember how many they killedoff Achill in the 70s and the 50s?

Well, one obvious source is dead sharks -- dead sharks, washed up.", "en": " 他們沒有足夠的樣本 來仔細 去研究這些基因 那到底要從哪裡 去蒐集到需要的基因樣本呢？ 一個滿明顯的來源就是死掉的鯊魚 沖上岸的死鯊魚"}, {"zh-tw": " We might get two or three dead sharkswashed up in Ireland a year, if we're kind of lucky.

So by just rubbingthe mop handle down the shark as it swam under the boat -- you see a sharkrunning under the boat here -- we managed to collect slime.", "en": " 所以我們相當急迫 一聽到有鯊魚出沒就匆忙趕到布拉斯克島 找到那些鯊魚 所以我們只不過是把拖把柄 摩擦這些在船下游動的鯊魚 這邊可以看到船底下有鯊魚在那邊游 我們就成功取得黏液"}, {"zh-tw": " And here it is. Look at that lovely black shark slime.", "en": " 就是這個 非常美妙的黑色鯊魚黏液"}, {"zh-tw": " And in about half an hour,we got five samples. Five individual sharks were sampled using Simon's Shark Slime Sampling System.", "en": " 在半小時內 我們蒐集了五個樣本，五個不同鯊魚的樣本 而且是利用賽門的鯊魚黏液樣本系統"}, {"zh-tw": " I've been working on whales and dolphinsin Ireland for 20 years now, and they're a bit more dramatic. You probably sawthe humpback whale footage we got a month or two agooff County Wexford.", "en": " 我在愛爾蘭研究鯨魚和海豚已有20年之久 牠們算是比較戲劇化的種類 各位大概看過座頭鯨的精彩鏡頭 是我們一、兩個月前在韋克斯福德郡拍到的"}, {"zh-tw": " And you always thinkyou might have some legacy you can leave the world behind, and I was thinking of humpbackwhales breaching and dolphins. But hey -- sometimesthese things are sent to you and you just have to take themwhen they come.", "en": " 我們總是想在這世界上留名 而我一直在擔心這些座頭鯨 和海豚遭殺害 不過有時候就是會有一些小東西自動送上門來 你就只能乖乖接收了 這可能會是我遺留給這世界的遺產吧"}, {"zh-tw": " So this is possiblygoing to be my legacy -- Simon's Shark Slime. We got more money this year to carry on collectingmore and more samples.", "en": " 賽門的鯊魚黏液 而我們今年籌得更多資金 去蒐集更多樣本"}, {"zh-tw": " One thing that is very usefulis that we use a pole camera -- this is my colleague, Joanne,with a pole camera -- where you can look underneath the shark. What you're trying to look at is,the males have claspers, which kind of dangle outbehind the back of the shark.", "en": " 有個非常有用的東西 我們使用高竿攝影-這是我的同事裘安拿著高竿攝影機- 就可以從鯊魚下方觀察牠們 雄姥鯊有鰭腳（生殖器官） 是一個長在姥鯊背後的垂狀物"}, {"zh-tw": " So you can quite easily tellthe gender of the shark. If we can tell the gender of the sharkbefore we sample it, we can tell the geneticistthis was taken from a male or a female.", "en": " 這樣就可以輕易分辨姥鯊的性別 在取得樣本前 一旦先辨認出性別 我們就可以告訴基因學家，這樣本的雌雄"}, {"zh-tw": " Because in the moment,they have no way, genetically, of telling the differencebetween a male and a female, which I find staggering, because they don't knowwhat primers to look for. Being able to tell the gender of a shark is very importantfor things like policing the trade in basking shark and other speciesthrough the sightings, because it is illegalto trade in these sharks.", "en": " 因為目前基因學家是無法從基因中 辨認出雌雄 這是非常令人驚訝的消息 因為他們不知道要去找哪些引子 能分辨出鯊魚的性別 對立法禁止 姥鯊及其他種類的鯊魚交易 是非常重要的 因為任何鯊魚的買賣都是違法的 但市場上仍有鯊魚買賣行為"}, {"zh-tw": " And they are caught and are on the market. So as a field biologist, you just want to get encounterswith these animals, and learn as much as you can.", "en": " 所以身為田野生物學家 就是要和這些動物接觸 並盡全力研究牠們"}, {"zh-tw": " They're often quite brief,they're often very seasonally constrained. You just want to learn as muchas you can as soon as you can.", "en": " 牠們受季節影響出現時間很短 所以就更要把握機會作研究"}, {"zh-tw": " But isn't it fantastic that you can then offerthese samples and opportunities to other disciplines,such as the geneticists, who can gain so much more from that. So as I said, these thingsare sent to you in strange ways.", "en": " 這是非常美妙的事情 我們可以提供這些樣本 給基因學家等人 這些學者可以從中受益無窮 所以就像我稍早所說的 有時候機會會自動上門來，你就要把握機會"}, {"zh-tw": " Grab them while you can. I'll take that as my scientific legacy.", "en": " 我會把這個當作我的科學遺產"}, {"zh-tw": " Hopefully, I might get somethinga bit more dramatic and romantic before I die. But for the time being,thank you for that.", "en": " 不過也希望在我死前可以得到更戲劇化或更浪漫的東西 在這之前，就謝謝各位 記得多關注鯊魚"}, {"zh-tw": " And keep an eye out for sharks. If you're more interested, we havea basking shark website now set up.", "en": " 如果有興趣的話，我們也剛架了一個關於姥鯊的網站"}, {"zh-tw": " So thank you and thank you for listening.", "en": " 謝謝各位的聆聽"}], "title": "Simon Berrow How Do You Save A Shark You Know Nothing About"}
