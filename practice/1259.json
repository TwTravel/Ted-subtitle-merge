It was all due to this woman, Sister Mary Marastela, also known as my mom.", "en": " 我自己也熱衷於道德 那是由於這位女士的緣故 這位是瑪莉馬拉斯特拉修女 也叫做我媽"}, {"zh-tw": " As an altar boy, I breathed in a lot of incense, and I learned to say phrases in Latin, but I also had time to think about whether my mother's top-down morality applied to everybody. I saw that people who were religious and non-religious were equally obsessed with morality.", "en": " 當輔祭童時，我常聞焚香味 也學會了說一點拉丁語詞 但我還是有時間思考 我母親的由上而下的道德 是否適用於每一個人 我看到有宗教和無宗教信仰的人 都同樣熱衷於道德"}, {"zh-tw": " I thought, maybe there's some earthly basis for moral decisions. But I wanted to go further than to say our brains make us moral.", "en": " 我想也許在道德的決定背後 有一些世俗的基礎 但是我想更深入研究 不想只說道德來自我們的大腦"}, {"zh-tw": " I want to know if there's a chemistry of morality. I want to know if there was a moral molecule.", "en": " 我想明白道德是否有化學的基礎 我想知道 有否道德的分子存在"}, {"zh-tw": " After 10 years of experiments, I found it. Would you like to see it? I brought some with me.", "en": " 經過十年的實驗 我找到了那個分子了 要看看道德分子嗎？我帶來了一些"}, {"zh-tw": " This little syringe contains the moral molecule. It's called oxytocin.", "en": " 這個小針筒 裡頭裝的是道德分子 它叫做催產素"}, {"zh-tw": " So oxytocin is a simple and ancient molecule found only in mammals. In rodents, it was known to make mothers care for their offspring, and in some creatures, allowed for toleration of burrowmates.", "en": " 催產素是一種既簡單又古老的分子 哺乳類動物身上才找得到它 在嚙齒目動物身上 它會讓母獸照顧後代 它也會讓某些動物 能容忍別的動物同居一穴"}, {"zh-tw": " But in humans, it was only known to facilitate birth and breastfeeding in women, and is released by both sexes during sex. So I had this idea that oxytocin might be the moral molecule.", "en": " 但在人類身上，我們只知道 它會為女人催生、催乳 做愛時兩性都會釋放出催產素 因此我想到催產素可能就是道德分子"}, {"zh-tw": " I did what most of us do -- I tried it on some colleagues. One of them told me, \"Paul, that is the world's stupidist idea.", "en": " 像多數人一樣－我問了一些同事的意見 其中一位告訴我 「保羅，這是世界上最蠢的想法。」"}, {"zh-tw": " It is,\" he said, \"only a female molecule.

Turns out it wasn't so easy.", "en": " 換言之，我認為可以設計一個實驗 來看看催產素是否會讓人有道德 結果發現並沒有那麼容易"}, {"zh-tw": " First of all, oxytocin is a shy molecule. Baseline levels are near zero, without some stimulus to cause its release.", "en": " 首先，催產素是一種害羞的分子 最通常的情況是零水平 沒有受到刺激催產素不會釋放的"}, {"zh-tw": " And when it's produced, it has a three-minute half-life, and degrades rapidly at room temperature. So this experiment would have to cause a surge of oxytocin, have to grab it fast and keep it cold.", "en": " 產生後的半衰期只有三分鐘 而且在室溫下會很快衰變 因此做實驗要能引發大量催產素 而且必須趕快攫取冷藏起來"}, {"zh-tw": " I think I can do that. Now luckily, oxytocin is produced both in the brain and in the blood, so I could do this experiment without learning neurosurgery.", "en": " 我想我有辦法做到 很幸運地，催產素産生了 在腦袋裡、在血液裡都有 因此我不用學習神經科手術就能做實驗"}, {"zh-tw": " Then I had to measure morality. So taking on Morality with a capital M is a huge project.", "en": " 然後我必須測量道德 從大處著想來研究道德是一項大計劃"}, {"zh-tw": " So I started smaller. I studied one single virtue: trustworthiness.", "en": " 所以我從小處著手 我只單單研究一項美德： 那就是值得信賴度"}, {"zh-tw": " Why? I had shown in the early 2000s that countries with a higher proportion of trustworthy people are more prosperous.

So if I understood the chemistry of trustworthiness, I might help alleviate poverty.", "en": " 貧窮國家大體上是信賴感低落的國家 那麼如果我瞭解值得信賴度的化學原理 我就有可能幫助改善貧窮"}, {"zh-tw": " But I'm also a skeptic. I don't want to just ask people, \"Are you trustworthy?\" So instead I use the Jerry Maguire approach to research.", "en": " 不過我也有懷疑 我不想只問「你值不值得信賴」？ 因此我改採用 傑利馬蓋爾的方式進行研究"}, {"zh-tw": " If you're so virtuous, show me the money. So what we do in my lab is we tempt people with virtue and vice by using money.", "en": " 如果你那麼具有美德 就讓我看到錢 於是我們在實驗室裡做的是 用錢來測試人的美德和惡德"}, {"zh-tw": " Let me show you how we do that. So we recruit some people for an experiment.", "en": " 我來解釋這是怎麽做的 我們招募了一些人來做這個實驗"}, {"zh-tw": " They all get $10 if they agree to show up. We give them lots of instruction, and we never ever deceive them.", "en": " 如果同意來參加，就能得到$10 我們給那些人許多指示，並沒有欺騙他們"}, {"zh-tw": " Then we match them in pairs by computer.

So this was the birth of vampire economics.", "en": " 有個瘋狂的科學家用針 紮你手臂，抽出四管血液 而你現在要我把這個錢送給一個陌生人？ 這就是吸血鬼經濟的由來"}, {"zh-tw": " Make a decision and give me some blood. So in fact, experimental economists had run this test around the world, and for much higher stakes, and the consensus view was that the measure from the first person to the second was a measure of trust, and the transfer from the second person back to the first measured trustworthiness.", "en": " 你做個決定，再給我一點血 其實全世界到處都有 實驗經濟學家進行這種實驗 而且賭注比這還高出許多 所得到的共同看法是 第一個人給予第二個人的是對信賴的測量 而第二個人傳回給第一個人的是 可測量到的值得信賴度"}, {"zh-tw": " But in fact, economists were flummoxed on why the second person would ever return any money. They assumed money is good, why not keep it all? That's not what we found.", "en": " 但經濟學家感到困惑的 其實是爲什麽第二個人會還錢 他們假設錢是個好東西 爲什麽不全部留下來？ 但那不是我們發現的事實"}, {"zh-tw": " We found 90 percent of the first decision-makers sent money, and of those who received money, 95 percent returned some of it. But why? Well by measuring oxytocin we found that the more money the second person received, the more their brain produced oxytocin, and the more oxytocin on board, the more money they returned.", "en": " 我們發現首先做決定送錢出去的人有90% 而那些收到錢的人當中 有95%還了一點錢回去 爲什麽會這樣？ 我們測量了催產素 發現第二個人收到越多錢 腦袋裡就産生越多催產素 腦袋裡有越多的催產素 他們還回去的錢就越多"}, {"zh-tw": " So we have a biology of trustworthiness. But wait. What's wrong with this experiment? Two things.", "en": " 我們這下就找到了值得信賴度的生態 不過慢著，這實驗有什麽不對勁呢？ 有兩個不對勁"}, {"zh-tw": " One is that nothing in the body happens in isolation. So we measured nine other molecules that interact with oxytocin, but they didn't have any effect.", "en": " 第一個是：體內所發生的不會是獨立的事件 因此我們也測量與催產素互動的其他九種分子 但是他們並沒有什麽作用"}, {"zh-tw": " But the second is that I still only had this indirect relationship between oxytocin and trustworthiness. I didn't know for sure oxytocin caused trustworthiness.", "en": " 第二個是： 關於催產素和值得信賴度之間的關係 我還是只有這麽個間接證據 我當時還不能確定明白 催產素真的會導致值得信賴度"}, {"zh-tw": " So to make the experiment, I knew I'd have to go into the brain and manipulate oxytocin directly. I used everything short of a drill to get oxytocin into my own brain.", "en": " 因此，要做好這個實驗 我知道我得進入腦袋裡 並直接操弄催產素 除了鑽子之外，我什麽都用了 以便把催產素弄到自己的腦袋裡"}, {"zh-tw": " And I found I could do it with a nasal inhaler. So along with colleagues in Zurich, we put 200 men on oxytocin or placebo, had that same trust test with money, and we found that those on oxytocin not only showed more trust, we can more than double the number of people who sent all their money to a stranger -- all without altering mood or cognition.", "en": " 結果我發現我可以辦到 用一支鼻吸入器就行了 於是我和蘇黎世的同事們 利用催產素或安慰劑對200人 用錢進行同樣的那個試驗 結果發現吸入催產素的人不僅表現更多的信賴 我們甚至辦到讓會把錢送給陌生人的人數 增加到一倍以上 他們的心情和認知狀態都沒有什麽改變"}, {"zh-tw": " So oxytocin is the trust molecule, but is it the moral molecule? Using the oxytocin inhaler, we ran more studies. We showed that oxytocin infusion increases generosity in unilateral monetary transfers by 80 percent.", "en": " 那麼催產素果真是信賴的分子 但它會不會就是道德分子呢？ 利用催產素吸入器 我們進行了更多的研究 我們證實了注射催產素 會讓人更慷慨大方 在單向的送錢行爲上 有80%的人如此"}, {"zh-tw": " We showed it increases donations to charity by 50 percent. We've also investigated non-pharmacologic ways to raise oxytocin.", "en": " 我們證實了催産素 會讓慈善捐款增加50% 我們也探討了如何 能不用藥來增加催產素"}, {"zh-tw": " These include massage, dancing and praying. Yes, my mom was happy about that last one.", "en": " 這些方式包括按摩 跳舞和禱告 是的，我媽對最後這一項感到高興"}, {"zh-tw": " And whenever we raise oxytocin, people willingly open up their wallets and share money with strangers. But why do they do this? What does it feel like when your brain is flooded with oxytocin? To investigate this question, we ran an experiment where we had people watch a video of a father and his four year-old son, and his son has terminal brain cancer.", "en": " 只要我們增加催產素 人們就會樂於打開他們的錢包 拿錢來分享給陌生人 但是他們爲什麽會這樣做？ 當你的腦袋裡充滿了催產素 你會有怎樣的感受？ 爲了探討這個問題，我們做了一個試驗 我們讓一些人看影片 片中有一個父親和他四歲的兒子 他的兒子腦癌末期"}, {"zh-tw": " After they watched the video, we had them rate their feelings and took blood before and after to measure oxytocin. The change in oxytocin predicted their feelings of empathy.", "en": " 看過影片後，請他們爲自己的感受打分數 事前事後都測量他們體內的催產素 催產素的含量 預測了他們的同理心"}, {"zh-tw": " So it's empathy that makes us connect to other people. It's empathy that makes us help other people.", "en": " 那麼正是同理心 讓我們和別人産生聯繫 正是同理心讓我們會幫助別人"}, {"zh-tw": " It's empathy that makes us moral. Now this idea is not new.", "en": " 正是同理心使我們有了道德 這個想法並不新奇"}, {"zh-tw": " A then unknown philosopher named Adam Smith wrote a book in 1759 called \"The Theory of Moral Sentiments.\" In this book, Smith argued that we are moral creatures, not because of a top-down reason, but for a bottom-up reason. He said we're social creatures, so we share the emotions of others.", "en": " 有一位大家知道的哲學家叫 亞當史密斯在1759年寫了一本書 書名「道德感的理論」 在這本書裡，史密斯論證說 人之爲道德動物並非由上而下的推理結果 而是由下而上的推理結果 他說人是社會動物 因此我們分享別人的情感"}, {"zh-tw": " So if I do something that hurts you, I feel that pain. So I tend to avoid that.", "en": " 因此我若傷害你，我會感受到那個痛苦 因此我傾向於避免傷害你"}, {"zh-tw": " If I do something that makes you happy, I get to share your joy. So I tend to do those things.", "en": " 我若讓你愉快，我便能分享你的喜悅 因此我傾向於讓你愉快"}, {"zh-tw": " Now this is the same Adam Smith who, 17 years later, would write a little book called \"The Wealth of Nations\" -- the founding document of economics. But he was, in fact, a moral philosopher, and he was right on why we're moral.", "en": " 正是這位亞當史密斯 在17年後寫出一本叫「國富論」的小冊子－ 這本書是經濟學的基礎文獻 但他其實是道德哲學家，他對人之所以 有道德的看法確實正確"}, {"zh-tw": " I just found the molecule behind it. But knowing that molecule is valuable, because it tells us how to turn up this behavior and what turns it off.", "en": " 我才剛剛找到使人有道德的分子 但是知道了這個分子很有價值 因爲它告訴我們如何提高道德 也告訴我們窒息道德的是什麽"}, {"zh-tw": " In particular, it tells us why we see immorality. So to investigate immorality, let me bring you back now to 1980.", "en": " 它尤其告訴我們 爲什麽我們會看到不道德 因此爲了探討不道德 讓我帶領各位回到1980年"}, {"zh-tw": " I'm working at a gas station on the outskirts of Santa Barbara, California. You sit in a gas station all day, you see lots of morality and immorality, let me tell you.", "en": " 那時我在一個加油站工作 在加利佛尼亞州的聖塔巴巴拉 整天坐在加油站裡 各位，保證看到許多道德和不道德"}, {"zh-tw": " So one Sunday afternoon, a man walks into my cashier's booth with this beautiful jewelry box. Opens it up and there's a pearl necklace inside.", "en": " 有一天下午，有個人走進我的出納室 帶著漂亮的首飾盒 打開來看是珍珠項鏈在裡頭"}, {"zh-tw": " And he said, \"Hey, I was in the men's room. I just found this.

And a man says very excitedly, \"I was in your gas station a while ago, and I bought this jewelry for my wife, and I can't find it.\" I said, \"Pearl necklace?\" \"Yeah.\" \"Hey, a guy just found it.\" \"Oh, you're saving my life. Here's my phone number.", "en": " 我們得找到失主。」我說：「是呀。」 我們試著決定怎麽處理 這時電話響了 有個男人激動地說 「不久前我在你們的加油站 我買了首飾給太太，現在找不到了。」 我說：「珍珠項鏈？」「是的。」 「嘿，剛剛有人找到它了。」 「哦，你救了我的命，我的電話是..."}, {"zh-tw": " Tell that guy to wait half an hour. I'll be there and I'll give him a $200 reward.\" Great, so I tell the guy, \"Look, relax.", "en": " 告訴那個人等我半個鐘頭 我會過來，會給他$200賞金。」 好極了，我告訴那個人：「放心啦"}, {"zh-tw": " Get yourself a fat reward. Life's good.\" He said, \"I can't do it. I have this job interview in Galena in 15 minutes, and I need this job, I've got to go.\" Again he asked me, \"What do you think we should do?\" I'm in high school. I have no idea.", "en": " 真不錯，你有大賞金可以拿了。」 他說：「那可不成 15分鐘內我得在加林納面試 我需要這個工作，我得走了。」 他又問：「你想我們該怎麽辦？」 當時我還是高中生，不曉得該怎麽辦"}, {"zh-tw": " So I said, \"I'll hold it for you.\" He said, \"You know, you've been so nice, let's split the reward.\" I'll give you the jewelry, you give me a hundred dollars, and when the guy comes ... \" You see it. I was conned. So this is a classic con called the pigeon drop, and I was the pigeon.", "en": " 我就說：「我幫你把錢收下來。」 他說：「你人真好，我和你分賞金好了 我給你首飾，你給我一百元 那個人來的時候...」 各位都曉得，我受騙了 這個典型的騙局叫做「放鴿子」 我就是那只鴿子"}, {"zh-tw": " So the way many cons work is not that the conman gets the victim to trust him, it's that he shows he trusts the victim. Now we know what happens.", "en": " 瞧，騙局能得逞 並非騙子讓受騙者信賴他 而是他表現出信賴受騙者 我們現在曉得是怎回事了"}, {"zh-tw": " The victim's brain releases oxytocin, and you're opening up your wallet or purse, giving away the money. So who are these people who manipulate our oxytocin systems? We found, testing thousands of individuals, that five percent of the population don't release oxytocin on stimulus.", "en": " 受騙者腦袋裡釋放出催產素 於是你打開錢包把錢送出去了 操弄我們的催産素系統的 是些什麽人？ 經過測驗過幾千個人之後 我們發現有5%的人 面對刺激不會釋放出催產素"}, {"zh-tw": " So if you trust them, their brains don't release oxytocin. If there's money on the table, they keep it all.", "en": " 因此你若信賴他們，他們的腦袋裡不會釋放出催產素 要是桌子上有錢，他們會全部拿去"}, {"zh-tw": " So there's a technical word for these people in my lab. We call them bastards.", "en": " 我的實驗室裡給這種人一個技術名詞 我們管這種人叫「狗娘養的」"}, {"zh-tw": " These are not people you want to have a beer with. They have many of the attributes of psychopaths.", "en": " 你不會想跟這種人喝杯小酒 這種人具有許多精神變態者的特質"}, {"zh-tw": " Now there are other ways the system can be inhibited. One is through improper nurturing.", "en": " 還有其他方式壓制催産素系統 其中之一是營養不當"}, {"zh-tw": " So we've studied sexually abused women, and about half those don't release oxytocin on stimulus. You need enough nurturing for this system to develop properly.", "en": " 我們也研究了受性虐待的女人 其中約有一半面對刺激不會釋放出催產素 催産素系統要發展適當 必須有足夠的營養"}, {"zh-tw": " Also, high stress inhibits oxytocin. So we all know this, when we're really stressed out, we're not acting our best.", "en": " 此外，高度的精神壓力也會壓制催產素 大家都知道，精神壓力真很大時 我們的行爲表現不會良好"}, {"zh-tw": " There's another way oxytocin is inhibited, which is interesting -- through the action of testosterone. So we, in experiments, have administered testosterone to men.", "en": " 還有另一個方式壓制催產素，很有趣－ 受制於睾丸素 我們在實驗裡對男人施用了睾丸素"}, {"zh-tw": " And instead of sharing money, they become selfish. But interestingly, high testosterone males are also more likely to use their own money to punish others for being selfish.", "en": " 這下他們不僅不分錢 反而變得自私了 不過有趣的是 睾丸素量大的男人也比較 傾向于用自己的錢來懲罰別人的自私表現"}, {"zh-tw": " Now think about this. It means, within our own biology, we have the yin and yang of morality. We have oxytocin that connects us to others, makes us feel what they feel.", "en": " 想想看，那是說，在我們自己身體的 生態系統裡，道德是陰陽並蓄的 我們有催產素聯繫著我們和別人 讓我們感受到他們的感受"}, {"zh-tw": " And we have testosterone. And men have 10 times the testosterone as women, so men do this more than women -- we have testosterone that makes us want to punish people who behave immorally.", "en": " 我們也有睾丸素 男人的睾丸素十倍于女人的 因此男人比女人還常做出這種事－ 我們的睾丸素使得我們想要懲罰 行爲表現不道德的人"}, {"zh-tw": " We don't need God or government telling us what to do. It's all inside of us.", "en": " 我們不需要上帝或政府告訴我們怎麽辦 我們的身體裡什麽都有了"}, {"zh-tw": " So you may be wondering: these are beautiful laboratory experiments, do they really apply to real life? Yeah, I've been worrying about that too. So I've gone out of the lab to see if this really holds in our daily lives.", "en": " 你也許會納悶： 這些都是漂亮的實驗室解說 適用于真實的人生嗎？ 沒錯，我原來也一直擔心這個 因此我走出實驗室 看看這是否確立於我們每日的生活中"}, {"zh-tw": " So last summer, I attended a wedding in Southern England. 200 people in this beautiful Victorian mansion.", "en": " 去年夏天我在南英格蘭參加了一個婚禮 200人齊聚在一棟維多利亞式的大宅邸"}, {"zh-tw": " I didn't know a single person.

Weddings cause a release of oxytocin, but they do so in a very particular way. Who is the center of the wedding solar system? The bride.", "en": " 猜猜看結果如何 婚禮會導致催產素釋放 不過婚禮導致的催產素釋放很特別 誰是婚禮太陽系的中心點？ 當然是新娘"}, {"zh-tw": " She had the biggest increase in oxytocin. Who loves the wedding almost as much as the bride? Her mother, that's right.", "en": " 新娘釋放的催產素最多 誰幾乎和新娘一樣喜愛婚禮？ 她的母親，沒猜錯"}, {"zh-tw": " Her mother was number two. Then the groom's father, then the groom, then the family, then the friends -- arrayed around the bride like planets around the Sun.", "en": " 她的母親是第二名 然後是新郎的父親，再來是新郎 然後是家人，然後是朋友們－ 排列在新娘的四周 像是環繞著太陽的行星"}, {"zh-tw": " So I think it tells us that we've designed this ritual to connect us to this new couple, connect us emotionally. Why? Because we need them to be successful at reproducing to perpetuate the species.", "en": " 所以我認爲我們設計了這個儀式，爲的是要將我們 與一對新人聯繫在一起 在情緒上將我們聯繫起來 爲什麽？因爲我們需要他們成功地繁衍 好延續這個物種"}, {"zh-tw": " I also worried that my trust experiments with small amounts of money didn't really capture how often we actually trust our lives to strangers.

Many people are Tweeting right now.", "en": " 例如透過社群媒體 很多人現在正在推特大推特推"}, {"zh-tw": " So we investigated the role of social media and found the using social media produced a solid double-digit increase in oxytocin. So I ran this experiment recently for the Korean Broadcasting System.", "en": " 所以我們也探討了社群媒體的角色 結果發現使用社群媒體 實實在在産生了兩位數的催產素增長 我最近爲韓國廣播公司做了這麽一個實驗"}, {"zh-tw": " And they had the reporters and their producers participate. And one of these guys, he must have been 22, he had 150 percent spike in oxytocin.", "en": " 他們的記者和節目製作人都參與了 其中有個男生應該有22歲吧 他的催產素遽增150%"}, {"zh-tw": " I mean, astounding; no one has this.
