It has an amazing impact on our everyday life. Consider these statistics released by Activision. After one month of release of the game \"Call Of Duty: Black Ops,\" it had been played for 68,000 years worldwide, right? Would any of you complain if this was the case about doing linear algebra? So what we are asking in the lab is, how can we leverage that power? Now I want to step back a bit.

Actually, those action video game players have many other advantages in terms of attention, and one aspect of attention which is also improved for the better is our ability to track objects around in the world.", "en": " 所以，很明顯的，玩動作電玩並不會 導致注意力問題 實際上，這些動作電玩遊戲的玩家 有著許多有關注意力的特長 動作電玩遊戲能夠改善 我們在這世界裡追蹤物體的能力。"}, {"zh-tw": " This is something we use all the time. When you're driving, you're tracking, keeping track of the cars around you. You're also keeping track of the pedestrian, the running dog, and that's how you can actually be safe driving, right?

So I'm just going to show you an example where there is only one sad kid. It's easy because you can actually track it with your eyes. You can track, you can track, and then when it stops, and there is a question mark, and I ask you, did this kid have a coat or not? Was it yellow initially or blue? I hear a few yellow. Good. So most of you have a brain. I'm now going to ask you to do the task, but now with a little more challenging task. There are going to be three of them that are blue. Don't move your eyes.", "en": " 大家開始隨意活動，而你的任務是 持續追蹤那些在一開始有穿外套和 後來沒有穿外套的小孩。接著，我將會展示一個例子， 只有一個傷心的小孩。這非常的簡單 因為你只需要追蹤一個小孩。你可以追蹤， 你可以追蹤，然後他停下來的時候， 這裏會出現一個問號，我問你，這個小孩有穿外套嗎? 他本來是黃色還是藍色呢? 我聽到一些人說\"黃色\"。好，那證明你們大部分都有點腦袋 我現在想再給你們一個任務，但這次 會是一個更難的任務。這裏有 三個藍色的小孩。不要移動你的眼晴"}, {"zh-tw": " Please don't move your eyes.

A bit more challenging, right? Yellow or blue? Blue. We have some people that are serious out there. Yeah.", "en": " 這是你們這些動作電玩遊戲玩家能做到的 有一點挑戰性，是嗎? 黃色還是藍色呢? 藍色，我們當中有些人 相當認真呢! 好極了!"}, {"zh-tw": " Good. So in the same way that we actually see the effects of video games on people's behavior, we can use brain imaging and look at the impact of video games on the brain, and we do find many changes, but the main changes are actually to the brain networks that control attention. So one part is the parietal cortex which is very well known to control the orientation of attention. The other one is the frontal lobe, which controls how we sustain attention, and another one is the anterior cingulate, which controls how we allocate and regulate attention and resolve conflict.", "en": " 好! 就像我們能夠觀察到 電玩玩家行為上的變化一樣 我們可以利用腦掃描技術，看看這些電玩遊戲 對大腦的影響，我們發現很多的變化 但是最多的變化出現在用於控制注意力 的神經網絡。其中一個部分是在大腦頂葉 (parietal lobe)、 用於控制的注意力運用的大腦區域 第二個是大腦額葉 (frontal lobe)，它控制 我們的持續專注力 以及前帶狀皮層 (anterior cingulate)，它控制我們怎樣 分配及管理注意力及解決衝突"}, {"zh-tw": " Now, when we do brain imaging, we find that all three of these networks are actually much more efficient in people that play action games. This actually leads me to a rather counterintuitive finding in the literature about technology and the brain.", "en": " 我們參考腦掃描影像的時候，發現 動作遊戲玩家的這三個神經網絡 效率特別高 這引領我到一個在學術文獻中 有關科技與大腦的驚喜發現"}, {"zh-tw": " You all know about multitasking. You all have been faulty of multitasking when you're driving and you pick up your cellphone. Bad idea. Very bad idea. Why? Because as your attention shifts to your cell phone, you are actually losing the capacity to react swiftly to the car braking in front of you, and so you're much more likely to get engaged into a car accident.", "en": " 你們都知道甚麼是「多任務處理」(multitasking)吧。 你們都試過做多任務處理的壞事吧。 在駕車時用手機就是其中一個例子。不是很明智的想法，非常壞的想法。 為甚麼? 因為當你的注意力移到手機的時候 你實際上是失去了 敏捷剎車的能力，這時你遇上交通意外 的機會大大提高。"}, {"zh-tw": " Now, we can measure that kind of skills in the lab. We obviously don't ask people to drive around and see how many car accidents they have. That would be a little costly proposition. But we design tasks on the computer where we can measure, to millisecond accuracy, how good they are at switching from one task to another.", "en": " 現在，我們可以在實驗室裏量度這種技能 我們當然不會要求參加者漫無目的地駕駛 跟著量度他們的意外率。這會是一個 代價相當高的主張。但是我們設計了一些在電腦上運行的實驗 令我們可以以毫秒的準確度 去量度參加者從一個任務轉移到另一個任務的能力"}, {"zh-tw": " When we do that, we actually find that people that play a lot of action games are really, really good. They switch really fast, very swiftly. They pay a very small cost.", "en": " 我們這樣做的時候，我們發現 動作遊戲玩家的表現非常、非常的優異 他們在轉移任務上相當快，非常迅速。轉移任務的代價相對很少"}, {"zh-tw": " Now I'd like you to remember that result, and put it in the context of another group of technology users, a group which is actually much revered by society, which are people that engage in multimedia-tasking. What is multimedia-tasking? It's the fact that most of us, most of our children, are engaged with listening to music at the same time as they're doing search on the web at the same time as they're chatting on Facebook with their friends.", "en": " 我想你們記住這一個發現，並將它 套用到另一組的科技用家上 一個社會大眾都崇敬的群組 他們是經常作「多媒體任務處理」(multimedia-tasking) 的一群 甚麼是「多媒體任務處理」呢? 大部分我們的孩子當中 他們在網上搜尋資訊的時候 一邊聽著音樂 一邊與朋友在臉書 (facebook) 上交談"}, {"zh-tw": " That's a multimedia-tasker. There was a first study done by colleagues at Stanford and that we replicated that showed that those people that identify as being high multimedia-taskers are absolutely abysmal at multitasking.", "en": " 這就是會做多媒體任務處理的人 在史丹福大學的同事首先發表了一個研究 我們也複制了一樣的實驗結果 這些被界定為高效的多媒體任務處理者 其實是糟透的多任務處理者"}, {"zh-tw": " When we measure them in the lab, they're really bad. Right? So these kinds of results really makes two main points.", "en": " 當我們量度他們的表現時，他們的表現相當差 真的嗎? 這些實驗結果告訴我們 兩個重點"}, {"zh-tw": " The first one is that not all media are created equal. You can't compare the effect of multimedia-tasking and the effect of playing action games. They have totally different effects on different aspects of cognition, perception and attention.", "en": " 第一，不同媒體對我們的表現有不同的影響 你不能直接比較多媒體處理 與參加電玩動作遊戲的影響 它們對於我們眾多的認知能力，如感知、注意力方面 有截然不同的影響"}, {"zh-tw": " Even within video games, I'm telling you right now about these action-packed video games. Different video games have a different effect on your brains.", "en": " 我告訴你們，即使不同的電玩遊戲 這些充滿動作的電玩遊戲 對你們的大腦亦會產生不同的影響"}, {"zh-tw": " So we actually need to step into the lab and really measure what is the effect of each video game. The other lesson is that general wisdom carries no weight.", "en": " 我們真的要踏進實驗室 去量度每個遊戲所產生的影響 另外一件我學到的事就是大眾智慧不一定準確"}, {"zh-tw": " I showed that to you already, like we looked at the fact that despite a lot of screen time, those action gamers have a lot of very good vision, etc. Here, what was really striking is that these undergraduates that actually report engaging in a lot of high multimedia-tasking are convinced they aced the test.", "en": " 我已經向你展示，就像我們知道 即使長期對著電腦螢幕，那些動作遊戲玩家 有很好的視力，諸如此類... 這裏，令人吃驚的是 這些指自已經常作多媒體處理的大學本科生 真的相信自己在測試中做得很棒"}, {"zh-tw": " So you show them their data, you show them they are bad and they're like, \"Not possible.\" You know, they have this sort of gut feeling that, really, they are doing really, really good. That's another argument for why we need to step into the lab and really measure the impact of technology on the brain.", "en": " 你給他們看數據，看到自己那些糟糕的表現 他們會說: 不可能。你知道，他們 有著這種直覺，就是覺得他們自己表現得非常、非常的優異 這就是另一個我們要踏進實驗室的原因 去實際測量科技對我們的大腦產生的變化。"}, {"zh-tw": " Now in a sense, when we think about the effect of video games on the brain, it's very similar to the effect of wine on the health. There are some very poor uses of wine. There are some very poor uses of video games. But when consumed in reasonable doses, and at the right age, wine can be very good for health. There are actually specific molecules that have been identified in red wine as leading to greater life expectancy.", "en": " 在某一個程度上，當我們想著電玩遊戲 對我們大腦的影響，就正如 紅酒對我們健康的影響一樣。 有些人沒有對紅酒用得其所，同時有些人 也對電玩遊戲沒有用得其所。 在適當的年紀、飲用適量的紅酒 對我們的健康有莫大的裨益。紅酒中的某些 分子已經被驗證為 有助於延壽"}, {"zh-tw": " So it's the same way, like those action video games have a number of ingredients that are actually really powerful for brain plasticity, learning, attention, vision, etc., and so we need and we're working on understanding what are those active ingredients so that we can really then leverage them to deliver better games, either for education or for rehabilitation of patients. Now because we are interested in having an impact for education or rehabilitation of patients, we are actually not that interested in how those of you that choose to play video games for many hours on end perform.", "en": " 同樣地，一些動作遊戲 有大量的成份對於 大腦的可塑性、學習、注意力、視覺等等 都有強大的影響力。我們需要、亦正在努力 理解這些有效成份 令我們可以對這些遊戲善加利用 把它們應用在教育或病人復康的層面 正因為我們希望在 教育和復康治療有所貢獻，事實上我們 對你怎樣選購電玩遊戲以消磨時間 並不感太大興趣"}, {"zh-tw": " I'm much more interested in taking any of you and showing that by forcing you to play an action game, I can actually change your vision for the better, whether you want to play that action game or not, right?

So let me illustrate that step with a task which is called mental rotation.", "en": " 這一步就是要做些鍛鍊研究 讓我講解一下一個叫做 「心智旋轉」 的任務"}, {"zh-tw": " Mental rotation is a task where I'm going to ask you, and again you're going to do the task, to look at this shape.

Come on. That's our target shape.", "en": " 再來一次，用用你的腦袋吧。加油。 這是我們的目標圖形"}, {"zh-tw": " Third. Good! This is hard, right? Like, the reason that I asked you to do that is because you really feel your brain cringing, right? It doesn't really feel like playing mindless action video games. Well, what we do in these training studies is, people come to the lab, they do tasks like this one, we then force them to play 10 hours of action games.", "en": " 第三個，好! 這很難吧，是嗎? 我想你嘗試一下這個任務的原因是 你真的感受到你的腦袋扭作一團，對嗎? 這真的不太像參與一些不需要用腦袋的電玩動作遊戲 事實上，我們在這些鍛鍊研究中 參與者來到實驗室，他們就是要完成這些任務 之後我們強迫他們玩10小時的動作遊戲"}, {"zh-tw": " They don't play 10 hours of action games in a row. They do distributed practice, so little shots of 40 minutes several days over a period of two weeks.", "en": " 他們不會一下子玩十小時的動作遊戲 他們會接受分段訓練，每次四十分鐘 在兩星期中的某幾天完成訓練"}, {"zh-tw": " Then, once they are done with the training, they come back a few days later and they are tested again on a similar type of mental rotation task. So this is work from a colleague in Toronto. What they showed is that, initially, you know, subjects perform where they are expected to perform given their age. After two weeks of training on action video games, they actually perform better, and the improvement is still there five months after having done the training. That's really, really important. Why? Because I told you we want to use these games for education or for rehabilitation. We need to have effects that are going to be long-lasting.", "en": " 接著，當他們完成訓練後，他們會在幾天後 回到實驗室，再次接受差不多類型的 「心智旋轉」測試。這是加拿大多倫多一位同事 的研究結果。他們的實驗結果顯示， 最初，你知道，參與者的表現就與他們同齡的人 差不多。經過兩星期的 動作遊戲訓練後，他們的表現有進步 這個進步一直維持到他們受訓完畢後的 五個月。這是非常、非常重要的發現 為甚麼? 因為我告訴你，我們想用這些遊戲 作教育及復康治療用途。我們需要 持久的效果"}, {"zh-tw": " Now, at this point, a number of you are probably wondering well, what are you waiting for, to put on the market a game that would be good for the attention of my grandmother and that she would actually enjoy, or a game that would be great to rehabilitate the vision of my grandson who has amblyopia, for example? Well, we're working on it, but here is a challenge. There are brain scientists like me that are beginning to understand what are the good ingredients in games to promote positive effects, and that's what I'm going to call the broccoli side of the equation.", "en": " 現在，在這裏，你們當中或許有一部分會問 嗯，你們還在等甚麼呢，還不把 一個能夠增強我祖母注意力 同時她又喜歡的遊戲 又或者一個對我患有弱視的孫兒 視覺復康治療有益的遊戲推出市場? 嗯，我們正在努力當中，但遇到這樣的挑戰 有一些神經科學家，像我一樣，開始了解 遊戲中有正面作用的 好成份，我稱 它們為方程式中的西蘭花部分"}, {"zh-tw": " There is an entertainment software industry which is extremely deft at coming up with appealing products that you can't resist.

Who really wants to eat chocolate-covered broccoli? None of you.  And you probably have had that feeling, right, picking up an education game and sort of feeling, hmm, you know, it's not really fun, it's not really engaging. So what we need is really a new brand of chocolate, a brand of chocolate that is irresistible, that you really want to play, but that has all the ingredients, the good ingredients that are extracted from the broccoli that you can't recognize but are still working on your brains. And we're working on it, but it takes brain scientists to come and to get together, people that work in the entertainment software industry, and publishers, so these are not people that usually meet every day, but it's actually doable, and we are on the right track.", "en": " 問題是我們需要把兩者結合 就像烹調一樣 有誰會想吃鋪上巧克力的西蘭花呢? 沒有人。 你們或許有這樣的想法 對，拿起一副教育遊戲 然後某程度上覺得，唔，你知道啦，這真沒趣 這個遊戲真的不吸引。所以我們要的 是一個新的巧克力品牌，一個不能 抗拒的品牌，你會想參與其中 同時它又結合了所有成分，那些從 西蘭花中提取，你又不能辨認出、 又對你的腦袋甚有益處的有效成分。。我們正在努力中 但這需要神經科學家們 娛樂軟件工業專家 以及出版商聚起來，這些人一般來說不會 每天見面，但這是可行的 同時我們也踏上正確的軌道"}, {"zh-tw": " I'd like to leave you with that thought, and thank you for your attention.", "en": " 這是我想留給你們的想法 也感謝你們的關注"}], "title": "Daphne Bavelier Your Brain On Video Games"}
