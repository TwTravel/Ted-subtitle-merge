And that might seem a bit surprising, because my full-time workat the foundation is mostly about vaccines and seeds, about the things that we needto invent and deliver to help the poorest two billionlive better lives. But energy and climateare extremely important to these people; in fact, more importantthan to anyone else on the planet.", "en": " 今天我要談的是關於能量和氣候。 這或許有點讓人意外，因為你們也知道 我在基金會全職的工作主要關於疫苗和種子， 這些急需要發明且散佈的事情 以幫助20億貧民過更好生活。 但是能源和氣候對這些人也極其重要， 實際上，比對地球其他人來說更重要。"}, {"zh-tw": " The climate getting worse meansthat many years, their crops won't grow: there will be too much rain,not enough rain; things will change in ways their fragileenvironment simply can't support. And that leads to starvation, it leadsto uncertainty, it leads to unrest.", "en": " 氣候變得更壞，使得他們的穀物將有很多年無法成長。 有時將有太多雨，有時將會雨量不足。 所有改變的方式 以他們脆弱環境實在難以支撐。 結果將導致飢餓。 導致不確定的恐慌和動亂。"}, {"zh-tw": " So, the climate changeswill be terrible for them. Also, the price of energyis very important to them.", "en": " 因此，氣候變化對於他們是十分可怕的。 此外，能源的價格對他們非常重要。"}, {"zh-tw": " In fact, if you could pick just one thing to lower the price of to reduce poverty,by far you would pick energy. Now, the price of energyhas come down over time.", "en": " 實際上，如果你僅僅能挑一件東西降低價格， 以降低貧困，目前能源是最佳選項。 現下，能源的價格已經下降好長一段時間。"}, {"zh-tw": " Really advanced civilizationis based on advances in energy. The coal revolution fueledthe Industrial Revolution, and, even in the 1900s,we've seen a very rapid decline in the price of electricity, and that's why we haverefrigerators, air-conditioning; we can make modern materialsand do so many things.", "en": " 真的，人類的文明進步是基於能量的進展。 煤的革命點燃工業革命， 並且，在20世紀我們看見電力的價格迅速下降。 因此我們才能擁有冰箱，空調系統， 並且能製造進步的材料及那麼多東西。"}, {"zh-tw": " And so, we're in a wonderful situationwith electricity in the rich world. But as we make it cheaper --and let's say, let's go for making it twice as cheap -- we need to meet a new constraint, and that constraint has to do with CO2.", "en": " 也因此，我們處於一個有電力的美好富足世界。 如果，當我們使它更便宜 --讓我們努力使它兩倍便宜 -- 我們就必須面臨新的限制， 這限制就是CO2(二氧化碳)。"}, {"zh-tw": " CO2 is warming the planet, and the equation on CO2is actually a very straightforward one. If you sum up the CO2 that gets emitted, that leads to a temperature increase, and that temperature increaseleads to some very negative effects: the effects on the weather;perhaps worse, the indirect effects, in that the natural ecosystemscan't adjust to these rapid changes, and so you get ecosystem collapses.", "en": " CO2使地球變暖， 而描述CO2的方程式實際上是非常直觀的。 如果你把所有排出的CO2加起來， 那就會導致溫度增加， 而溫度增加進而導致一些負面效果。 這效應對天氣有影響，更糟的是或許是其他間接的效應 我們的自然生態系統不能適應這些迅速的變化， 生態系統因而崩潰。"}, {"zh-tw": " Now, the exact amount of how you mapfrom a certain increase of CO2 to what temperature will be,and where the positive feedbacks are -- there's some uncertainty there,but not very much. And there's certainly uncertaintyabout how bad those effects will be, but they will be extremely bad.", "en": " 現在對於精確的數據對應 例如在CO2的增加量與溫度上昇幅度的對應 以及是否有正向的回饋的存在 有些不確定性但不算太多 當然對於這些效應有多糟的看法，也有不確定性 但方向上一定是相當糟的"}, {"zh-tw": " I asked the top scientistson this several times: Do we really have to getdown to near zero?

So you've got a thing on the left,CO2, that you want to get to zero, and that's going to be basedon the number of people, the services each personis using on average, the energy, on average, for each service, and the CO2 being put outper unit of energy.", "en": " 這個方程式有四個因子。 及簡單的相乘。 因此，左式有一因子CO2，你想要它趨於零， 而那必須基於「人口的數量」， 「平均每人享用的服務」， 「每種服務的平均的能源」， 及「單位能源排出的CO2」。"}, {"zh-tw": " So let's look at each one of these, and see how we can get this down to zero. Probably, one of these numbers is goingto have to get pretty near to zero.", "en": " 現在，讓我們逐一審視 並且想想我們如何能把這變成零。 或許，這些數字之一必須讓它趨近於零。"}, {"zh-tw": " That's back from high school algebra. But let's take a look.", "en": " 現在讓我們複習中學的代數， 讓我們瞧瞧。"}, {"zh-tw": " First, we've got population. The world today has 6.8 billion people.", "en": " 首先是人口。 現下，世界有約68億人。"}, {"zh-tw": " That's headed up to about nine billion.

The second factor is the services we use.", "en": " 但目前是增加約1.3% 第2 個因子是我們使用的服務。"}, {"zh-tw": " This encompasses everything: the food we eat, clothing, TV, heating. These are very good things.", "en": " 這包含了所有的事情， 我們吃的食品，衣服，電視，暖氣。 這些是非常好的東西，"}, {"zh-tw": " Getting rid of poverty meansproviding these services to almost everyone on the planet.

And, in fact, these kids don't, so they're going out and readingtheir schoolwork under the street lamps.", "en": " 在富有的世界，或許前10億人口， 我們或許能縮減享受以減少用量， 但是每年，這平均數目是上升的， 整體說來，將來會成為兩倍以上 提供每人所享有的服務量 現在我們來談一項非常基本的服務。 你房子內有照明讓你能做你的家庭作業嗎? 實際上，很多孩子沒有，因此他們必須到屋外 並且在路燈下研讀他們的功課。"}, {"zh-tw": " Now, efficiency, \"E,\"the energy for each service -- here, finally we have some good news.

Some individual serviceseven bring it down by 90 percent.", "en": " 透過各式各樣的發明和製作照明設備的新方法， 透過不同的汽車類型，建築大樓的不同方法。 有許多你所使用的服務 整體而言已大幅降低消耗的能量 某些項目甚至降了幾乎90%"}, {"zh-tw": " There are other services,like how we make fertilizer, or how we do air transport, where the rooms for improvementare far, far less. And so overall, if we're optimistic,we may get a reduction of a factor of three to even,perhaps, a factor of six.", "en": " 但仍有不少項目如肥料製造 及空中運輸等 能夠改善的空間實在不大 因此概括的看，如果我們是樂觀主義者 我們有可能降低到三分之一，甚或到六分之一"}, {"zh-tw": " But for these first three factors now, we've gone from 26 billionto, at best, maybe 13 billion tons, and that just won't cut it. So let's look at this fourth factor --this is going to be a key one -- and this is the amount of CO2put out per each unit of energy.", "en": " 但是現在對這些前3 個因素來說， 我們或許充其量從260億降到130億公頓， 且很難再往下降 因此讓我們看第4因素 -- 這將是關鍵的一項 -- 每消耗單位能量所排出的CO2的數量。"}, {"zh-tw": " So the question is:Can you actually get that to zero? If you burn coal, no. If you burn natural gas, no.", "en": " 問題是，你真的能讓它趨於零？ 燃燒煤，不可能。 燃燒天然氣，不可能。"}, {"zh-tw": " Almost every waywe make electricity today, except for the emerging renewablesand nuclear, puts out CO2. And so, what we're going to haveto do at a global scale, is create a new system.", "en": " 幾乎我們今天用來發電的任一方法， 除了新興的再生能源和核能，都會排出CO2。 因此，我們以全球性角度考量將來必須做的， 是創建一新系統。"}, {"zh-tw": " So we need energy miracles. Now, when I use the term \"miracle,\"I don't mean something that's impossible.", "en": " 我們需要能源奇蹟。 我這裡使用奇蹟這個詞，並不意味著不可能發生。"}, {"zh-tw": " The microprocessor is a miracle.

Is there some kindof natural illustration, some demonstration that would grabpeople's imagination here?\" I thought back to a year agowhen I brought mosquitoes, and somehow people enjoyed that.", "en": " 但在這件事上我們必須加足馬力 並在緊迫的時限內創造出奇蹟 現在，我在想，我如何才能辦得到？ 是否有自然的圖示 或其他現成的範例可以讓人們想像? 我回想起一年前我帶一罐蚊子來到這裡 人們似乎覺得有趣"}, {"zh-tw": " It really got them involvedin the idea of, you know, there are people who live with mosquitoes.

So that's a tough one.", "en": " 此外選擇這些CO2同意存放的地點也將是艱難的課題， 但是最困難的是長期的問題。 誰能確定? 誰又能對比核廢料或其他廢料多數十億倍的東西 提出保證？ 這體積十分可觀 因此艱困可期"}, {"zh-tw": " Next would be nuclear.
