Whether it was concocting delicious meals from stolen scraps from the warehouse, sculpting people's hair with toenail clippers, or constructing weights from boulders in laundry bags tied on to tree limbs, prisoners learn how to make do with less, and many of them want to take this ingenuity that they've learned to the outside and start restaurants, barber shops, personal training businesses.", "en": " 你該知道，絞盡腦汁是牢獄生活的最佳寫照 你該知道，絞盡腦汁是牢獄生活的最佳寫照 把倉庫裡偷來的剩菜煮成佳餚 把倉庫裡偷來的剩菜煮成佳餚 用指甲剪幫人做髮型 把石頭裝到洗衣袋裡來製造重量，然後綁在樹枝上 囚犯學習如何用最簡單的方式做事 很多人想把這份才智 運用在出獄後的事業 像經營餐廳、理髮店 及個人健身訓練指導"}, {"zh-tw": " But there's no training, nothing to prepare them for that, no rehabilitation at all in prison, no one to help them write a business plan, figure out a way to translate the business concepts they intuitively grasp into legal enterprises, no access to the Internet, even.
