But how did that evolve for you as a thought, and end up being the TED Talk that you gave? SS: So I was really scared to get on this stage and talk about women, because I grew up in the business world, as I think so many of us did.", "en": " 我們第一次談話時或許主題不算是社群媒體 我們以為會是，但妳有許多其它想法 失落的領導位階特別是科技與社群媒體 但這些是如何讓妳產生想法最後成為妳上次在 TED 談話的主題呢？ 我本來很害怕在這裡討論女性議題 因為我在商場上打滾我想我們很多人都是如此"}, {"zh-tw": " You never talk about being a woman, because someone might notice that you're a woman, right? They might notice. Or worse, if you say \"woman,\" people on the other end of the table think you're asking for special treatment, or complaining. Or worse, about to sue them. And so I went through -- Right? I went through my entire business career, and never spoke about being a woman, never spoke about it publicly.", "en": " 妳不曾談論身為女性這件事因為這會讓人發覺妳是一位女性 他們可能會察覺，或者更糟妳提到「女性」時，桌子另一頭的人 會覺得妳在要求特別的待遇或是在抱怨 或者更糟的情況是要告發他們所以我在我... 是吧？我在我整個職涯中 從不在公開場合提及身為女性這件事"}, {"zh-tw": " But I also had noticed that it wasn't working. I came out of college over 20 years ago, and I thought that all of my peers were men and women, all the people above me were all men, but that would change, because your generation had done such an amazing job fighting for equality, equality was now ours for the taking.

You cannot be a serious business executive and speak about being a woman. You'll never be taken seriously again. But fortunately, there were the few, the proud -- like you -- who told me I should give the speech, and I asked myself the question Mark Zuckerberg might -- the founder of Facebook and my boss -- asks all of us, which is, what would I do if I wasn't afraid?

SS: Well, it's an important part of the journey. So I had -- TEDWomen -- the original one was in D.C. -- so I live here, so I had gotten on a plane the day before, and my daughter was three, she was clinging to my leg: \"Mommy, don't go.\" And Pat's a friend, and so, not related to the speech I was planning on giving, which was chock full of facts and figures, and nothing personal, I told Pat the story.

Are you kidding? I'm going to get on a stage and admit my daughter was clinging to my leg?

And I think that's a really important part of the journey.", "en": " 我說，在 TED 台上嗎？妳開玩笑的吧？ 我要站在講台上然後承認我女兒纏著我的腿？ 妳說，對，如果妳要讓更多女性扮演領導者的角色 妳必須承認這是有多困難的 而我就真的講了這故事那真的是旅程中很重要的一部分"}, {"zh-tw": " The same thing happened when I wrote my book. I started writing the book. I wrote a first chapter, I thought it was fabulous. It was chock-full of data and figures, I had three pages on matrilineal Maasai tribes, and their sociological patterns.

So talk about that process: deciding you'd go public with the private part, and then you would also put yourself in the position of something of an expert on how to resolve those challenges.", "en": " 我想書裡最令人震驚的是 我認為，這本書能切中要害在全世界引起共鳴 某個原因是妳在書裡分享私人的經驗而且講得很清楚 妳發現某些事是其他女性也必須知道的 妳也和其他人面對相同的挑戰 妳面對的障礙和困難可能其他人並不相信是一致的 跟我們談談這個過程：妳決定公開妳私人的生活 讓自己成為 克服挑戰的專家"}, {"zh-tw": " SS: After I did the TED Talk, what happened was -- you know, I never really expected to write a book, I'm not an author, I'm not a writer, and it was viewed a lot, and it really started impacting people's lives. I got this great --- one of the first letters I got was from a woman who said that she was offered a really big promotion at work, and she turned it down, and she told her best friend she turned it down, and her best friend said, you really need to watch this TED Talk.", "en": " 我在 TED 演講之後，接下來 我沒有想過會去寫一本書我並不是一位作家 但很多人看了這本書也開始影響很多人的生活 我覺得很棒 -- 我收到的第一封信是來自一位女性 說她的工作獲得升遷但她拒絕了 她跟她的好朋友說她拒絕了她好朋友說 妳真的應該去看看這個 TED 演講"}, {"zh-tw": " And so she watched this TED Talk, and she went back the next day, she took the job, she went home, and she handed her husband the grocery list.

There was a doctor I met who was an attending physician at Johns Hopkins, and he said that until he saw my TED Talk, it never really occurred to him that even though half the students in his med school classes were women, they weren't speaking as much as the men as he did his rounds.", "en": " 對我真正有意義的是它不只影響在公司中的女性 雖然回應有很多是來自商場上的女性也確實深深影響她們 但它也影響到所有不同環境下的人 我遇到一位在約翰·霍普金斯的主治醫師 他說在他看 TED 之前他從沒發現 雖然他醫學課有一半女學生 她們卻不像其他男生踴躍發言"}, {"zh-tw": " So he started paying attention, and as he waited for raised hands, he realized the men's hands were up. So he started encouraging the women to raise their hands more, and it still didn't work.", "en": " 之後他開始留意，等學生舉手結果他發現舉手的確實都是男生 所以他開始鼓勵女生舉手 但沒有什麼效果"}, {"zh-tw": " So he told everyone, no more hand raising, I'm cold-calling. So he could call evenly on men and women. And what he proved to himself was that the women knew the answers just as well or better, and he was able to go back to them and tell them that.", "en": " 他就告訴大家不用舉手了，用叫名字的 他就男女均等的叫名結果他發現 女生回答的跟男生一樣好，或更好 他決定要回課堂上告訴大家這件事"}, {"zh-tw": " And then there was the woman, stay-at-home mom, lives in a really difficult neighborhood, with not a great school, she said that TED Talk -- she's never had a corporate job, but that TED Talk inspired her to go to her school and fight for a better teacher for her child. And I guess it was part of was finding my own voice.", "en": " 還有一位家庭主婦住在非常糟的社區 不是好的學區她從沒在公司行號上班過 但 TED 演講啟發她讓她去學校替小孩爭取好的老師 我猜這像是找回自己的發聲權"}, {"zh-tw": " And I realized that other women and men could find their voice through it, which is why I went from the talk to the book. PM: And in the book, you not only found your voice, which is clear and strong in the book, but you also share what you've learned -- the experiences of other people in the lessons.", "en": " 我發覺其他女性和男性也能找回自己的發聲權 這也是為什麼我從演講變成出書 妳在書裡很明白的強調妳不只是找回妳的發聲權 妳也分享了妳的經驗 在這些過程中其他人的經驗"}, {"zh-tw": " And that's what I'm thinking about in terms of putting yourself in a -- you became a sort of expert in how you lean in. So what did that feel like, and become like in your life? To launch not just a book, not just a best-selling, best-viewed talk, but a movement, where people began to literally describe their actions at work as, I'm leaning in.", "en": " 這讓我想到，把妳自己放在... 妳像是成為挺身而進的專家 這是什麼的感覺？對妳人生有什麼改變？ 不只是出版一本最暢銷的書或最多人瀏覽的演講 也是一個運動讓人們開始可以說自己在職場上 我挺身而進"}, {"zh-tw": " SS: I mean, I'm grateful, I'm honored, I'm happy, and it's the very beginning. So I don't know if I'm an expert, or if anyone is an expert.

It's a word that's pretty much not used for little boys, because if a little boy leads, there's no negative word for it, it's expected. But if a little girl leads, she's bossy.", "en": " 在全世界我們都會說 女性很「跋扈」在所有言語中 都有形容小女生「跋扈」 的字眼 這是一個幾乎不會用在小男生身上的字眼 因為小男生位居領導時沒有負面的意義 那是預期中的但小女生位居領導時，她就是跋扈"}, {"zh-tw": " Now I know there aren't a lot of men here, but bear with me. If you're a man, you'll have to represent your gender.", "en": " 我知道現場沒有太多男性不過還是先忍耐一下 如果你是男性就請你代表全體的男生"}, {"zh-tw": " Please raise your hand if you've been told you're too aggressive at work.

Of course not. It's just that we judge them through a different lens, and a lot of the character traits that you must exhibit to perform at work, to get results, to lead, are ones that we think, in a man, he's a boss, and in a woman, she's bossy.", "en": " 我們真的認為女性比男性更積極？當然不是 這只是我們對女性用不同的標準 在工作上表現突出，領導他人的人 是男性，我們認為他是老闆 是女性，我們認為她很跋扈"}, {"zh-tw": " And the good news about this is that we can change this by acknowledging it. One of the happiest moments I had in this whole journey is, after the book came out, I stood on a stage with John Chambers, the CEO of Cisco.", "en": " 好消息是，我們可以因為認知這件事而改變它 在整個旅程中，我最開心的事是 在書出版之後，我和思科 (Cisco) 的執行長 約翰·錢伯斯 (Chambers) 一同站在台上"}, {"zh-tw": " He read the book.

That little girl has executive leadership skills.\" PM: I know that's what you're telling your daughter. SS: Absolutely. PM: And you did focus in the book -- and the reason, as you said, in writing it, was to create a dialogue about this.", "en": " 所以下次你們看到有人稱小女生 「跋扈」 時 你要微笑地走向那個人，跟他說 「那個女生不是跋扈她是有領導才能的。」 我知道妳是這樣教導妳女兒的當然 妳也在書中強調這點而妳提到原因是 妳想要引發這個議題的對話"}, {"zh-tw": " I mean, let's just put it out there, face the fact that women are -- in a time when we have more open doors, and more opportunities -- are still not getting to the leadership positions. So in the months that have come since the book, in which \"Lean In\" focused on that and said, here are some of the challenges that remain, and many of them we have to own within ourselves and look at ourselves.

At all. I mean, the women should be paid as much as the men.", "en": " 而我回說我一點也不覺得有什麼不對 一點也不，女性應該跟男性領一樣的薪水"}, {"zh-tw": " Everywhere I go, women tell me they ask for raises.
