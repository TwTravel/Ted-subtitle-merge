(出處來自蒙提·派森電影之一, 意指問題非常難以回答) 很不幸，我只將回答其中一個問題 所以請各位多包含，請別過於失望。 當人們想到擴增實境 會聯想到湯姆克魯斯在《關鍵報告》的場景 在電影中雙手操作螢幕介面的模樣。 但是，擴增實境並不只是科幻小說，"}, {"zh-tw": " Augmented reality is something that will happen in our lifetime, and it will happen because we have the tools to make it happen, and people need to be aware of that, because augmented reality will change our lives just as much as the Internet and the cell phone.

Step one is the step I'm wearing right now, Google Glass.", "en": " 擴增實境將在日常生活中發生， 未來我們即將體驗到它，因為我們有正確的工具， 所以我們必須重視， 因為擴增實境就像手機和網路一樣 會徹底顛覆我們的生活方式。 所以，如何實際應用擴增實境？ 第一步，就是我現在正在戴的 Google 眼鏡。"}, {"zh-tw": " I'm sure many of you are familiar with Google Glass.

I don't want to play anymore! No! Oh my God! Aaaah! CK: So that is the experience of a man on a roller coaster in fear of his life. What do you think that fan's experience is going to be when we take the video footage of an Adrian Peterson bursting through the line, shedding a tackler with a stiff-arm before sprinting in for a touchdown? What do you think that fan's experience is going to be when he's Messi sprinting down the pitch putting the ball in the back of the net, or Federer serving in Wimbledon?
