In many cases, you can also see how a building looks from a nearby street.", "en": " 舉例來說，這是洛桑聯邦理工學院的鳥瞰圖 舉例來說，這是洛桑聯邦理工學院的鳥瞰圖 很多時候你也可以從旁邊的街上 看到某棟建築物的的長相"}, {"zh-tw": " This is pretty amazing. But there's something missing in this wonderful tour: It's time.", "en": " 這真的很神奇 但這趟美妙的旅程還少了一樣東西： 時間"}, {"zh-tw": " i'm not really sure when this picture was taken. I'm not even sure it was taken at the same moment as the bird's-eye view.", "en": " 我不確定這張照片是什麼時候拍的 我甚至無法確定這是在鳥瞰圖的當下拍的 我甚至無法確定這是在鳥瞰圖的當下拍的 在我的實驗室的研發工具"}, {"zh-tw": " In my lab, we develop tools to travel not only in space but also through time. The kind of question we're asking is Is it possible to build something like Google Maps of the past? Can I add a slider on top of Google Maps and just change the year, seeing how it was 100 years before, 1,000 years before? Is that possible? Can I reconstruct social networks of the past? Can I make a Facebook of the Middle Ages? So, can I build time machines? Maybe we can just say, \"No, it's not possible.\" Or, maybe, we can think of it from an information point of view.", "en": " 不止用在空間的旅行 也用在時間的旅行 我們想問的問題是 有辦法做出過往時間的Google Maps嗎？ 有辦法在Google Maps上增加一個滑桿 只要改變年份 就可以看到100年前 1000年前的樣子嗎？ 這可能嗎？ 我能夠重建過去的社群網路嗎？ 我可以建立中世紀時的Facebook嗎？ 我能夠建造時光機嗎？ 我們可以說：「不，這不可能。」 或者，我們可以從資訊的角度來看"}, {"zh-tw": " This is what I call the information mushroom. Vertically, you have the time.", "en": " 我把這個稱之為資訊蘑菇 縱軸是時間"}, {"zh-tw": " and horizontally, the amount of digital information available. Obviously, in the last 10 years, we have much information.", "en": " 橫軸是我們擁有的數位資訊 很明顯的，在過去的10年中我們擁有很大量的資訊"}, {"zh-tw": " And obviously the more we go in the past, the less information we have. If we want to build something like Google Maps of the past, or Facebook of the past, we need to enlarge this space, we need to make that like a rectangle.", "en": " 也看得出來，越早以前資訊就越少 如果我們想建立過去的Google Maps 或是過去的Facebook 我們就必須擴大這個空間 像是一個長方形"}, {"zh-tw": " How do we do that? One way is digitization. There's a lot of material available -- newspaper, printed books, thousands of printed books.", "en": " 這要如何做到呢？ 一個辦法是數位化 有很多的材料可以用-- 報紙、印刷書本 好幾千本印刷書本"}, {"zh-tw": " I can digitize all these. I can extract information from these.", "en": " 我可以把它們全部數位化 我可以從當中截取資訊"}, {"zh-tw": " Of course, the more you go in the past,the less information you will have. So, it might not be enough.", "en": " 當然，當時間越往前你擁有的資訊就越少 所以，這可能不夠"}, {"zh-tw": " So, I can do what historians do. I can extrapolate.", "en": " 因此，我可以做史學家們做的事 我可以推論"}, {"zh-tw": " This is what we call, in computer science, simulation. If I take a log book, I can consider, it's not just a log book of a Venetian captain going to a particular journey.", "en": " 這就是我們在電腦科學中所稱的模擬 如果我有一本航海日誌 我可以不只把它看成是一位威尼斯船長特定的航程"}, {"zh-tw": " I can consider it is actually a log book which is representative ofmany journeys of that period. I'm extrapolating.", "en": " 我可以把它看成是當時許多航程的代表 我就是在推論"}, {"zh-tw": " If I have a painting of a facade, I can consider it's not just that particular building, but probably it also shares the same grammar of buildings where we lost any information. So if we want to construct a time machine, we need two things.", "en": " 如果我有一幅建築外觀的繪畫 我可以不只把它看作特定的一棟建築 這棟建築可能和其它遺失了資訊的建築有著相同的風格 如果我們想要打造一台時光機 我們需要兩樣東西"}, {"zh-tw": " We need very large archives, and we need excellent specialists. The Venice Time Machine, the project I'm going to talk to you about, is a joint project between the EPFL and the University of Venice Ca'Foscari.", "en": " 大量的檔案 也需要很厲害的專家 威尼斯時光機 (The Venice Time Machine) 也就是我接下來要跟你們談論的計劃 這個計劃是由洛桑聯邦理工學院和威尼斯大學所合作"}, {"zh-tw": " There's something very peculiar about Venice, that its administration has been very, very bureaucratic. They've been keeping track of everything, almost like Google today.", "en": " 威尼斯有個特點 它的管理非常非常的官僚 他們持續紀錄了每一件事情 就像Google一樣"}, {"zh-tw": " At the Archivio di Stato, you have 80 kilometers of archives documenting every aspect of the life of Venice overmore than 1,000 years.

This is all there.", "en": " 在這城市裡面的每一個變化 都記錄得一清二楚"}, {"zh-tw": " We are setting up a 10-year digitization program which has the objective of transforming this immense archive into a giant information system.

In particular, traditional opticalcharacter recognition method that can be used for printed manuscripts, they do not work well on the handwritten document.", "en": " 當然，只有數位化是不夠的 因為這些文件大部份都是用拉丁、托斯卡納、威尼斯方言寫的 所以有時必須轉錄、翻譯它們並編成索引 而這理所當然並不容易 特別是當傳統的光學字符識別法運用在手寫稿上 效果不若列印稿的時候"}, {"zh-tw": " So the solution is actually to take inspiration from another domain: speech recognition. This is a domain of something that seems impossible, which can actually be done, simply by putting additional constraints.", "en": " 解決辦法是借助另外一個方法：語音識別 這個方法看似不可能但卻是可行的 只需要加入額外的條件"}, {"zh-tw": " If you have a very good model of a language which is used, if you have a very good model of a document, how well they are structured. And these are administrative documents.", "en": " 如果你有一個很好的語言模型曾經被使用過 如果你有一個很好的文件模型那它們就已經很完整了"}, {"zh-tw": " They are well structured in many cases. If you divide this huge archive into smaller subsets where a smaller subsetactually shares similar features, then there's a chance of success.", "en": " 而這些是官方文件很多都非常完整 當你把這巨大的檔案分成許多小子集 而每個子集都有共同的特徵的話 成功的機會就很大"}, {"zh-tw": " If we reach that stage, then there's something else: we can extract from this document events. Actually probably 10 billion events can be extracted from this archive.", "en": " 如果我們達到這個階段就能夠做其他事情： 汲取這個文件中的資訊 事實上這個檔案中大約可以汲取出100億個事件"}, {"zh-tw": " And this giant information system can be searched in many ways. You can ask questions like, \"Who lived in this palazzo in 1323?\" \"How much cost a sea bream at the Realto market in 1434?\" \"What was the salary of a glass maker in Murano maybe over a decade?\" You can ask even bigger questions because it will be semantically coded.", "en": " 這個巨型資訊系統可以用多種方法搜尋 例如，你可以問這樣的問題 「誰在1323年住在這座皇宮裡面？」 「1434年時Realto市場裡一條鯛魚多少錢？」 「在十年中Murano玻璃工匠的薪水多高？」 你也可以問更大的問題 因為它是用語意編碼的"}, {"zh-tw": " And then what you can do is put that in space, because much of this information is spatial. And from that, you can do things like reconstructing this extraordinary journey of that city that managed tohave a sustainable development over a thousand years, managing to have all the time a form of equilibrium with its environment.", "en": " 然後你就可以把它放在空間中 因為大部份的資訊都是空間性的 接下來就可以重建這座城市非凡的旅程 這座城市設法永續發展超過1000年 設法讓時間和環境取得平衡"}, {"zh-tw": " You can reconstruct that journey, visualize it in many different ways. But of course, you cannot understand Venice if you just look at the city.", "en": " 你可以重建這趟旅程 用不同方法看到它 但是當然，如果只是用看的你無法了解威尼斯"}, {"zh-tw": " You have to put it in a larger European context. So the idea is also to document all the things that worked at the European level.", "en": " 你要把它放到一個更廣大、歐洲的概念裡面 所以這個想法同時也要把檔案放在歐洲的層級中"}, {"zh-tw": " We can reconstruct also the journey of the Venetian maritime empire, how it progressively controlled the Adriatic Sea, how it became the most powerful medieval empire of its time, controlling most of the sea routes from the east to the south. But you can even do other things, because in these maritime routes, there are regular patterns.", "en": " 我們也可以重建威尼斯這個海上帝國的旅程 了解它是如何積極地控制亞德里亞海的 如何成為中世紀控制了大部分東方以及南方航線的最強大的帝國 你甚至可以做到其它事 因為這些航線有相似之處"}, {"zh-tw": " You can go one step beyond and actually create a simulation system, create a Mediterranean simulator which is capable actually of reconstructing even the information we are missing, which would enable us to have questions you could ask like if you were using a route planner. \"If I am in Corfu in June 1323 and want to go to Constantinople, where can I take a boat?\" Probably we can answer this question with one or two or three days' precision.", "en": " 可以更進一步建立模擬系統 建立地中海模擬器 它可以重建我們遺失的資訊 讓你在用路線規劃時的問題可以得到解答 「如果我在1323年的科孚，想去康士坦丁堡我要去哪裡搭船？」 我們或許可以在一天，兩天或三天的準確度之內回答這個問題"}, {"zh-tw": " \"How much will it cost?\" \"What are the chance of encountering pirates?\" Of course, you understand, the central scientific challengeof a project like this one is qualifying, quantifying and representing uncertainty and inconsistencyat each step of this process. There are errors everywhere, errors in the document, it'sthe wrong name of the captain, some of the boats never actually took to sea.", "en": " 「要花多少錢？」 「有多大的機率遇到海盜？」 當然，你懂的，這種計劃最大的挑戰在於修飾、量化 並在每一步驟重現不確定以及不一致的資料 這份文件裡到處都有錯誤 文件裡的錯誤包括把船長的名字搞錯了，而有些船根本沒下過水"}, {"zh-tw": " There are errors in translation, interpretative biases, and on top of that, if you add algorithmic processes, you're going to have errors in recognition, errors in extraction, so you have very, very uncertain data. So how can we detect andcorrect these inconsistencies? How can we represent that form of uncertainty? It's difficult. One thing you can do is document each step of the process, not only coding the historical information but what we call the meta-historical information, how is historical knowledge constructed, documenting each step.", "en": " 也有翻譯的錯誤，翻譯時的誤解 此外，在用演算法的時候會有辨認上的錯誤 汲取上的錯誤 所以你會得到相當相當不確定的數據 那我們要如何找到並修正這些不一致之處呢？ 我們如何重現不確定性？ 很困難。你可以做的一件事是把每一個步驟建檔 不只是把歷史訊息編碼 也把所謂的元歷史(meta-history)訊息 也就是建立歷史知識的根基的每一步都建檔"}, {"zh-tw": " That will not guarantee that we actually converge toward a single story of Venice, but probably we can actually reconstruct a fully documented potential story of Venice. Maybe there's not a single map.", "en": " 這沒辦法保證我們確實涵蓋到威尼斯的每一個故事 但我們確實根據完整文件重建了威尼斯每一個可能發生過的故事 也許地圖不止一幅"}, {"zh-tw": " Maybe there are several maps. The system should allow for that, because we have to deal witha new form of uncertainty, which is really new for this type of giant databases.", "en": " 可能有好幾幅地圖 系統應該要可以到這樣子 因為我們得面對一個新型態的不確定性 包含這樣龐大且新穎的資料庫"}, {"zh-tw": " And how should we communicate this new research to a large audience? Again, Venice is extraordinary for that. With the millions of visitors that come every year, it's actually one of the best places to try to invent the museum of the future.", "en": " 那我們要如何把這個新研究告訴大眾呢？ 威尼斯是個絕佳的地方 由於每年有好幾百萬的遊客 這裡是試著創造未來博物館最好的地點之一"}, {"zh-tw": " Imagine, horizontally you see the reconstructed map of a given year, and vertically, you see the document that served the reconstruction, paintings, for instance. Imagine an immersive system that permits to go and dive and reconstructthe Venice of a given year, some experience you could share within a group.", "en": " 想想，平躺的是建立出的特定年份的地圖 立著的是用來重建這幅地圖的文件例如，圖畫 想像一個讓你彷彿置身於特定年份的威尼斯的沈浸式系統 一種讓你能和別人分享的經驗"}, {"zh-tw": " On the contrary, imagine actually that you start from a document, a Venetian manuscript, and you show, actually, whatyou can construct out of it, how it is decoded, how the context of that document can be recreated. This is an image from an exhibit which is currently conducted in Geneva with that type of system.", "en": " 相反的，想像你能夠從一份威尼斯手稿開始 看看你到底能夠從當中建立什麼 它是如何被解碼、當中所蘊含的概念是如何重建 這張圖片是現在在日內瓦的展覽當中展出 它就是用這類系統所建立的"}, {"zh-tw": " So to conclude, we can say that research in the humanities is about to undergo an evolution which is maybe similar to what happened to life sciences 30 years ago. It's really a question of scale.", "en": " 總而言之 人文研究正走向一場 像是生命科學30年前所經歷的革命 事實上，問題在於它的規模"}, {"zh-tw": " We see projects which are much beyond any single research team can do, and this is really new for the humanities, which very often take the habit of working in small groups or only with a couple of researchers. When you visit the Archivio di Stato, you feel this is beyond what any single team can do, and that should be a joint and common effort.", "en": " 我們看到 這些計劃遠超出任何一個小型研究團隊所能夠做的 這在人文領域也很新穎 人文領域習慣小團隊或是只和數個研究員合作 當你造訪政府典藏中心時 你會感覺到這超過任何一個團隊做得到的 這必須依賴團隊合作"}, {"zh-tw": " So what we must do for this paradigm shift is actually foster a new generation of \"digital humanists\" that are going to be ready for this shift. I thank you very much.", "en": " 在這個典範轉移中 我們必須培養一些新一代 準備好迎接這個進步的「數位」人文學家 謝謝"}], "title": "Frederic Kaplan How I Built An Information Time Machine"}
