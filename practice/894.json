That stuff's cool.\" Walked into the Lego store.", "en": " 這故事與我當年只有四歲的孩子有關 我想：\"哎呀，我應該買給孩子樂高玩具\" \"他一定會很喜歡\" 然後我就走進樂高玩具店"}, {"zh-tw": " Bought him this. It's totally appropriate for a four-year-old.", "en": " 買了這套回家 這完全是適合四歲的兒童"}, {"zh-tw": " I think the box says -- let's see here -- \"8 to 12\" on it. I turn to my wife and said, \"Who are we buying this for?\" She's like, \"Oh, us.\" I'm like, \"Okay. All right. That's cool.\" Pretty soon it got a little bit out of control.", "en": " 我想包裝外殼上寫 -- 讓我看看 -- 適齡：8到12歲 我問我老婆：\"糟糕，我們是要買給誰阿?\" 她說：\"喔，不然自己玩好了\"。我回：\"好吧，我也挺喜歡這個的\" 很快的事情就有點脫序了"}, {"zh-tw": " The dining room looked like this.

I suppose we are.\" So then once you do that you're like, \"Oh, crap. Where am I going to put all this?\" So you go to The Container Store and spend an enormous amount of money, and then you start this crazy sorting process that never -- it's just nuts.", "en": " 我女兒，這150磅的樂高送來的當天晚上，睡前我幫她蓋被 然後我說 \"小甜心，妳是我的寶貝\" 然後她回說：\"不是，樂高才是寶貝\" 然後她接著說：\"老爸，我們是樂高界的郭台銘\" 我回說：\"是呀\" \"我們是樂高郭台銘\" 買了這麼多的樂高後 你會想到：\"喔，我是豬嗎?我得幫這些東西好好找個家\" 然後就開始逛貨櫃商店（註：美國賣儲物箱的賣場） 很快的在裡面買一大堆東西 然後就開始作瘋狂的分類工作 從來沒有如此 瘋狂"}, {"zh-tw": " Whatever.

Then you notice that if that Lego-provided CAD program isn't enough, there's an entire open-source, third-party, independent Lego CAD program that lets you do 3D modeling and 3D rendering and make, in fact, movies out of Lego, 3D films of which there are thousands on YouTube, and some of them sort of mimicking famous films and some totally original content -- just beautiful -- and people recreating all sorts of things.", "en": " 真的非常瘋狂 你們也會注意到 如果這種CAD程式有所不足怎麼辦 有人開發出另一款軟體 同時還開放程式碼 讓你可以3D建模（用多邊形組合成立體模型） 3D渲染（在立體模型上貼顏色或材質） 有人用樂高拍影片 這類影片 Youtube上有一大堆 有些影片會模仿最受歡迎的電影 有一些是自創的影片 超棒的 有人會重現某些場景"}, {"zh-tw": " I have to take a moment. I love the guy who's like running away with his clasps, his hooks.", "en": " 我要講一下這個 我喜歡這個小人 用像小鉤子的手扣住車跑動的樣子"}, {"zh-tw": " Okay. Anyway.

But just very quickly -- we'll just see if I can do this quick.", "en": " 天阿，我快沒時間了 我要非常快速的 讓你們看看我組裝的實力"}, {"zh-tw": " Because there aren't enough TED logos around here.
