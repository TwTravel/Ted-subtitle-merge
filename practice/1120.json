Then there were the emotional sacrifices: How can one live with a woman while having so many secrets? How can one explain what one does at night in the lab, every single night? Of course, there was another kind of sacrifice involving his family that I understood much later.", "en": " 一直是經濟拮据 他也付出了情感上的代價 一個身負重多秘密的人要如何和妻子共處? 如何去解釋他每晚在實驗室裡在做些什麼? 還有一種代價少不了的 就是犧牲他的家庭，這我後來才明白"}, {"zh-tw": " One day my father introduced me to my sister.

Time passed, and they thought he had surely forgotten them, at first.", "en": " 從某天起父親就真的不見蹤影 時光飛逝 起初，孩子們都以為 父親已經忘了他們"}, {"zh-tw": " Then as time passed, at the end of almost two years, they thought, \"Well, perhaps our father has died.\" And then I understood that asking my father so many questions was stirring up a whole past he probably didn't feel like talking about because it was painful. And while my half brother and sister thought they'd been abandoned, orphaned, my father was making false papers.", "en": " 又過了一段時間 幾乎快過了兩年，他們想 「父親可能過世了吧」 我這才發現 我問了父親許多問題 都會讓他想起那些過去，他大概不想多談的事情 因為太痛苦了 在我的異母兄姐認為自己被遺棄 成了孤兒的時候 我父親其實在偽造文書"}, {"zh-tw": " And if he did not tell them, it was of course to protect them. After the liberation he made false papers to allow the survivors of concentration camps to immigrate to Palestine before the creation of Israel.", "en": " 他不告訴兒女，當然是想保護他們 解放運動後他繼續偽造文書 幫助集中營的倖存者在以色列建國前 移民到巴勒斯坦"}, {"zh-tw": " And then, as he was a staunch anti-colonialist, he made false papers for Algerians during the Algerian war.
