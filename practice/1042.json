And she called, and she said, \"I'm really struggling with howto write about you on the little flyer.\" And I thought,\"Well, what's the struggle?\" And she said, \"Well, I saw you speak, and I'm going to call youa researcher, I think, but I'm afraid if I call youa researcher, no one will come, because they'll thinkyou're boring and irrelevant.\" And I was like, \"Okay.\" And she said, \"But the thingI liked about your talk is you're a storyteller."}, {"zh-tw": "「是因為很像在說故事」「所以我要稱你為說書人」我內心學術、沒安全感那面就跳出來「妳要叫我什麼？」她說：「說故事的人阿」我心想：「何不乾脆叫我魔法小精靈？」「讓我想一下」我鼓起勇氣我想：我是說書人", "en": "So I think what I'll dois just call you a storyteller.\" And of course, the academic,insecure part of me was like, \"You're goingto call me a what?\" And she said, \"I'm goingto call you a storyteller.\" And I was like, \"Why not 'magic pixie'?\" I was like, \"Let me thinkabout this for a second.\" I tried to call deep on my courage. And I thought, you know,I am a storyteller."}, {"zh-tw": "我是定性研究員", "en": "I'm a qualitative researcher. I collect stories; that's what I do."}, {"zh-tw": "我工作就是搜集故事也許故事就是有靈魂的數據或許我真的就是說書人", "en": "And maybe storiesare just data with a soul. And maybe I'm just a storyteller."}, {"zh-tw": "我就說：「好吧」「你就叫我研究說書員」她就回：「哈，沒這東西」所以我是個研究說書員我今天要告訴各位的是關於看法的擴展我要分享給各位幾個故事是我研究的一部份這部份徹底的擴展了我的觀點並確實改變了我生活、愛、工作、為人父母的過程", "en": "And so I said, \"You know what? Why don't you just sayI'm a researcher-storyteller.\" And she went, \"Ha ha.There's no such thing.\" So I'm a researcher-storyteller,and I'm going to talk to you today -- we're talking aboutexpanding perception -- and so I want to talk to youand tell some stories about a piece of my researchthat fundamentally expanded my perception and really actually changedthe way that I live and love and work and parent. And this is where my story starts."}, {"zh-tw": "這是我故事的開始當時我還是個年輕的研究員，念博士第一年，我有個教授告訴我們「是這樣的」「你無法測量的，就不存在」我想他只是講些好聽話而已我就說：「真的嗎？」他回：「千真萬確」你們要明白我學士、碩士都念社工我的博士學位也是社工所以我的學術事業都圍繞著一些相信「生活很混亂，愛它吧」的人但我是那種「生活很混亂」「那就收拾整齊」「並收進便當盒裡」的人我想我找到我的路發現一個能帶著我的事業社工常說的一句話偎緊工作令人不舒服的部份我則是那種，遇到不愉快就趕緊", "en": "When I was a young researcher,doctoral student, my first year, I hada research professor who said to us, \"Here's the thing, if you cannotmeasure it, it does not exist.\" And I thought he was justsweet-talking me. I was like, \"Really?\"and he was like, \"Absolutely.\" And so you have to understand that I have a bachelor'sand a master's in social work, and I was getting my Ph.D. in social work,so my entire academic career was surrounded by people who kind ofbelieved in the \"life's messy, love it.\" And I'm more of the, \"life's messy,clean it up, organize it and put it into a bento box.\" And so to think that I had found my way,to found a career that takes me -- really, one of the big sayingsin social work is, \"Lean into the discomfort of the work.\" And I'm like, knock discomfortupside the head and move it over and get all A's."}, {"zh-tw": "想辦法對付他並拿A我這樣催眠自己對此很期待", "en": "That was my mantra. So I was very excited about this."}, {"zh-tw": "我想，這就是我要做的大事了因為我對這些混亂的話題有興趣但我想讓他們變得不混亂", "en": "And so I thought, you know what,this is the career for me, because I am interestedin some messy topics. But I want to be ableto make them not messy."}, {"zh-tw": "我想搞懂他們我想徹底研究這些我知道很重要的事", "en": "I want to understand them. I want to hack into these thingsthat I know are important and lay the code out for everyone to see."}, {"zh-tw": "並把秘密找出來分享給大家所以我從\"連結\"開始因為，當了十年社工你會理解到連結就是我們都在此的原因", "en": "So where I started was with connection. Because, by the timeyou're a social worker for 10 years, what you realize is that connectionis why we're here."}, {"zh-tw": "這是我們生命被賦予意義的東西一切都與這相關", "en": "It's what gives purposeand meaning to our lives. This is what it's all about."}, {"zh-tw": "不管你跟哪個領域的人聊天不論是社會公平、心理健康、 受虐與疏忽照顧我們知道，連結感受到彼此的連結是在神經生物學來說，是我們天生的我們在此的原因所以我想，我要以連結開始研究", "en": "It doesn't matter whetheryou talk to people who work in social justice,mental health and abuse and neglect, what we know is that connection,the ability to feel connected, is -- neurobiologicallythat's how we're wired -- it's why we're here. So I thought, you know what,I'm going to start with connection."}, {"zh-tw": "我想你們都經歷過老闆給的工作評價可能會是37件極佳的表現但有一件是 -- 尚待改進你腦子只會想這那尚待改進的事我的研究也是這樣因為當你問人們關於愛的故事他們會告訴你心碎的故事當你問人們關於歸屬的故事他們會告訴你那些他們被排除在外", "en": "Well, you know that situation where you get an evaluationfrom your boss, and she tells you 37 thingsthat you do really awesome, and one \"opportunity for growth?\" And all you can think aboutis that opportunity for growth, right? Well, apparently this is the waymy work went as well, because, when you ask people about love,they tell you about heartbreak. When you ask people about belonging, they'll tell you their most excruciatingexperiences of being excluded."}, {"zh-tw": "的椎心經驗因為當你問人們關於連結的故事他們會告訴你那些分離的故事所以很快的，研究開始的六週後就是這件不知如何命名的事讓連結瓦解我不懂也從未見過", "en": "And when you ask people about connection, the stories they told mewere about disconnection. So very quickly -- really about six weeksinto this research -- I ran into this unnamed thingthat absolutely unraveled connection in a way that I didn't understandor had never seen."}, {"zh-tw": "所以我將研究暫停我想，我一定要知道這是為什麼", "en": "And so I pulled back out of the research and thought, I needto figure out what this is. And it turned out to be shame."}, {"zh-tw": "原來就是羞恥羞恥很好理解就是害怕失去連結我的哪些部份如果外人知道了會不會不想與我往來羞恥，我可以告訴你們是普遍存在的，我們都有那些沒有羞恥心的人沒有同情心與人類連結", "en": "And shame is really easily understoodas the fear of disconnection: Is there something about me that,if other people know it or see it, that I won't be worthy of connection? The things I can tell you about it: It's universal; we all have it. The only people who don't experience shame have no capacity for humanempathy or connection."}, {"zh-tw": "沒人想談羞恥越不談感受越大鞏固羞恥的東西這種「我不夠好」的感受我想我們都經歷過「不夠徹底、不夠纖瘦」「不夠有錢、不夠漂亮、不夠聰明」「不夠有才」支撐這種", "en": "No one wants to talk about it, and the less you talk about it,the more you have it. What underpinned this shame,this \"I'm not good enough,\" -- which, we all know that feeling: \"I'm not blank enough.I'm not thin enough, rich enough, beautiful enough,smart enough, promoted enough.\" The thing that underpinned thiswas excruciating vulnerability."}, {"zh-tw": "極痛苦的脆弱感的是這種為了要有連結我們必須讓自己被看見真的被看見各位都知道，我恨脆弱", "en": "This idea of, in orderfor connection to happen, we have to allow ourselvesto be seen, really seen. And you know how I feelabout vulnerability. I hate vulnerability."}, {"zh-tw": "所以我想，這是我用量尺贏回來的機會我一定要搞懂這東西我要花一年的時間，破解羞恥我一定要了解脆弱是如何運作", "en": "And so I thought, this is my chanceto beat it back with my measuring stick. I'm going in, I'm goingto figure this stuff out, I'm going to spend a year,I'm going to totally deconstruct shame, I'm going to understandhow vulnerability works, and I'm going to outsmart it."}, {"zh-tw": "我要打敗它我準備好了，也很興奮各位也知道，結果沒有很好", "en": "So I was ready, and I was really excited. As you know,it's not going to turn out well."}, {"zh-tw": "你們都懂關於羞恥我可以講很多", "en": "You know this. So, I could tell you a lot about shame, but I'd have to borroweveryone else's time."}, {"zh-tw": "但會佔用到其他講者的時間我可以告訴你的是，研究最終這是我十年的研究所學到最重要的其中一件事我的一年變成六年數千個故事數百個面談，團體會晤", "en": "But here's what I can tell youthat it boils down to -- and this may be one of the most importantthings that I've ever learned in the decade of doing this research. My one year turned into six years: Thousands of stories, hundredsof long interviews, focus groups."}, {"zh-tw": "某階段還有人寄給我日記手札告訴我他們的故事六年間有數千筆數據我也大概弄懂了", "en": "At one point, people weresending me journal pages and sending me their stories -- thousands of pieces of data in six years. And I kind of got a handle on it."}, {"zh-tw": "我有點明白羞恥是什麼是怎麼運作的我寫了本書出版了個理論但有件事還是不對就是我將我訪問過的人分為兩組一組是認為自己有價值的人 --這也是核心的部份個人價值感 --這些人有很強的愛與歸屬感另一組是掙扎的人他們總想自己是否夠好", "en": "I kind of understood, this iswhat shame is, this is how it works. I wrote a book, I published a theory,but something was not okay -- and what it was is that, if I roughlytook the people I interviewed and divided them into people who reallyhave a sense of worthiness -- that's what this comes down to,a sense of worthiness -- they have a strong senseof love and belonging -- and folks who struggle for it, and folks who are always wonderingif they're good enough."}, {"zh-tw": "兩組間只有一個可變因素有強烈愛與歸屬感的人與掙扎的人之間只有一個可變因素這就是，那些有強烈愛與歸屬感的人", "en": "There was only one variable that separated the people who have a strong senseof love and belonging and the people who really struggle for it. And that was, the people who havea strong sense of love and belonging believe they're worthyof love and belonging."}, {"zh-tw": "相信他們是值得愛與歸屬的就這樣", "en": "That's it. They believe they're worthy."}, {"zh-tw": "他們相信這是值得的對我來說，困難的部份唯一讓我們無法連結的部份就是害怕我們不值得彼此連結這個在個人以及工作上來說我覺得我應該要更精確理解所以我將所有的訪談裡看得出個人價值感的案例拿出來", "en": "And to me, the hard part of the one thingthat keeps us out of connection is our fear that we're notworthy of connection, was something that,personally and professionally, I felt like I needed to understand better. So what I did is I tookall of the interviews where I saw worthiness,where I saw people living that way, and just looked at those."}, {"zh-tw": "只看這些人這些人有什麼共同點？我對辦公用品有點龜毛但這是另一個故事了我拿了個分類文件夾、一隻簽字筆我就想，這研究要怎麼稱呼?我想到的第一個字就是全心全意這些都是全心付出的人，以強烈價值感活著", "en": "What do these people have in common? I have a slight office supply addiction,but that's another talk. So I had a manila folder,and I had a Sharpie, and I was like, what am I goingto call this research? And the first words that cameto my mind were \"whole-hearted.\" These are whole-hearted people,living from this deep sense of worthiness."}, {"zh-tw": "所以我在資料夾上這樣寫並開始看我所找到的資料事實上我所做的是前四天都密集研究資料回到最初的訪問、故事、事件", "en": "So I wrote at the topof the manila folder, and I started looking at the data. In fact, I did it first in a four-day,very intensive data analysis, where I went back, pulled the interviews,the stories, pulled the incidents."}, {"zh-tw": "主題是什麼？模式是什麼？我老公帶孩子出遠門因為我整個廢寢忘食我狂寫資料進入我\"研究員模式\"", "en": "What's the theme? What's the pattern? My husband left town with the kids because I always go into thisJackson Pollock crazy thing, where I'm just writingand in my researcher mode. And so here's what I found."}, {"zh-tw": "我的研究結果是這樣的他們共有的是勇氣(courage)我想簡單解釋勇氣(courage)與勇敢(bravery)的不同", "en": "What they had in commonwas a sense of courage. And I want to separate courageand bravery for you for a minute."}, {"zh-tw": "勇氣最初的定義最早變成英語的時候是拉丁字源cor，表示\"心(heart)\"而它最初的定義就是全心全意講述關於你自己的故事所以這些人有著承認不完美", "en": "Courage, the originaldefinition of courage, when it first cameinto the English language -- it's from the Latin word \"cor,\"meaning \"heart\" -- and the original definition was to tellthe story of who you are with your whole heart. And so these folks had, very simply,the courage to be imperfect."}, {"zh-tw": "的勇氣他們有同情心對自己好之後對別人好因為，後來發現，你要對別人有同情心就一定要先對自己好最後，他們都有著連結這是困難的部份就是\"真實性\"的結果他們願意放下他們想成為的自己為了做真正的自己而為了與人連結", "en": "They had the compassion to be kindto themselves first and then to others, because, as it turns out, we can't practice compassionwith other people if we can't treat ourselves kindly. And the last was they had connection,and -- this was the hard part -- as a result of authenticity, they were willing to let goof who they thought they should be in order to be who they were,which you have to absolutely do that for connection."}, {"zh-tw": "就必須這麼做他們的另一個共通點是這個他們坦蕩的接受脆弱他們相信讓他們脆弱的", "en": "The other thing that they hadin common was this: They fully embraced vulnerability. They believed that what made themvulnerable made them beautiful."}, {"zh-tw": "會讓他們美麗他們並不是說脆弱是很自在的事也不是很痛心的事從我早期\"羞恥\"訪問中發現的他們認為脆弱是必須的", "en": "They didn't talk about vulnerabilitybeing comfortable, nor did they really talkabout it being excruciating -- as I had heard it earlierin the shame interviewing. They just talked about it being necessary."}, {"zh-tw": "他們談到願意先說「我愛你」願意去做那些", "en": "They talked about the willingnessto say, \"I love you\" first ... the willingness to do somethingwhere there are no guarantees ..."}, {"zh-tw": "不保證美好的事願意在乳房X光檢查後深呼吸等待醫生回電願意投入一場戀愛", "en": "the willingness to breathethrough waiting for the doctor to call after your mammogram. They're willing to investin a relationship that may or may not work out."}, {"zh-tw": "不論結果好不好他們認為這是很基本的", "en": "They thought this was fundamental. I personally thought it was betrayal."}, {"zh-tw": "我個人認為這是背叛因為我發了誓要做研究研究的定義就是控制和預測、研究現象就這麼簡單控制和預測所以我原本的任務控制和預測變成發現到人們都與脆弱一起生活", "en": "I could not believe I had pledgedallegiance to research, where our job -- you know, the definition of researchis to control and predict, to study phenomena for the explicitreason to control and predict. And now my mission to control and predict had turned up the answerthat the way to live is with vulnerability and to stop controlling and predicting."}, {"zh-tw": "並停止控制和預測後來導致我有點小崩潰應該是這樣", "en": "This led to a little breakdown -- -- which actually looked more like this. And it did."}, {"zh-tw": "沒錯我稱為崩潰，我心理醫師稱為心靈覺醒心靈覺醒好聽多了不過我確定就是崩潰沒錯", "en": "I call it a breakdown; my therapistcalls it a spiritual awakening. A spiritual awakeningsounds better than breakdown, but I assure you, it was a breakdown."}, {"zh-tw": "所以我把工作放下，去找心理醫師告訴你吧，當你打電話給朋友並問他們：「我想我需要看心理醫生了，你有建議誰嗎？」的時候", "en": "And I had to put my data awayand go find a therapist. Let me tell you something:you know who you are when you call your friends and say,\"I think I need to see somebody."}, {"zh-tw": "就瞭解自己是誰了我五個朋友都說「真慶幸我不是你心理醫師」我就說：「你這什麼意思？」他們就說：「我只是說說」「別帶你的量尺就對了」好吧我找到了個醫師", "en": "Do you have any recommendations?\" Because about fiveof my friends were like, \"Wooo, I wouldn't wantto be your therapist.\" I was like, \"What does that mean?\" And they're like,\"I'm just saying, you know. Don't bring your measuring stick.\" I was like, \"Okay.\" So I found a therapist."}, {"zh-tw": "我第一次與Diana的會診我帶上我的清單就是全心全意訪問清單，並坐下她說：「你好嗎？」我說：「我很好阿」她說：「你怎麼了？」我的心理醫師也看心理醫師因為每個人都有心事然後他們胡扯的功力都很厲害", "en": "My first meeting with her, Diana -- I brought in my list of the waythe whole-hearted live, and I sat down. And she said, \"How are you?\" And I said, \"I'm great. I'm okay.\" She said, \"What's going on?\" And this is a therapistwho sees therapists, because we have to go to those,because their B.S. meters are good."}, {"zh-tw": "然後我說「是這樣的，我在掙扎」她說：「掙扎什麼？」我說：「我跟脆弱槓上了」「我知道脆弱是丟臉和害怕」「的核心」「為了自我價值的掙扎」「但似乎也孕育出了」「喜悅、創造力」", "en": "And so I said, \"Here's the thing,I'm struggling.\" And she said, \"What's the struggle?\" And I said, \"Well, I havea vulnerability issue.

So she goes like this."}, {"zh-tw": "我問：「很糟吧？」她答：「不好也不壞啦」「不就這樣」我說：「天哪，我完了」是也不是啦", "en": "And then I said, \"It's bad, right?\" And she said, \"It's neither good nor bad.\" \"It just is what it is.\" And I said, \"Oh my God,this is going to suck.\" And it did, and it didn't.

I lost the fight, but probably won my life back."}, {"zh-tw": "但卻贏了我的生活所以我繼續這個研究花了幾年時間試著搞清楚這些全心全意的人他們所做出的選擇他們怎麼應付脆弱感的為什麼我們如此掙扎？只有我與脆弱掙扎嗎？", "en": "And so then I went back into the research and spent the next couple of years really trying to understandwhat they, the whole-hearted, what choices they were making,and what we are doing with vulnerability.
