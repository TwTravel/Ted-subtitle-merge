All too often, execution day was more like a carnivalthan a solemn ceremony.", "en": " 刀掉下來, 頭掉進一個籃子裡, 之後立即消失在人們視線中, 然後人們開始要求,\"還我絞刑台, 還我木質絞刑台\" 歐洲及美國痛苦的公眾處決的結束 是為了對犯人更加人道 但同時也是因為人們堅決拒絕 做他們應做的事情 處決日經常更像一個嘉年華會 而非嚴肅的儀式"}, {"zh-tw": " Today, a public judicial executionin Europe or America is unthinkable, but there are other scenariosthat should make us cautious about thinkingthat things are different now and we don't behave like that anymore. Take, for example,the incidents of suicide baiting.", "en": " 在今天的歐洲以及美國,公眾執法是無法想像的 但是, 仍有其他可能發生的情況,我們應該謹慎思考 因為事情跟以前不一樣, 而我們也不像以前那樣表現了 舉自殺誘導為例,"}, {"zh-tw": " This is when a crowd gathers to watch a person who has climbedto the top of a public building in order to kill themselves, and people in the crowd shout and jeer, \"Get on with it!

Our activities onlineare often contrasted with real life, as though the things we do onlineare somehow less real.", "en": " 這與其他人、這個事件 之間的脫離感 看似成為了解我們俱有能夠觀看那些影片能力的鑰匙 網路透過很多管道 創造了脫離感 而這似乎已經腐蝕了個人的道德責任 我們的線上活動往往對比出真實世界 儘管我們在網路上做的事不那麼真實"}, {"zh-tw": " We feel less accountable for our actions when we interact online. There's a sense of anonymity,a sense of invisibility, so we feel less accountablefor our behavior.", "en": " 當我們在網路上互動的時候, 我們似乎可以對我們的行為負少一點的責任 因為在網路上的一切都是匿名且看不見的 所以我們對我們在網路上的行為總是覺得不需負責"}, {"zh-tw": " The Internet also makes it far easierto stumble upon things inadvertently, things that we would usually avoidin everyday life.

When the victim of a decapitationis bound and defenseless, he or she essentially becomesa pawn in their killer's show.", "en": " 相反的, 我們充滿了那種像殺人犯一樣被看見的渴望 當受害者註定被斬首而無法反抗或自我防衛 他本質上就成了殺人犯這場表演中的棋子"}, {"zh-tw": " Unlike a trophy headthat's taken in battle, that represents the luck and skillit takes to win a fight, when a beheading is staged, when it's essentially a piece of theater, the power comes from the receptionthe killer receives as he performs. In other words, watchingis very much part of the event.", "en": " 不像在戰役中的戰利品 象徵著藉由幸運及技巧才獲得的勝利 當斬首正在上演 當這本質上是在戲院上映的一個作品 那股力量,來自殺人犯表演時所獲得的能量 換句話來說,觀看其實占這事件中非常大部分"}, {"zh-tw": " The event no longer takes placein a single location at a certain point in time as it used toand as it may still appear to.

While they installfor the next performance, I want to ask you the questionthat probably many here have, which is how did youget interested in this topic? Frances Larson: I used to work at a museum called the Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford, which was famous for its displayof shrunken heads from South America.

So I wanted to kind of twist it roundand say, \"Let's look at us.\" We're looking through the glass caseat these shrunken heads.", "en": " 我開始研究頭蓋骨的搜集 但人們來這裡,看這段殘暴,原始且野蠻的文化時 幾乎只透過幻想和自我創造 而非仔細了解他們正在看的 這讓我覺得很諷刺 而所有這些很多的,我的意思是 在我們博物館中橫越歐美成千成百的頭骨 有點像是維護著我們對理性科學和啓蒙思想的追逐 所以, 我想要換個面向然後說我們來看看我們自己 我們正透過玻璃櫥窗看這些皺縮頭骨"}, {"zh-tw": " Let's look at our own history and our owncultural fascination with these things.
