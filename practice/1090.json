How do we take what those teacherswere doing to its natural conclusion? And so, what I'm showing over here, these are actual exercises that I started writing for my cousins. The ones I startedwere much more primitive."}, {"zh-tw": "現在的比較好用這個範例所展現的是，我們讓你做許多題目直到你理解了這個概念直到你連續答對十題", "en": "This is a more competent version of it.

You get hints, the actualsteps for that problem, if you don't know how to do it."}, {"zh-tw": "這個範例看上去很簡單：十題，然後繼續它和現在的教室有所不同", "en": "The paradigm here seemslike a very simple thing: 10 in a row, you move on.

Maybe they didn't know what happens whenyou raise something to the zeroth power. Then you build on thatin the next concept."}, {"zh-tw": "那就像是想像你在學騎腳踏車我事先和你講解然後把腳踏車給你兩個禮拜兩個禮拜後我回來說“我看看，你左轉有問題", "en": "That's analogous to --imagine learning to ride a bicycle.

Stay on that bicycle.Fall off that bicycle."}, {"zh-tw": "直到你真正學會為止傳統的模式懲罰學生的嘗試和失敗它不期待你完全理解", "en": "Do it as long as necessary,until you have mastery.

You can go to the site right now, it's all free,not trying to sell anything."}, {"zh-tw": "重點是他們全都包含在這知識地圖裡上面那個最高的結是個位數加法像一加一等於二", "en": "But the general idea is that they allfit into this knowledge map. That top node right there,that's literally single-digit addition, it's like one plus one is equal to two."}, {"zh-tw": "它的用法是，一旦你連續答對十題你就會進階到下一個課題如果你這張知識地圖持續前進便會進入更進階的演算", "en": "The paradigm is, once you get10 in a row on that, it keeps forwarding youto more and more advanced modules. Further down the knowledge map, we're getting into moreadvanced arithmetic."}, {"zh-tw": "再往下去，你就會到前代數和早期代數再下去，就有代數一", "en": "Further down, you start gettinginto pre-algebra and early algebra. Further down, you start gettinginto algebra one, algebra two, a little bit of precalculus."}, {"zh-tw": "一些早期微積分我們的想法是，我們可以教所有東西至少那些所有可以教的東西在這個框架下你可以想像 － 這是我們現在在做的 －從這個知識地圖你有邏輯、寫電腦程式文法、遺傳學中心思想是如果你懂了這個和那個", "en": "And the idea is, from this we canactually teach everything -- well, everything that can be taughtin this type of a framework. So you can imagine -- and thisis what we are working on -- from this knowledge map, you havelogic, you have computer programming, you have grammar, you have genetics, all based off of that core of,if you know this and that, now you're ready for this next concept."}, {"zh-tw": "就已經準備好理解下一個概念了當然你可以自己學但是我鼓勵家長和孩子一起我也鼓勵在場的個位觀眾自己試試可以改變晚餐桌上的一些習慣", "en": "Now that can work wellfor an individual learner, and I encourage youto do it with your kids, but I also encourage everyonein the audience to do it yourself. It'll change what happensat the dinner table."}, {"zh-tw": "但我們想做的是應用這些老師寫信給我的內容來改變現在的教育。我現在要給你看的是從洛杉磯 Los Altos 學區來的數據他們帶兩班五年級和兩班七年級學生完全遺棄他們過去的數學課程", "en": "But what we want to do is use the natural conclusionof the flipping of the classroom that those early teachershad emailed me about. And so what I'm showing you here, this is data from a pilotin the Los Altos school district, where they took two fifth-grade classesand two seventh-grade classes, and completely guttedtheir old math curriculum."}, {"zh-tw": "這些學生不用課本不用千篇一律的課堂解說他們加入 Khan 學院用半節課來用這套軟體", "en": "These kids aren't using textbooks,or getting one-size-fits-all lectures. They're doing Khan Academy, that software,for roughly half of their math class."}, {"zh-tw": "我必須要說清楚，我們不是說這是完整的數學教育它所做的是 － 就像在 Los Atlos 所做的一樣它讓你有自由時間這是針對問題解答確定你知道如何在這些方程式系統中來去自如你還有時間可以模擬、玩遊戲學機械、做機器人用影子估算山究竟有多高", "en": "I want to be clear: we don't view thisas a complete math education. What it does is -- this iswhat's happening in Los Altos -- it frees up time --it's the blocking and tackling, making sure you know how to movethrough a system of equations, and it frees up timefor the simulations, for the games, for the mechanics, for the robot-building, for the estimating how highthat hill is based on its shadow."}, {"zh-tw": "這個模式是，老師走進教室每個學生用自己的速度學習這是 Los Atlos 學區的測量表數據在這裡一目瞭然每一列是一個學生", "en": "And so the paradigm isthe teacher walks in every day, every kid works at their own pace -- this is actually a live dashboardfrom the Los Altos school district -- and they look at this dashboard. Every row is a student."}, {"zh-tw": "每一行是一個概念綠色代表這個學生已經通過了", "en": "Every column is one of those concepts. Green means the student'salready proficient."}, {"zh-tw": "藍色代表他們還在繼續學習 － 不用擔心紅色代表他們有困難了", "en": "Blue means they're workingon it -- no need to worry. Red means they're stuck."}, {"zh-tw": "而教師所該做的不過是“讓我看看這些紅色的學生遇見了甚麼困難”更好的是“讓我把這些綠色的學生那些已經學會的學生送到前線教導他們的同學。”這是以數據為主的我們不希望老師去介入或問學生奇怪的問題像“你有甚麼不懂的嗎？”或“你到底懂甚麼？”等等的。我們的軟體是用數據來幫助這些老師這些在金融、市場或製造業都有的真實數據這些老師可以由此看出他們的學生有甚麼困難讓他們的互動更有效率", "en": "And what the teacher doesis literally just say, \"Let me intervene on the red kids.\" Or even better, \"Let me getone of the green kids, who are already proficientin that concept, to be the first line of attack,and actually tutor their peer.\" Now, I come from a verydata-centric reality, so we don't want that teacherto even go and intervene and have to ask the kid awkward questions: \"What don't you understand? What doyou understand?\" and all the rest. So our paradigm is to arm teacherswith as much data as possible -- data that, in any otherfield, is expected, in finance, marketing, manufacturing -- so the teachers can diagnosewhat's wrong with the students so they can make their interactionas productive as possible."}, {"zh-tw": "現在這些老師知道他們的學生都做了些甚麼他們一天花了多少時間、看了多少影片他們甚麼時候暫停、停止了甚麼影片他們做了甚麼習題他們的學習重心是甚麼？外面的圈顯示他們專注於那些習題裡面的圈顯示他們看了甚麼影片", "en": "Now teachers know exactlywhat the students have been up to, how long they've spent each day,what videos they've watched, when did they pause the videos,what did they stop watching, what exercises are they using,what have they focused on? The outer circle showswhat exercises they were focused on. The inner circle showsthe videos they're focused on."}, {"zh-tw": "然後數據變得更仔細你可以看到學生做對和做錯的問題紅色是錯了，藍色是對了", "en": "The data gets pretty granular, so you can see the exact problemsthe student got right or wrong. Red is wrong, blue is right."}, {"zh-tw": "左邊的問題是學生第一個嘗試的問題他們在這裡看影片", "en": "The leftmost question is the first onethe student attempted. They watched the video over there."}, {"zh-tw": "然後終於，他們答對了十個問題就像你可以看到他們慢慢靠向最後那十個問題", "en": "And you can see, eventuallythey were able to get 10 in a row. It's almost like you can see themlearning over those last 10 problems."}, {"zh-tw": "他們的速度更快了高度是他們的答題時間當你談到自主學習大家都聽得懂 － 因材施教但親眼教室看到時還是很令人吃驚", "en": "They also got faster -- the heightis how long it took them. When you talk about self-paced learning,it makes sense for everyone -- in education-speak,\"differentiated learning\" -- but it's kind of crazy, what happenswhen you see it in a classroom."}, {"zh-tw": "因為每一次在每一個我們實驗的課堂一次又一次，五天下來一群孩子往前直衝一群孩子較為緩慢在過去的模式，如果你用以前的衡量方法你會說“這些是聰明的孩子，這些是遲緩的孩子", "en": "Because every time we've done this,in every classroom we've done, over and over again,if you go five days into it, there's a group of kids who've raced ahead and a group who are a little bit slower.

Maybe we should put themin different classes.\" But when you let studentswork at their own pace -- we see it over and over again -- you see students who tooka little bit extra time on one concept or the other, but once they get through that concept, they just race ahead."}, {"zh-tw": "六個禮拜前覺得緩慢的學生現在你會覺得他們很聰明我們真的一次又一次地看見這種狀況", "en": "And so the same kids that youthought were slow six weeks ago, you now would think are gifted.

Now as valuable as something like this isin a district like Los Altos, our goal is to use technology to humanize, not just in Los Altos,but on a global scale, what's happening in education."}, {"zh-tw": "事實上，這讓我們看見一些有趣的點許多有關人性教育的討論都注重老師和學生的比例上", "en": "And that brings up an interesting point. A lot of the effortin humanizing the classroom is focused on student-to-teacher ratios."}, {"zh-tw": "在我們看來，更有效的衡量方法應該是以學生得到了老師多少時間作為衡量在傳統模式裡，老師大部分的時間都在講課、改作業、打分數", "en": "In our mind, the relevant metric is: student-to-valuable-human-time-with-the-teacher ratio. So in a traditional model,most of the teacher's time is spent doing lecturesand grading and whatnot."}, {"zh-tw": "或許只有百分之五的時間真的和學生一起相處現在他們可以有百分百的注意力", "en": "Maybe five percent of their timeis sitting next to students and working with them. Now, 100 percent of their time is."}, {"zh-tw": "我要再說一次，科技不但讓課堂更有趣也讓課堂更人性至少增加五到十倍就像在 Los Altos 所呈現的想像這會對那些因為羞於承認而不敢回去學習的成年學生帶來多大的幫助", "en": "So once again, using technology,not just flipping the classroom, you're humanizingthe classroom, I'd argue, by a factor of five or 10.
