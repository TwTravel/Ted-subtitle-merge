So when we talk about elections, we in established democracies,we know what we're talking about.", "en": " 偉大的哲人亞里士多德說過： 如果一件事物不存在，它就沒有名字。 如果一件事物沒有名字， 它就不存在。 所以當我們談論選舉的時候， 我們的國家採用了民主制，所以知道民主是什麼。"}, {"zh-tw": " We've got the words.We have the vocabulary. We know what a polling station is.", "en": " 我們有相關的單字、相關的詞彙。 我們知道什麼是投票站。"}, {"zh-tw": " We know what a ballot paper is. But what about countrieswhere democracy doesn't exist, countries where there areno words to describe the concepts that underpin a democratic society? I work in the fieldof electoral assistance, so that's to say we assist emerging democracies to organize what is often their first elections.", "en": " 我們知道什麼是選票。 但在那些非民主國家， 不存在可以形容「民主社會」這個概念的詞語時， 該怎麼辦呢？ 我從事選舉援助工作， 也就是說， 我們幫助新興的民主國家組織選舉， 通常是第一次選舉。"}, {"zh-tw": " When people ask me what I do, quite often I get this answer. \"Oh, so you're one of these peoplewho goes around the world imposing Western democracyon countries that can't handle it.\" Well, the United Nationsdoes not impose anything on anybody.", "en": " 當人們問起我的工作時， 我通常會得到這個回答， 「喔！你就是那些到世界各地， 到不能承受民主的國家，去強行實施西方民主制的人。」 呃……聯合國不強迫任何人做任何事，"}, {"zh-tw": " It really doesn't, and also, what we do is firmly anchored in the 1948Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article 21, that says that everybody should have the rightto choose who governs them. So that's the basis of the work.", "en": " 真的不。 而且，我們所做的 是篤守 1948《世界人權宣言》的 第二十一條： 人人有選擇代表參與治理本國的權利。 這是我們工作的基石。"}, {"zh-tw": " I specialize in public outreach. What does that mean? Another jargon.", "en": " 我從事公眾推廣顧問。 這是什麼意思呢？聽起來又是個術語。"}, {"zh-tw": " It actually meansdesigning information campaigns so that candidates and voters who have never had the opportunityto participate or to vote understand where, when, how to register; where, when, how to vote; why, why it is important to take part. So I'll probably devise a specificcampaign to reach out to women to make sure that they can take part, that they can be part of the process.", "en": " 這其實是設計圖像去表達複雜信息。 這使從來沒有機會參與 或投票的候選人和選民， 明白在何時何地註冊，如何註冊； 瞭解在何時何地投票，如何投票； 知道參與選舉是多麼的重要。 我可能會設計針對女性的活動， 保證女性可以參與其中， 參與整個過程。"}, {"zh-tw": " Young people as well.

We try to reach everybody.", "en": " 行動不便的人， 我們嘗試去幫助每一個人。"}, {"zh-tw": " And it's not always easy,because very often in this work, I've noticed now over the yearsthat I've been doing it that words are lacking, and so what do you do?

It was, but on the other hand,explaining two elections instead of one was even more complicated.", "en": " 因為物流條件太差了， 所以一天辦兩場會更有效率。 的確是比較高效。 但是在另一方面，解釋兩場選舉 比解釋一場難多了。"}, {"zh-tw": " So we used a lot of images, and when it came to the actual ballot, we had problems, becauseso many people wanted to take part, we had 300 candidates for 52 seats in the Wolesi Jirga,which is the parliamentary elections.

This means \"to notice\"in a passive sort of sense, as in, \"I noticedhe was wearing a light blue shirt.\" Did I go and check whetherthe shirt was light blue or not? That is the role of an election observer.", "en": " 我那時和選舉委員會坐在一起， 我們在談選舉的不同方面。 我聽到他們用一些我從未聽過的詞彙。 我曾與伊拉克人、約旦人、埃及人一起工作， 然後突然間他們就開始使用這些詞彙。 我就想：“這真是奇怪”。 但他們真正想表達的是「觀察員」。 我們正在討論選舉的觀察員。 選舉委員們用阿拉伯語討論著「mulahiz」。 它的意思接近被動語氣的「注意」。 例如：「我注意到他穿著一件淡藍色的襯衫。」 我是不是該檢查他的襯衫真的是淡藍色的？ 這就是選舉觀察員的角色。"}, {"zh-tw": " It's very active, it's governedby all kinds of treaties, and it has gotthat control function in it.

So I thought, three wordsfor one concept. This is not good.", "en": " 但這也不太對， 因為我們已經有使用中、且為人接受的詞， 那就是「muraqib」，意思是「監控員」。 類似控制的概念。 所以我就想，三個單詞，一個概念，這可不太好。"}, {"zh-tw": " And with our colleagues,we thought perhaps it's our role to actually help make surethat the words are understood and actually create a work of reference that could be used across the Arab region. And that's what we did.", "en": " 和同事討論後，我們認為我們的角色或許是 幫助他們確切地理解這些單詞， 並建立一份參考資料， 用於阿拉伯語地區。 所以我們就這麼做了。"}, {"zh-tw": " So together with these colleagues, we launched the \"Arabic Lexiconof Electoral Terminology,\" and we workedin eight different countries. It meant actually defining 481 terms which formed the basisof everything you need to know if you're going to organizea democratic election.", "en": " 我和這些同事發起了 「阿拉伯語選舉標準術語」項目， 並在八個不同的國家使用。 實際上，我們定義了 481 個詞語， 如果你想辦場民主選舉， 所有基本知識都囊括其中。"}, {"zh-tw": " And we defined these terms, and we worked with the Arab colleagues and came to an agreementabout what would be the appropriate word to use in Arabic. Because the Arabic language is very rich,and that's part of the problem.", "en": " 我們定義了這些詞彙， 也和阿拉伯同事一起工作， 進而達成了適用於阿拉伯世界 的詞彙共識。 阿拉伯語的詞彙很豐富，但那正是問題所在。"}, {"zh-tw": " But there are 22 countriesthat speak Arabic, and they use modern standard Arabic, which is the Arabicthat is used across the whole region in newspapers and broadcasts, but of course, then from one countryto the next in day to day language and use it varies -- dialect, colloquialisms, etc. So that was anotheradded layer of complication.", "en": " 因為有 22 個國家使用阿拉伯語。 雖然他們使用的都是標準現代阿拉伯語， 就是在整個中東地區通用的阿拉伯語， 也用在報紙和廣播中。 但當然，隨著國家間的日常用語有所改變， 阿拉伯語就開始分化了——方言、俗語等等。 這構成了另一道障礙。"}, {"zh-tw": " So in one sense you had the problem that language wasn'tfully ripe, if you like, neologisms were coming up,new expressions. And so we defined all these terms, and then we hadeight correspondents in the region.", "en": " 在這個情況下有個問題： 語言尚未完全成熟； 新詞彙和表達方式卻蜂擁而來， 所以我們定義了這些詞彙， 我們在這些地區有八位通訊作者。"}, {"zh-tw": " We submitted the draft to them, they responded back to us. \"Yes, we understand the definition.", "en": " 我們把詞彙表的草稿交給他們， 他們就回覆我們： 「是的，我們明白這些定義。"}, {"zh-tw": " We agree with it, but this is what we say in our country.\" Because we were not goingto harmonize or force harmonization. We were trying to facilitateunderstanding among people.", "en": " 我們贊同這個說法， 但這是我們國家的說法。」 因為我們不打算去協調也不準備強制協調， 我們就只能嘗試去促進人與人之間的相互理解，"}, {"zh-tw": " So in yellow, you seethe different expressions in use in the various countries. So this, I'm happy to say,it took three years to produce this because we also finalized the draftand took it actually into the field, sat with the election commissionsin all these different countries, debated and defined and refined the draft, and finally published itin November 2014 in Cairo.", "en": " 所以在黃色的部分，你們能看見， 不同國家的使用者所使用的各種表達方式。 因此，我很高興告訴各位，我們花了三年時間 寫出最終的草稿，放到現實情境中， 與各國的選舉委員會坐在一起， 爭論、定義、且精鍊這些草稿， 最後在 2014 年 11 月於開羅出版。"}, {"zh-tw": " And it's gone a long way.We published 10,000 copies. To date, there's about 3,000 downloadsoff the internet in PDF form.", "en": " 這是漫長的旅程。我們出版了一萬份列印本。 時至今日，PDF 的下載量約有三千次。"}, {"zh-tw": " I heard just recently from a colleaguethat they've taken it up in Somalia. They're going to producea version of this in Somalia, because there's nothing in Somalia at all.", "en": " 我最近剛從一個同事那邊聽說，他們要把這份文件帶到索馬利亞， 他們將製作索馬利亞的版本。 因為目前索馬利亞什麼都沒有。"}, {"zh-tw": " So that's very good to know. And this newly formed Arab Organizationfor Electoral Management Bodies, which is trying to professionalize how elections are run in the region, they're using it as well.", "en": " 這聽起來不錯吧。 有個新成立的「阿拉伯選舉管理組織」， 希望讓阿拉伯世界 所舉辦的選舉更為專業， 他們已開始使用這份文件。"}, {"zh-tw": " And the Arab League have nowbuilt up a pan-Arab observation unit, and they're using it. So that's all really good.", "en": " 阿拉伯聯盟現在也建立了「泛阿拉伯觀察中心」， 他們也在使用這份文件。 這聽起來都很棒。"}, {"zh-tw": " However, this work of referenceis quite high-pitched. It's complex, and a lot of the termsare quite technical, so the average person probably doesn'tneed to know at least a third of it.", "en": " 然而，這個框架比較陽春白雪。 它很複雜，其中有很多專業詞彙。 對一般人來說，有大概三分之一的詞彙都不用認識。"}, {"zh-tw": " But the people of the Middle East have been deprived of any formof what we know as civic education. It's part of our curriculum at school.", "en": " 但是在中東地區的人們， 他們被剝奪了我們所理解的文明教育。 那些是我們學校課程中的一部分，"}, {"zh-tw": " It doesn't really existin that part of the world, and I feel it's reallythe right of everybody to know how these things work. And it's a good thing to think aboutproducing a work of reference for the average person, and bearing in mind that now we have a basis to work with, but also we have technology, so we can reach out using telephone apps, video, animation.", "en": " 但在那個世界是不存在的。 而我認為每個人都有權利 知道選舉是如何運作的。 製作一份參考文件，讓普通人理解， 是很棒的一件事。 雖然我們已經有了 這樣一份基礎文件， 但別忘了，我們還有科技， 我們可以使用手機軟體、視頻、動畫， 接觸到更多的人。"}, {"zh-tw": " There's all sorts of toolsthat can be used now to communicate these ideas to people for the first time in their own language. We hear a lot of miseryabout the Middle East.", "en": " 我們現在有各式各樣的工具 去把這些觀點用人們自己的語言 第一次傳遞給他們。 我們聽說了中東地區人們很多的痛苦。"}, {"zh-tw": " We hear the chaos of war.We hear terrorism.
