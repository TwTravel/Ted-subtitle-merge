One is the gap in opportunity -- this gap that President Clinton last night called uneven, unfair and unsustainable -- and, out of that, comes poverty and illiteracy and disease and all these evils that we see around us.", "en": " 這幾天裡 我們聽了許多演講 愛德威爾森的還有詹姆士納西維的照片 我想我們都了解我們還得走多遠的路 才能成為新世代的人類 而我喜歡稱之為『人類2.0』 這存在我們彼此之間 用來終結我想是 現今最大的兩個災難 一個是機會不均的鴻溝 此鴻溝是昨晚柯林頓總統所談到的 是不公不義,無法永續發展的 還有貧窮,文盲與疾病 以及在我們周遭的小奸小惡"}, {"zh-tw": " But perhaps the other, bigger gap is what we call the hope gap.

Bet on good people doing good things.\" And that really resonated with me.", "en": " 他回道: 讓有志之士有機會做好事吧 讓有志之士做好事 我覺得這真的很有道理"}, {"zh-tw": " I started a foundation to bet on these good people doing good things. These leading, innovative, nonprofit folks, who are using business skills in a very leveraged way to solve social problems.", "en": " 我成立一個基金會 來讓這些有志之士發揮其才 這些具有創新思維的優秀的社會工作者 運用極具影響力的管理能力 來解決社會問題"}, {"zh-tw": " People today we call social entrepreneurs. And to put a face on it, people like Muhammad Yunus, who started the Grameen Bank, has lifted 100 million people plus out of poverty around the world, won the Nobel Peace Prize.", "en": " 今天我們稱他們為社會企業家 例如像穆罕默德尤努斯 一手成立鄉村銀行 他幫助了全世界約一億人口脫離貧窮 並因此獲得諾貝爾和平獎的殊榮"}, {"zh-tw": " But there's also a lot of people that you don't know. Folks like Ann Cotton, who started a group called CAMFED in Africa, because she felt girls' education was lagging.", "en": " 但還有更多默默耕耘的無名英雄 像是安卡登, 於非洲成立一個名叫CAMFED的社會團體 她有感於女性受教育的情形未見改善"}, {"zh-tw": " And she started it about 10 years ago, and today, she educates over a quarter million African girls. And somebody like Dr. Victoria Hale, who started the world's first nonprofit pharmaceutical company, and whose first drug will be fighting visceral leishmaniasis, also known as black fever.", "en": " 所以她於10年前成立該組織 而到今天, 在非洲她讓超過25萬名女孩有機會受教育 而另外像是維多利亞海爾教授 成立全世界第一個非營利藥廠 該公司研發的第一種藥物是用來治療內臟利甚曼病 又名黑熱病"}, {"zh-tw": " And by 2010, she hopes to eliminate this disease, which is really a scourge in the developing world. And so this is one way to bet on good people doing good things.", "en": " 她希望到2010年,能成功消滅該疾病 此疾病在發展中國家是一大禍害 所以她的善舉也是讓有志之士 做好事的其中一個例子"}, {"zh-tw": " And a lot of this comes together in a philosophy of change that I find really is powerful. It's what we call, \"Invest, connect and celebrate.\" And invest: if you see good people doing good things, invest in them. Invest in their organizations, or in business. Invest in these folks.", "en": " 當然還有很多是與關於改變的思維有所相關的 我覺得這個力量真的很強大 也就是我們稱之為『投資,連結, 發揚光大』 投資- 如果你看到有能力的人對這社會做出貢獻 好好投資在他們身上. 投資他們所屬的組織 或其企業. 好好投資在這些人身上"}, {"zh-tw": " Connecting them together through conferences -- like a TED -- brings so many powerful connections, or through the World Forum on Social Entrepreneurship that my foundation does at Oxford every year. And celebrate them: tell their stories, because not only are there good people doing good work, but their stories can help close these gaps of hope.", "en": " 並利用研討會等活動來讓這些人連結起來 例如像是TED, 連結了許多驚人的力量 或是透過社會企業高峰會 我的基金會每年都會在牛津舉辦一次 將其發揚光大, 讚頌他們的故事 因為這不僅僅只是有能力的人在做好事 他們的故事同樣也能幫助銜接希望缺口"}, {"zh-tw": " And it was this last part of the mission, the celebrate part, that really got me back to thinking when I was a kid and wanted to tell stories to get people involved in the issues that affect us all. And a light bulb went off, which was, first, that I didn't actually have to do the writing myself, I could find writers.", "en": " 這就是這任務的最後一個階段, 發揚的部份 這也讓我回想到當我還是個小孩時 想要說故事給大家聽,讓大家都能親身參與 影響我們全體的議題之中 突然靈光乍現 第一, 我發現我其實不需靠自己來寫這些故事. 我可以找專業作家"}, {"zh-tw": " And then the next light bulb was, better than just writing, what about film and TV, to get out to people in a big way? And I thought about the films that inspired me, films like \"Gandhi\" and \"Schindler's List.\" And I wondered who was doing these kinds of films today. And there really wasn't a specific company that was focused on the public interest.", "en": " 然後我又想到還有比寫作更好的方式 我何不來製作電影及電視, 這不是更能影響大眾嗎? 所以我開始想有哪些電影激勵了我 像『甘地』還有『辛德勒的名單』等電影 我開始想現在有沒有哪個公司在製作類似這類電影 後來發現其實並沒有特定的公司 在製作關注社會議題的電影"}, {"zh-tw": " So, in 2003, I started to make my way around Los Angeles to talk about the idea of a pro-social media company and I was met with a lot of encouragement. One of the lines of encouragement that I heard over and over was, \"The streets of Hollywood are littered with the carcasses of people like you, who think you're going to come to this town and make movies.\" And then of course, there was the other adage.", "en": " 所以在2003年, 我開始跑去洛杉磯 去詢問成立關注社會議題的媒體公司的可能性 當時我得到了不少鼓勵 其中一句鼓勵的話 我聽了好幾次 『好萊塢的街上全是像你這種人』 『以為你來到這,就可以拍電影』 當然也有其他的名言"}, {"zh-tw": " \"The surest way to become a millionaire is to start by being a billionaire and go into the movie business.\" Undeterred, in January of 2004, I started Participant Productions with the vision to be a global media company focused on the public interest. And our mission is to produce entertainment that creates and inspires social change.", "en": " 『要成為百萬富翁最保險的辦法』 『就是億萬富翁去搞電影』 但在毫不屈服的情況下, 我在2004年1月成立了參與者製作公司 以期成為世界性的媒體公司 並將焦點關注於社會議題上 我們的任務是提供能改變社會 與啟發人心的娛樂"}, {"zh-tw": " And we don't just want people to see our movies and say, that was fun, and forget about it. We want them to actually get involved in the issues.", "en": " 我們不想讓大家來看我們的電影 只覺得這電影很有趣, 就沒了 我們希望大家能真正的去在乎這些議題"}, {"zh-tw": " In 2005, we launched our first slate of films, \"Murder Ball,\" \"North Country,\" \"Syriana\" and \"Good Night and Good Luck.\" And much to my surprise, they were noticed. We ended up with 11 Oscar nominations for these films.", "en": " 2005年, 我們首度推出一系列的電影 有『輪椅上的競技』,『北國性騷擾』與『諜對諜』 以及『晚安，祝你好運』 令人驚訝的是,這些電影都被注意到了 最後我們得到了11項奧斯卡提名"}, {"zh-tw": " And it turned out to be a pretty good year for this guy. Perhaps more importantly, tens of thousands of people joined the advocacy programs and the activism programs that we created to go around the movies.", "en": " 而且讓這個男人過了非常愉快的一年 也許更重要的是 有幾萬人投身參加倡導計畫活動 以及社會活動 也就是我們希望電影所能宣導的意義"}, {"zh-tw": " And we had an online component of that, our community sect called Participate.net. But with our social sector partners, like the ACLU and PBS and the Sierra Club and the NRDC, once people saw the film, there was actually something they could do to make a difference.", "en": " 我們有一個網站, 隸屬於我們組織的一部分 名叫Participate.net 有我們的社會組織夥伴, 像是美國公民自由聯盟與公共電視網 環保團體Sierra Club以及美國自然資源保護委員會, 一旦人們看了電影 他們就可以立即起身行動, 為世界做出改變"}, {"zh-tw": " One of these films in particular, called \"North Country,\" was actually kind of a box office disaster. But it was a film that starred Charlize Theron and it was about women's rights, women's empowerment, domestic violence and so on.", "en": " 其中特別是『北國性騷擾』一片 其實算是票房災難 這部電影是由莎莉賽隆所主演 是在講述關於女性的權益與自主權 家暴等等的議題"}, {"zh-tw": " And we released the film at the same time that the Congress was debating the renewal of the Violence Against Women Act. And with screenings on the Hill, and discussions, and with our social sector partners, like the National Organization of Women, the film was widely credited with influencing the successful renewal of the act.", "en": " 電影推出的同時 眾議院當時正在重新審議婦女暴力法案 隨著電影在議會放映與後續的討論 還有我們的社會組織夥伴 像是國家婦女組織的幫助 這部電影受到廣大的好評 因為成功影響了婦女暴力法案的通過"}, {"zh-tw": " And that to me, spoke volumes, because it's -- the film started about a true-life story about a woman who was harassed, sued her employer, led to a landmark case that led to the Equal Opportunity Act, and the Violence Against Women Act and others. And then the movie about this person doing these things, then led to this greater renewal.", "en": " 而且這對我來說,道盡了一切, 因為這是 一部描述真實故事的電影 關於一位受到侵犯的女性, 挺身控告她的上司 之後成為一個標示的案例, 影響了平等法案 以及婦女暴力法案等等 電影就是在講述關於這位女性的努力作為 後來產生了巨大的影響"}, {"zh-tw": " And so again, it goes back to betting on good people doing good things. Speaking of which, our fellow TEDster, Al -- I first saw Al do his slide show presentation on global warming in May of 2005.", "en": " 所以, 這又回到 讓有志之士做好事 說到這個, 我們的TED講者高爾 我第一次看到高爾在做地球暖化演講 是在2005年的5月"}, {"zh-tw": " At that point, I thought I knew something about global warming. I thought it was a 30 to 50 year problem.", "en": " 那時我以為我對地球暖化有點概念了 我以為那是30到50年後才會發生的事"}, {"zh-tw": " And after we saw his slide show, it became clear that it was much more urgent. And so right afterwards, I met backstage with Al, and with Lawrence Bender, who was there, and Laurie David, and Davis Guggenheim, who was running documentaries for Participant at the time.", "en": " 但在我看完他的演講之後 才發現這問題是相當急迫的 所以演講之後, 我在後臺跟高爾見面 還有勞倫斯班德也在那, 以及勞瑞大衛 還有戴維斯古根漢 他當時在參與者製作公司拍紀錄短片"}, {"zh-tw": " And with Al's blessing, we decided on the spot to turn it into a film, because we felt that we could get the message out there far more quickly than having Al go around the world, speaking to audiences of 100 or 200 at a time. And you know, there's another adage in Hollywood, that nobody knows nothing about anything.", "en": " 托高爾的福, 我們當場就立刻決定要把這議題拍成電影 因為我們覺得這樣可以更快的把這訊息傳播出去 比起讓高爾巡迴世界 一次只能對100至200位觀眾演講 還有大家都知道, 在好萊塢有另一句名言 就是人皆有所知"}, {"zh-tw": " And I really thought this was going to be a straight-to-PBS charitable initiative. And so it was a great shock to all of us when the film really captured the public interest, and today is mandatory viewing in schools in England and Scotland, and most of Scandinavia.", "en": " 而我覺得這將會是 公共電視網慈善組織的大好契機 這也讓我們很驚訝 當這部電影成功地引起大眾注意的時候 直到今日, 這部電影成為在英國與蘇格蘭的各大學校裡指定放映影片 以及北歐的大部分國家"}, {"zh-tw": " We've sent 50,000 DVDs to high school teachers in the U.S. and it's really changed the debate on global warming.", "en": " 我們寄了5萬張DVD給美國的高中教師 而這真的改變大眾對地球暖化的認知"}, {"zh-tw": " It was also a pretty good year for this guy. We now call Al the George Clooney of global warming.", "en": " 那年對這個男人來說也是非常好的一年 我們現在都稱呼高爾為地球暖化的喬治克魯尼"}, {"zh-tw": " And for Participant, this is just the start. Everything we do looks at the major issues in the world.", "en": " 但這對參與者公司來說, 這只是個開端 現在我們所作的一切都是全世界最主要的議題"}, {"zh-tw": " And we have 10 films in production right now, and dozens others in development. I'll quickly talk about a few coming up.", "en": " 我們現在有10部電影正在拍攝當中 有幾十部電影正在籌備 我很快的談一下接下來幾部要上映的電影"}, {"zh-tw": " One is \"Charlie Wilson's War,\" with Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts. And it's the true story of Congressman Charlie Wilson, and how he funded the Taliban to fight the Russians in Afghanistan.", "en": " 一部為『蓋世奇才』由湯姆漢克與茱莉亞蘿勃茲主演 是在講述國會議員查理威爾森的真實故事 描述他如何資助塔利班政府在阿富汗對抗蘇俄"}, {"zh-tw": " And we're also doing a movie called \"The Kite Runner,\" based on the book \"The Kite Runner,\" also about Afghanistan. And we think once people see these films, they'll have a much better understanding of that part of the world and the Middle East in general.", "en": " 還有一部電影叫作『追風箏的孩子』 是改編於同名小說, 同樣也是描述阿富汗的故事 我們認為人們可以透過觀看這些電影 能夠比較了解電影描述的那個世界 也就是整個中東地區"}, {"zh-tw": " We premiered a film called \"The Chicago 10\" at Sundance this year.

And in particular, we've been following him on his recent book tour, which, as many of you know, has been very non-controversial -- -- which is really bad for getting people to come see a movie.", "en": " 還有一部是關於吉米卡特的紀錄片 記錄他在這些年來對維護中東地區和平的貢獻 特別的是我們還一路跟隨著他的新書宣傳活動 他的新書, 大家都知道的, 是非常不具爭議性的 這也很難讓民眾會想去看這部電影"}, {"zh-tw": " In closing, I'd like to say that everybody has the opportunity to make change in their own way. And all the people in this room have done so through their business lives, or their philanthropic work, or their other interests.", "en": " 最後, 我想說的是每一個人都有機會 以自己的方式來改變這個世界 而這屋裡的每一個人 都一定有作出貢獻, 不管是透過工作 或慈善事務,或其他方式"}, {"zh-tw": " And one thing that I've learned is that there's never one right way to make change.
