How do we live it successfully? What is the appropriatenew metaphor for aging? I've spent the last year researchingand writing about this subject.

You're able to free yourself from your past.", "en": " 及自己。 你能夠走出 過去的陰霾。"}, {"zh-tw": " You can work to changeyour relationship to your past.

It turns out that cognitive research shows when we are able to do this, it manifests neurologically -- neural pathways are created in the brain.", "en": " 決定我們生活品質的 是我們如何看待事情、 我們賦予該事件什麼樣的意義、 我們對該事件抱持什麼樣的態度、 我們讓該事件誘發什麼樣的情緒。」 也許生命尾章的中心目的 是回到過去，如果適當的話， 並嘗試改變自己與過往 的關係。 認知研究發現 當我們這麼做的時候， 大腦中的神經活動會特別顯著 - 也就是說神經傳導路徑會在大腦生成。"}, {"zh-tw": " You see, if you have, over time, reacted negativelyto past events and people, neural pathways are laid down by chemical and electrical signalsthat are sent through the brain. And over time, these neural pathwaysbecome hardwired.", "en": " 所以如果你一直對過往的 人事物是抱持著負面的態度， 由大腦傳遞出的化學及電子訊息鋪設而成的 神經傳導路徑 長久下來就會變成固定的模式。 形成標準路徑--"}, {"zh-tw": " They become the norm --even if it's bad for us, because it causes us stress and anxiety.
