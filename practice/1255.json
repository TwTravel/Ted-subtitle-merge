And what was God's will? Well God's will was thatthe amount of suffering in any kind of war be reduced to as smallan amount as possible.", "en": " 他只是照著上帝的想法在做事而已. 什麼是上帝的意愿呢? 上帝的意愿是,在任何一場戰爭中 人家承受的痛苦應該越小越好."}, {"zh-tw": " And what did the Norden bombsight do? Well it allowed you to do that. It allowed you to bomb only those things that you absolutely neededand wanted to bomb.", "en": " Norden的設備是做什麼的呢? 它的作用就是 讓你只炸那些你必須要炸 和想炸的東西."}, {"zh-tw": " So in the years leading up tothe Second World War, the U.S. military buys 90,000 of these Norden bombsights at a cost of $14,000 each -- again, in 1940 dollars,that's a lot of money. And they trained 50,000 bombardierson how to use them -- long extensive, months-longtraining sessions -- because these things areessentially analog computers; they're not easy to use.", "en": " 所以在二戰來臨前的那些年, 美國軍隊買了九萬個 這樣的投彈瞄準儀 每一個價值一萬四千美元 在1940年,這是很大一筆錢呀. 他們訓練了五萬個投彈手來使用這個儀器 幾個月長的高強度的訓練-- 因為這東西實際上類似於計算機; 不很容易用."}, {"zh-tw": " And they make every oneof those bombardiers take an oath, to swear that if they're ever captured, they will not divulge a single detail of this particular device to the enemy, because it's imperativethe enemy not get their hands on this absolutely essentialpiece of technology. And whenever the Norden bombsightis taken onto a plane, it's escorted there bya series of armed guards.", "en": " 而且他們讓每一個使用這儀器的投彈手發誓, 讓他們發誓如果他們被敵人抓了, 他們不能洩露一點關於 這個設備的細節, 因為不讓敵方知道哪怕一丁點關於這個特別 重要的儀器的信息是相當必要的. 每次當把Norden的投彈瞄準儀放到一個飛機上去時, 都有一隊荷槍實彈的保衛護送."}, {"zh-tw": " And it's carried in a boxwith a canvas shroud over it. And the box is handcuffedto one of the guards.", "en": " 它被放在一個盒子裡，盒子上蓋的是帆布的壽衣． 而且這個盒子是和一個士兵﨧在一起的．"}, {"zh-tw": " It's never allowed to be photographed.

So what happens duringthe Second World War? Well, it turns outit's not the Holy Grail.", "en": " Norden的投彈瞄準儀 被當作了聖杯 所以二戰時發生了什麼呢？ 事實證明，它並不是聖杯．"}, {"zh-tw": " In practice, the Norden bombsight can drop a bomb intoa pickle barrel at 20,000 ft., but that's under perfect conditions. And of course, in wartime, conditions aren't perfect.", "en": " 在實戰中，Norden的投彈瞄準儀 是可以把炸彈從兩萬英尺高的高空仍到一個咸菜桶裡. 但那是在完美條件下． 當然，在戰爭中 條件總是不完美的．"}, {"zh-tw": " First of all, it's really hard to use --really hard to use. And not all of the people who are of those 50,000 menwho are bombardiers have the ability to properlyprogram an analog computer.", "en": " 首先，它真的很難操作． 不是所有那五萬名投彈手 都有能力控制一個 類似於計算機的程序．"}, {"zh-tw": " Secondly, it breaks down a lot. It's full of all kindsof gyroscopes and pulleys and gadgets and ball-bearings, and they don't work as wellas they ought to in the heat of battle.", "en": " 其次，它經常會壞． 它裡面裝滿了各種陀螺儀，滑輪， 小工具以及球軸承 在戰場的熱浪中，這些東西不像 它們本來那樣工作．"}, {"zh-tw": " Thirdly, when Nordenwas making his calculations, he assumed that a plane would be flying at a relatively slow speedat low altitudes. Well in a real war, you can't do that; you'll get shot down.", "en": " 第三點，當Norden做計算的時候， 他假設飛機是以較慢的速度 在較低的高空飛行． 但在實際戰爭中，不是這樣的． 飛機這樣飛行會被擊中的．"}, {"zh-tw": " So they started flying themat high altitudes at incredibly high speeds. And the Norden bombsightdoesn't work as well under those conditions.", "en": " 飛機實際上是以很快的速度在很高的高空飛行． Norden的投彈瞄準儀在這樣的條件下 表現並不好．"}, {"zh-tw": " But most of all, the Norden bombsightrequired the bombardier to make visual contact with the target. But of course, what happens in real life? There are clouds, right.", "en": " 最重要的一點是， Norden的投彈瞄準儀需要投彈手 能用眼睛看到目標物． 但什麼是實際情況呢？ 天上會有雲，"}, {"zh-tw": " It needs cloudless skyto be really accurate. Well how many cloudless skies do you think therewere above Central Europe between 1940 and 1945? Not a lot.", "en": " 它需要沒有雲朵的天空來進行準確的瞄準． 你猜在1940年到1945年這幾年中 在中歐的天空上， 到底有多少天是沒有雲朵的呢？ 並不非常多．"}, {"zh-tw": " And then to give you a sense of just how inaccuratethe Norden bombsight was, there was a famous case in 1944 where the Allies bombeda chemical plant in Leuna, Germany. And the chemical plant comprised 757 acres.", "en": " 大概給你一個印象， 知道Norden的投彈瞄準儀到底有多不準確． 在1944年有一個有名的例子， 盟軍在德國洛伊納炸了一個化學工廠 這個工廠有757公頃 那麼大．"}, {"zh-tw": " And over the courseof 22 bombing missions, the Allies dropped 85,000 bombs on this 757 acre chemical plant, using the Norden bombsight. Well what percentage of those bombs do you think actually landed inside the 700-acreperimeter of the plant? 10 percent. 10 percent.", "en": " 在22輪轟炸過程中 盟軍用Norden的投彈瞄準儀 在這片757公頃的化學工廠上方 投下了八萬五千個炸彈． 你認為大概有多少 炸彈實際上落在了 這七百多公頃的工廠上？ 只有百分之十．"}, {"zh-tw": " And of those 10 percent that landed, 16 percent didn't even go off;they were duds. The Leuna chemical plant, after one of the most extensivebombings in the history of the war, was up and running within weeks.", "en": " 而且在這百分之十的炸彈中， 有百分之十六的炸彈都沒有炸開,是啞彈． 這家化學工廠 在經歷了戰爭史上最強勁的轟炸後， 幾個星期內就又重新開始工作了．"}, {"zh-tw": " And by the way, all those precautions to keep the Norden bombsightout of the hands of the Nazis? Well it turns out that Carl Norden, as a proper Swiss, was very enamored of German engineers. So in the 1930s,he hired a whole bunch of them, including a man named Hermann Long who, in 1938, gave a complete set of the plansfor the Norden bombsight to the Nazis.", "en": " 另外，所有那些為了不讓納粹 知道有關Norden投彈瞄準儀的措施呢？ 結果是 Carl Norden對德國的工程師們特別偏愛． 就像別的瑞士人一樣． 所以在三十年代，他雇佣了一些德國工程師． 其中一個叫Hermann Long. 他在1938年把關於Norden投彈瞄準儀計劃的 一整套信息給了納粹．"}, {"zh-tw": " So they had their own Norden bombsightthroughout the entire war -- which also, by the way,didn't work very well. So why do we talk aboutthe Norden bombsight? Well because we live in an age where there are lots and lots of Norden bombsights.", "en": " 所以在戰爭期間，納粹有他們自己的Norden投彈瞄準儀， 雖然這些也不怎麼好用． 如果這樣，那我們為什麼要談Norden投彈瞄準儀呢？ 那是因為我們生活在 一個充滿Norden投彈瞄準儀 的時代．"}, {"zh-tw": " We live in a timewhere there are all kinds of really, really smart people running around, sayingthat they've invented gadgets that will forever change our world. They've invented websitesthat will allow people to be free.", "en": " 我們生活在一個到處都是非常非常聰明 的人的時代， 他們到處奔走，說他們發明了 能從此改變世界的新奇東西． 他們發明了能讓人們自由的網站．"}, {"zh-tw": " They've invented some kind of this thing,or this thing, or this thing that will make our world forever better. If you go into the military, you'll find lots of Carl Nordens as well.", "en": " 他們發明了這樣那樣的東西 能讓我們的世界從此變得更美好． 如果你去軍隊中， 你會發現有好多好多Carl Norden."}, {"zh-tw": " If you go to the Pentagon, they will say, \"You know what, now we really can put a bomb inside a pickle barrel at 20,000 ft.\" And you know what, it's true;they actually can do that now. But we need to be very clear about how little that means.", "en": " 如果你去五角大樓，他們會說 ＂你知道嗎？我們現在 真的能把炸彈從兩萬英尺高的高空 投到一個咸菜桶裡. 而且，他們說的確實是事實． 但我們得非常清楚 這樣做是多麼的難．"}, {"zh-tw": " In the Iraq War, at the beginningof the first Iraq War, the U.S. military, the air force, sent two squadronsof F-15E Fighter Eagles to the Iraqi desert equipped with thesefive million dollar cameras that allowed them to seethe entire desert floor. And their mission wasto find and to destroy -- remember the Scud missile launchers, those surface-to-air missiles that the Iraqis were launchingat the Israelis? The mission of the two squadrons was to get rid of all theScud missile launchers.", "en": " 在伊拉克戰爭中，在最開始的階段， 美國的軍隊，空軍 派出了兩支F-15E鷹式戰鬥機的部隊 到伊拉克的沙漠裡 帶著這些五百萬美金的照相機 從而能看到整個沙漠表面． 他們的任務是尋找，并且摧毀 還記得飛毛腿導彈發射器嗎？ 那些伊拉克人用來襲擊以色列人的 地對空導彈． 這兩支部隊的任務 就是去摧毀這些飛毛腿導彈發射器．"}, {"zh-tw": " And so they flew missions day and night, and they dropped thousands of bombs, and they fired thousands of missiles in an attempt to get ridof this particular scourge. And after the war was over,there was an audit done -- as the army always does,the air force always does -- and they asked the question: how many Scuds did we actually destroy? You know what the answer was? Zero, not a single one.", "en": " 所以他們白天黑夜地執行任務， 投下了幾千枚炸彈， 他們執行了幾千次任務 試圖想除掉這些發射器． 戰爭結束後，曾有過一個審核 這是軍隊中，空軍中的慣例-- 他們問 我們到底除掉了多少發射器？ 猜猜結果如何？ 零，一個都沒有．"}, {"zh-tw": " Now why is that? Is it because their weaponsweren't accurate? Oh no, they were brilliantly accurate. They could have destroyedthis little thing right here from 25,000 ft.", "en": " 為什麼呢？ 他們的設備不夠準確嗎？ 不是，那些設備相當的精確． 他們可以從二萬五千英尺的高空 輕鬆除掉那小東西．"}, {"zh-tw": " The issue was they didn't knowwhere the Scud launchers were. The problem with bombs and pickle barrels is not getting the bombinside the pickle barrel, it's knowing how tofind the pickle barrel.", "en": " 問題是他們不知道這些飛毛腿導彈發射器在哪裡． 關於炸彈和咸菜桶， 問題不在於如何把炸彈投到咸菜桶裡， 而是如果找到咸菜桶．"}, {"zh-tw": " That's always been the harder problem when it comes to fighting wars. Or take the battle in Afghanistan.", "en": " 這總是戰爭中 很難的問題． 再來看看阿富汗戰爭．"}, {"zh-tw": " What is the signature weapon of the CIA's war in Northwest Pakistan? It's the drone. What is the drone?

It is this weapon of devastatingaccuracy and precision.", "en": " 中央情報局用在西北巴基斯坦的 標誌性的武器是什麼？ 無人駕駛飛機．什麼是無人駕駛飛機？ 其實它就是Norden投彈瞄準儀的孫子輩的產物． 它有極高的精確性和準確度．"}, {"zh-tw": " And over the course of the last six years in Northwest Pakistan, the CIA has flown hundredsof drone missiles, and it's used those drones to kill 2,000 suspected Pakistani and Taliban militants. Now what is the accuracy of those drones? Well it's extraordinary.", "en": " 在過去六年裡 在巴基斯坦的西北部， 中央情報局用了幾百次這個設備， 殺掉了二千多名 巴基斯坦和塔利班的 武裝人員． 那這些無人駕駛的飛機準確度有多高呢？ 那是相當驚人的．"}, {"zh-tw": " We think we're now at 95 percent accuracy when it comes to drone strikes. 95 percent of the peoplewe kill need to be killed, right? That is one of the mostextraordinary records in the history of modern warfare.", "en": " 我們現在認為大約有百分之九十五的準確度 當我們用無人駕駛的飛機時 有百分之九十五的想要擊中的人被擊中了，對吧？ 這是現在戰爭史上 最好的記錄了．"}, {"zh-tw": " But do you know what the crucial thing is? In that exact same period that we've been using these drones with devastating accuracy, the number of attacks, of suicide attacksand terrorist attacks, against American forces in Afghanistan has increased tenfold.
