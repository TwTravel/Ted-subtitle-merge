You have six months or a year to live.\" And you start thinking aboutwhat you would do with this time.", "en": " 我一直想有一天我也可能會坐在醫師前面， 他看著我的檢查報告，然後說： 「李卡多，情況不太妙。 你只能再活六個月到一年。」 然後你開始思索要怎麼度過這段時間。"}, {"zh-tw": " And you say, \"I'm going to spend more time with the kids. I'm going to visit these places, I'm going to go up and downmountains and places and I'm going to do all the thingsI didn't do when I had the time.\" But of course, we all know these are very bittersweet memories we're going to have.", "en": " 你說：「我要花更多時間陪小孩。 我要遊覽這些那些地方， 我要上山下海， 我要去做我有時間卻沒做的事。」 但是我們想也知道， 這些都將是苦樂參半的回憶。"}, {"zh-tw": " It's very difficult to do. You spend a good part of the timecrying, probably.", "en": " 這是很煎熬的事。 你大概還會花好大一段時間哭泣。"}, {"zh-tw": " So I said, I'm going to do something else. Every Monday and Thursday,I'm going use my terminal days.", "en": " 所以我說，我要做點不一樣的事。 每個星期一及星期四，我要充分利用我的臨終日。"}, {"zh-tw": " And I will do, during those days, whatever it is I was going to doif I had received that piece of news. When you think about -- when you think about the opposite of work, we, many times, think it's leisure.", "en": " 我要在這些日子 做所有我想做的事，好像我真的接到這樣的噩耗一般。 當你想到── 當你想到工作的相反詞， 我們常常認為是休閒。"}, {"zh-tw": " And you say, ah, I need some leisure time, and so forth. But the fact is that,leisure is a very busy thing.", "en": " 你說，啊！我需要一些休閒的時間，諸如此類。 但其實休閒是很忙的一件事。"}, {"zh-tw": " You go play golf and tennis,and you meet people, and you're going for lunch,and you're late for the movies. It's a very crowded thing that we do.", "en": " 你打高爾夫、網球，你要見朋友， 你跟別人約吃午餐，看電影要遲到了。 我們把時間塞得滿滿的。"}, {"zh-tw": " The opposite of work is idleness. But very few of us knowwhat to do with idleness.", "en": " 工作的相對是什麼事都不做。 但是很少有人知道要怎麼度過什麼都不做的時光。"}, {"zh-tw": " When you look at the waythat we distribute our lives in general, you realize that in the periodsin which we have a lot of money, we have very little time. And then when we finally have time,we have neither the money nor the health.", "en": " 當你看我們分配生活的方式， 你就會明白我們很有錢的時候， 我們的時間卻很少。 當我們終於有時間了，卻沒有錢或健康。"}, {"zh-tw": " So we started thinking about thatas a company for the last 30 years. This is a complicated companywith thousands of employees, hundreds of millionsof dollars of business that makes rocket fuel propellent systems,runs 4,000 ATMs in Brazil, does income tax preparationfor dozens of thousands.", "en": " 所以過去 30 年我們以公司的角度在思考這件事。 這是個很複雜的公司，有數千名員工， 億萬美元的業務， 製造火箭推進劑系統，在巴西營運四千台自動櫃員機， 幫成千上萬人報稅。"}, {"zh-tw": " So this is not a simple business. We looked at it and we said, let's devolve to these people,let's give these people a company where we take awayall the boarding school aspects of, this is when you arrive,this is how you dress, this is how you go to meetings,this is what you say, this is what you don't say, and let's see what's left.", "en": " 所以這不是個簡單的公司。 我們看看它然後說， 讓我們把重心轉向這些人，讓我們給這些人一間公司， 把所有寄宿學校的規矩都拿掉， 像是你該幾點到、你該怎麼穿、 你該怎麼開會、你該說什麼、 你不該說什麼， 然後來看會是怎樣的情況。"}, {"zh-tw": " So we started this about 30 years ago, and we started dealingwith this very issue. And so we said, look, the retirement, the whole issue of how we distribute our graph of life.", "en": " 我們大約在 30 年前開始做這件事， 我們開始面對這項問題。 所以我們說，你看，退休， 我們要如何分配生活這項議題。"}, {"zh-tw": " Instead of going mountain climbingwhen you're 82, why don't you do it next week?

So we started saying things like, why do we want to knowwhat time you came to work, what time you left, etc.? Can't we exchange this for a contract for buying something from you,some kind of work? Why are we building these headquarters? Is it not an ego issuethat we want to look solid and big and important? But we're dragging you two hoursacross town because of it? So we started asking questions one by one.", "en": " 所以我們又開始看， 然後我們說，我們得用不同的方法做事。 所以我們開始說像是 為什麼我們想知道你幾點來上班， 幾點下班等等的問題？ 難道我們不能以此交換一項契約， 從你身上買些東西，某些工作？ 為什麼我們要蓋這些總部大樓？ 難道這不是一種自我意識，我們想要看起來很穩固牢靠， 又大又重要？ 但是我們要你在路上塞兩個小時就為了這個？ 所以我們開始問問題，一個接著一個問。"}, {"zh-tw": " We'd say it like this: One: How do we find people? We'd go out and tryand recruit people and we'd say, look, when you come to us, we're not going to havetwo or three interviews and then you're going to bemarried to us for life. That's not how we do the rest of our lives.", "en": " 我們問像這樣的問題： 一、我們怎麼找人？ 我們就去外面試了一下，招人的時候我們說， 聽好，如果你到我們這邊來， 我們不會安排二三回面試， 然後要你一輩子嫁給我們。 那不是我們度過餘生的方式。"}, {"zh-tw": " So, come have your interviews. Anyone who's interestedin interviewing, you will show up.", "en": " 所以，就來面試吧。 任何有興趣面試的人都可以來。"}, {"zh-tw": " And then we'll see what happensout of the intuition that rises from that, instead of just filling out the little items of whether you're the right person. And then, come back.", "en": " 然後我們要看這種憑直覺的面試會有什麼結果， 而不是填寫你是否為正確人選的那些小項目。 然後，再回來看看。"}, {"zh-tw": " Spend an afternoon, spend a whole day,talk to anybody you want. Make sure we are the bride you thought we were and not all the bullshitwe put into our own ads.", "en": " 來這裡過一個下午、過一天，去跟你想談的人對話。 確定我們的確是你心目中合適的新娘， 而不是徵婚廣告上誇張不實的鬼扯。"}, {"zh-tw": " Slowly we went to a process where we'd say things like, we don't want anyone to bea leader in the company if they haven't been interviewed and approved by their future subordinates. Every six months, everyone gets evaluated, anonymously, as a leader.", "en": " 慢慢地我們找到一種方式，我們會這樣說， 我們不要任何人在這間公司裡當領導人， 如果他們還沒被他們未來的下屬 面試及認可，就不可以當。 每六個月，每位領導人都要接受無記名評估。"}, {"zh-tw": " And this determines whether they shouldcontinue in that leadership position, which is many timessituational, as you know. And so if they don't have 70, 80 percent of a grade, they don't stay, which is probably the reason whyI haven't been CEO for more than 10 years.", "en": " 這決定他們是否能繼續他們領導階層的位置， 這個位置常常很情境式，你知道的。 所以如果他們不能拿個七八十分，他們就不能待下去。 這大概就是為什麼我已經超過十年沒當執行長的原因。"}, {"zh-tw": " And over time, we started askingother questions. We said things like, why can't people set their own salaries? What do they need to know? There's only three things you need to know: how much people make inside the company, how much people make somewhereelse in a similar business and how much we make in generalto see whether we can afford it.", "en": " 隨著時間推移，我們開始問其他問題。 我們問問題像是， 為什麼大家不能自訂薪水？ 他們需要知道什麼？ 你只需要知道三件事： 公司內的人薪資多少？ 在業界薪資行情又是多少？ 公司通常要賺多少才付的起？"}, {"zh-tw": " So let's give people these threepieces of information. So we started having, in the cafeteria, a computer where you could go in and you could ask what someone spent, how much someone makes, what they make in benefits, what the company makes, what the margins are, and so forth.", "en": " 所以我們給大家這三項資料。 後來我們開始在員工餐廳 放一台電腦，你可以進去問 某人花多少、某人賺多少、 他們有什麼福利、公司又賺多少、 利潤是多少等等。"}, {"zh-tw": " And this is 25 years ago. As this information started coming to people, we said things like, we don't want to see your expense report, we don't want to know how many holidays you're taking, we don't want to know where you work.", "en": " 這還是 25 年前。 當這樣的情報開始流傳出去， 我們會說，我們不想知道你的開支表， 我們不想知道你要放多少天假， 我們不想知道你在哪裡辦公。"}, {"zh-tw": " We had, at one point,14 different offices around town, and we'd say, go to the one that's closest to your house, to the customer that you're going to visit today. Don't tell us where you are.", "en": " 我們曾經一度在城裡14 個不同的地方設辦公室， 我們說，去離你家最近的那個上班， 去你今天要去拜訪的客戶那邊。 不要告訴我們你在那。"}, {"zh-tw": " And more, even when we hadthousands of people, 5,000 people, we had two people in the H.R. department, and thankfully one of them has retired. And so, the question we were asking was,how can we be taking care of people? People are the only thing we have.", "en": " 更扯的是，即使在我們有數千員工，五千名員工的時代， 我們只有兩個人在人資部門， 而且謝天謝地其中一個已經退休了。 所以，我們那時問的問題是，我們要怎麼照顧員工？ 員工是我們唯一擁有的。"}, {"zh-tw": " We can't have a department that runsafter people and looks after people. So as we started finding that this worked,and we'd say, we're looking for -- and this is, I think,the main thing I was looking for in the terminal days and in the company, which is, how do you set up for wisdom? We've come from an age of revolution,industrial revolution, an age of information,an age of knowledge, but we're not any closerto the age of wisdom.", "en": " 我們不可能搞一個部門天天追著員工跑、盯著員工看。 所以當我們開始發現這方法有用，我們就說我們要找── 我想這也是我在臨終日 及在這間公司所尋找的主要東西── 就是，你要如何建立智慧？ 我們是革命時代的產物，工業革命、 資訊時代、知識時代， 卻離智慧時代還很遠。"}, {"zh-tw": " How we design, how do we organize,for more wisdom? So for example, many times, what's the smartest or the intelligentdecision doesn't jive. So we'd say things like, let's agree that you're going to sell57 widgets per week.", "en": " 我們如何設計，如何組織以得到更多智慧？ 舉個例子，有好多次， 什麼是最聰明最明智，又不會被笑的決定？ 所以我們會說像這樣的事， 就說你同意一星期要賣57 個界面小工具好了。"}, {"zh-tw": " If you sell them by Wednesday, please go to the beach. Don't create a problem for us, for manufacturing, for application, then we have to buy new companies,we have to buy our competitors, we have to do all kinds of thingsbecause you sold too many widgets.", "en": " 如果你在星期三前賣完，請去海邊玩。 不要給我們、給製造商、給小程式製造問題， 不然我們就得買新的公司，我們就得買下對手， 我們要做一大堆事，因為你賣了太多界面小工具。"}, {"zh-tw": " So go to the beachand start again on Monday. So the process is looking for wisdom.", "en": " 所以就去海邊玩吧，星期一再重新開始。 所以這整個過程是想尋求智慧。"}, {"zh-tw": " And in the process, of course, we wanted people to know everything, and we wanted to be truly democraticabout the way we ran things. So our board had two seats open with the same voting rights, for the first two people who showed up.", "en": " 當然在過程中，我們要大家知道每件事， 我們想在我們經營方法上有真正的民主。 所以我們的董事會有兩個空的席次，跟其他董事有同等的投票權， 要給最先來公司上班的兩個人。"}, {"zh-tw": " And so we had cleaning ladies votingon a board meeting, which had a lot of other very importantpeople in suits and ties. And the fact is that they kept us honest.", "en": " 所以我們有公司清潔婦在董事會裡， 在這個其他重要人物都西裝筆挺的會議裡投票。 事實是他們讓我們誠實。"}, {"zh-tw": " This process, as we started lookingat the people who came to us, we'd say, now wait a second, people come to us and they say,where am I supposed to sit? How am I supposed to work?Where am I going to be in 5 years' time? And we looked at that and we said,we have to start much earlier. Where do we start? We said, oh, kindergarten seems like a good place.", "en": " 這個過程，就在我們開始看著大家爭相進入我們公司， 我們說，等一下， 他們進了公司，他們問，我應該坐哪裡？ 我要怎麼開始？五年後我在哪裡？ 我們看著這情況我們說，我們得早點開始。 我們從哪裡開始？ 我們說，喔，從幼兒園開始好像不錯。"}, {"zh-tw": " So we set up a foundation, which now has, for 11 years, three schools, where we started askingthe same questions, how do you redesign school for wisdom? It is one thing to say,we need to recycle the teachers, we need the directors to do more. But the fact is that what we dowith education is entirely obsolete.", "en": " 所以我們設立了一個基金會，11 年來已經有三所學校， 我們在這些學校問同樣的問題， 我們要怎麼為智慧重新設計學校？ 一方面我們需要再利用老師， 我們需要主管做更多事。 但事實是我們辦教育的方式早已完全過時。"}, {"zh-tw": " The teacher's role is entirely obsolete. Going from a math class, to biology,to 14th-century France is very silly.", "en": " 老師的角色完全過時。 從數學課教到生物課，教到 14 世紀法國史真的很笨。"}, {"zh-tw": " So we started thinking, what could it look like? And we put together people, including people who like education, people like Paulo Freire, and two ministers of education in Brazil and we said, if we were to designa school from scratch, what would it look like? And so we created this school,which is called Lumiar, and Lumiar, one of themis a public school, and Lumiar says the following: Let's divide this roleof the teacher into two. One guy, we'll call a tutor.", "en": " 所以我們開始思考，那到底應該是什麼樣子？ 我們把大家聚在一起，包括喜歡教育的人， 像保羅．弗雷勒，及巴西兩位教育部長， 我們說，如果我們要重頭設計學校， 會是甚麼樣子？ 所以我們設計了這所學校，稱為慧光， 慧光有一間是公立學校。 慧光的宗旨是： 讓我們把老師的角色一分為二。 一個我們稱之為導師。"}, {"zh-tw": " A tutor, in the old sense of the Greek\"paideia\": Look after the kid. What's happening at home,what's their moment in life, etc..", "en": " 導師在古希臘字義為：照顧孩子。 問問孩子家裡發生什麼事、照顧他們生命中重要的時刻…等等。"}, {"zh-tw": " But please don't teach, because the little you know compared to Google, we don't want to know. Keep that to yourself.", "en": " 但是請不要教書， 因為你的實力有多接近 Google 搜尋，我們不想知道。 你自己藏拙就好。"}, {"zh-tw": " Now, we'll bring in peoplewho have two things: passion and expertise, and it could betheir profession or not. And we use the senior citizens, who are 25 percent of the populationwith wisdom that nobody wants anymore.", "en": " 我們要請有兩種特質的人： 熱情及專長，是不是本科都行。 我們也請耆老， 耆老佔了人口數的 25%，擁有沒人要的智慧。"}, {"zh-tw": " So we bring them to school and we say, teach these kids whateveryou really believe in. So we have violinists teaching math.", "en": " 所以我們請他們到學校，我們說， 教這些孩子你由衷相信的東西。 所以我們有小提琴家教數學。"}, {"zh-tw": " We have all kinds of things where we say, don't worry about the course material anymore. We have approximately 10 great threadsthat go from 2 to 17.", "en": " 我們有各式各樣的東西，我們說 不要再擔心教材。 我們有大約十種很棒的主題給 2 歲到 17 歲的孩子上。"}, {"zh-tw": " Things like, how do we measureourselves as humans? So there's a place for math and physicsand all that there. How do we express ourselves? So there's a placefor music and literature, etc., but also for grammar.", "en": " 像是，身為人類，我們怎麼測量自己？ 所以這結合了數學與物理還有其他東西。 我們怎麼表達自己？ 所以這結合了音樂與文學…等等， 同時還有文法。"}, {"zh-tw": " And then we have thingsthat everyone has forgotten, which are probably the most important things in life. The very important things in life,we know nothing about.", "en": " 我們還教每個人都已經忘記， 卻可能是人生最重要的東西。 人生中非常重要的東西，我們卻一無所知。"}, {"zh-tw": " We know nothing about love, we know nothing about death, we know nothing about why we're here. So we need a thread in school thattalks about everything we don't know.", "en": " 我們對愛一無所知、 我們對死一無所知、 我們對我們為什麼存在一無所知。 所以我們在學校要教所有我們不知道的事情這個主題。"}, {"zh-tw": " So that's a big part of what we do. So over the years, we started goinginto other things.", "en": " 這佔了我們的教學很大一部分。 這幾年，我們開始探索其他東西。"}, {"zh-tw": " We'd say, why do we have to scold the kids and say, sit down and come here and do that, and so forth. We said, let's get the kids to do something we call a circle, which meets once a week.", "en": " 我們說，為什麼我們要責罵孩子， 要說，坐下、到這裡來、做這個做那個，等等。 我們說，讓孩子來做我們稱為「循環」的課， 一週上一次。"}, {"zh-tw": " And we'd say, you put the rules together and then you decidewhat you want to do with it. So can you all hit yourself on the head? Sure, for a week, try.", "en": " 我們說，你們把規則通通看一下， 然後決定你要怎麼做。 所以你們都想撞頭嗎？ 好啊！做一個星期，試試看。"}, {"zh-tw": " They came up with the very samerules that we had, except they're theirs. And then, they have the power, which means, they can and dosuspend and expel kids so that we're not playing school,they really decide.", "en": " 結果他們得出跟我們一模一樣的規則， 只是現在這些規則是他們定的了。 這樣，他們就有權限， 也就是說，他們的確可以讓孩子停學並趕出學校， 我們不是在玩扮學校的遊戲，他們真的能做決定。"}, {"zh-tw": " And then, in this same vein, we keep a digital mosaic, because this is not constructivistor Montessori or something. It's something where we keepthe Brazilian curriculum with 600 tiles of a mosaic, which we want to expose these kidsto by the time they're 17.", "en": " 然後，本著同樣的精神， 我們還有所謂數位鑲嵌， 因為這不是建構式教學，也不是蒙特梭利或什麼， 這是我們把巴西的課程， 六百種不同的課程鑲嵌在一起， 讓孩子在 17 歲前能接觸到。"}, {"zh-tw": " And follow this all the timeand we know how they're doing and we say, you're not interested in this now, let's wait a year. And the kids are in groupsthat don't have an age category, so the six-year-old kidwho is ready for that with an 11-year-old, that eliminates all of the gangsand the groups and this stuff that we have in the schools, in general.", "en": " 一路都這麼做，我們就會知道他們的表現， 我們會說，你現在對這個沒興趣，再等一年。 這些孩子分成幾組，不是按年齡分， 所以程度夠的六歲孩子可以與十一歲的孩子一起上課。 這樣可以排除成群結黨的小團體， 這些現象在學校還蠻常見。"}, {"zh-tw": " And they have a zero to 100 percent grading, which they do themselves with an appevery couple of hours. Until we know they're 37 percent of theway we'd like them to be on this issue, so that we can send them out in the worldwith them knowing enough about it.", "en": " 而且他們還有0 到 100 分的評分法， 他們每隔幾個小時就用小程式自己評分。 我們要他們繼續上同樣的課程，直到他們拿到 37 分為止。 所以出社會時他們起碼在這些議題上知道點什麼。"}, {"zh-tw": " And so the courses are World Cup Soccer,or building a bicycle. And people will sign up for a 45-day course on building a bicycle.", "en": " 所以這些課程包括世界盃足球，或造腳踏車。 大家都來登記上一期 45 天的造腳踏車課。"}, {"zh-tw": " Now, try to build a bicycle without knowing that pi is 3.1416. You can't.", "en": " 那，試試看在不知道圓周率為3.1416 的情況下造一輛腳踏車。 不可能。"}, {"zh-tw": " And try, any one of you, using 3.1416 for something. You don't know anymore.", "en": " 你們任何人試試用 3.1416 做點什麼。 你不知道能做什麼了吧。"}, {"zh-tw": " So this is lost and that's what we try to do there, which is looking for wisdom in that school. And that brings us back to this graphand this distribution of our life.", "en": " 所以這是損失，這也就是為什麼我們試著做這個， 就是在那所學校裡尋找智慧。 而那也讓我們回過頭來看看這張生命的分配圖。"}, {"zh-tw": " I accumulated a lot of money when I think about it. When you think and you say,now is the time to give back -- well, if you're giving back, you took too much.", "en": " 當我想到的時候我已經賺了很多錢。 你想一想然後你說，現在是回饋的時候了， 如果你現在要回饋，那是你之前拿太多了。"}, {"zh-tw": " I keep thinking of Warren Buffetwaking up one day and finding out he has 30 billion dollarsmore than he thought he had. And he looks and he says,what am I going to do with this? And he says, I'll give it to someonewho really needs this.", "en": " 我一直想到華倫·巴菲特有一天醒來 發現他的錢比他想的還多三百億美金。 他看看然後說，我要拿這些錢做什麼？ 然後他說，我要送給真正需要的人。"}, {"zh-tw": " I'll give it to Bill Gates. And my guy, who's my financialadvisor in New York, he says, look, you're a silly guy because you would have 4.1 times more money today if you had made money with moneyinstead of sharing as you go.", "en": " 我要給比爾·蓋茲。 我在紐約的理財專員 他說，聽好，你是個笨蛋， 因為你今天大可擁有比現在還多 4.1 倍的錢， 如果一路走來你願意錢滾錢，而不是分給別人。"}, {"zh-tw": " But I like sharing as you go better. I taught MBAs at MIT for a time and I ended up, one day,at the Mount Auburn Cemetery.", "en": " 但是我喜歡分給別人，因為這樣走的更好。 我曾在麻省理工教過工商管理一段時間， 有一天，我發現我在奧本山墓園。"}, {"zh-tw": " It is a beautiful cemetery in Cambridge. And I was walking around.It was my birthday and I was thinking.", "en": " 那是座美麗的墓園，在劍橋。 我在那裡四處走走，那天是我的生日，我在想事情。"}, {"zh-tw": " And the first time around, I saw these tombstones and these wonderful people who'd done great things and I thought, what do I want to be remembered for? And I did another stroll around, and the second time,another question came to me, which did me better, which was, why do I want to be remembered at all? And that, I think, took me different places. When I was 50, my wife Fernanda and Isat for a whole afternoon, we had a big pit with fire, and I threw everything I had ever done into that fire.", "en": " 我第一次繞的時候看到這些墓碑， 這些很棒的人，做了很多好事， 我就想，我要人家懷念我什麼？ 我又走了一圈； 第二次，另一個問題跑出來， 這次問的比較好了，就是 到底為什麼我想被人懷念？ 我想就是那個想法，帶我到了不同的境界。 我 50 歲時，我的太太費南妲和我坐了一整個下午， 我們搭了個大營火， 我把過去所有的成就都丟進火堆裡。"}, {"zh-tw": " This is a book in 38 languages, hundreds and hundreds of articlesand DVDs, everything there was. And that did two things.", "en": " 翻成 38 種語言的書， 成千上萬的文章和 DVD，每樣東西都丟進去。 這個舉動有兩個意義。"}, {"zh-tw": " One, it freed our five kidsfrom following in our steps, our shadow -- They don't know what I do. Which is good.", "en": " 一、這解放了我的五個孩子，不用追隨我們的腳步， 活在我們的陰影下，他們不知道我做過什麼。 這很好。"}, {"zh-tw": " And I'm not going to take them somewhere and say, one day all of this will be yours. The five kids know nothing, which is good.", "en": " 我不想帶他們到某處， 然後說，有一天，這一切都是你們的。 這五個孩子什麼都不知道，這很好。"}, {"zh-tw": " And the second thing is, I freed myself from this anchorof past achievement or whatever. I'm free to start something new every timeand to decide things from scratch in part of those terminal days.", "en": " 第二個意義是， 我自己也從過去的成就或管它是什麼解放。 我每次都可以隨心所欲重新開始， 在臨終日隨心所欲決定從頭開始。"}, {"zh-tw": " And some people would say, oh, so now you have this time,these terminal days, and so you go out and do everything. No, we've been to the beaches, so we've been to Samoa and Maldivesand Mozambique, so that's done.", "en": " 有些人可能會說， 喔，所以現在你有這段時間，這些臨終日， 所以你能去做每一件事。 不，我們已經去過海邊， 所以我們已經去過薩摩亞、馬爾地夫、莫三比克。 這件事已經完成。"}, {"zh-tw": " I've climbed mountains in the Himalayas. I've gone down 60 meters to see hammerhead sharks.", "en": " 我已經爬過喜馬拉雅山脈。 我已經潛水 60 公尺看過雙髻鯊。"}, {"zh-tw": " I've spent 59 days on the back of a camelfrom Chad to Timbuktu. I've gone to the magnetic North Pole on a dog sled.", "en": " 我也在駱駝背上度過 59 天，從查德走到廷巴克圖。 我也坐過狗拉雪橇到磁北極。"}, {"zh-tw": " So, we've been busy. It's what I'd like to call my empty bucket list.", "en": " 所以，我們很忙。 我想叫這個為「掛點前無事可做」。"}, {"zh-tw": " And with this rationale,I look at these days and I think, I'm not retired. I don't feel retired at all. And so I'm writing a new book.", "en": " 帶著這個意念，我看著我的臨終日然後想， 我還沒退休，我也不想退休。 所以我要寫本新書。"}, {"zh-tw": " We started three new companiesin the last two years.
