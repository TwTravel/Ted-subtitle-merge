I'm going to try to take you on a journey of the underwater acoustic world of whales and dolphins. Since we are such a visual species, it's hard for us to really understand this, so I'll use a mixture of figures and sounds and hope this can communicate it.", "en": " 非常感謝。我要帶大家進入一段 鯨魚和海豚的 水下聲音世界 由於我們多依賴視覺， 所以，要真正理解這些有點難度 因此我會結合圖表與聲音 來說明 希望這樣能把我想要表達的傳達給大家"}, {"zh-tw": " But let's also think, as a visual species, what it's like when we go snorkeling or diving and try to look underwater. We really can't see very far.", "en": " 但讓我們也思考一下，作為擁有視覺的物種， 當我們浮潛或潛水時， 看看水下的世界時，它是什麼樣的？ 其實我們看不了多遠"}, {"zh-tw": " Our vision, which works so well in air, all of a sudden is very restricted and claustrophobic. And what marine mammals have evolved over the last tens of millions of years is ways to depend on sound to both explore their world and also to stay in touch with one another.", "en": " 在地表上我們的視覺良好 但突然間 我們會在水下受到嚴重的限制與幽閉 而海洋哺乳動物 經過了近數千萬年來的進化後， 牠們依賴聲音 探索周圍的世界 並與其他同類保持聯繫"}, {"zh-tw": " Dolphins and toothed whales use echolocation. They can produce loud clicks and listen for echoes from the sea floor in order to orient.", "en": " 海豚和齒鯨使用回聲定位 牠們能產生響亮的喀喇聲 並傾聽海底反射的回聲來定位"}, {"zh-tw": " They can listen for echoes from prey in order to decide where food is and to decide which one they want to eat. All marine mammals use sound for communication to stay in touch.", "en": " 牠們能通過獵物所反射的回聲 來確定牠們的食物在哪里， 並決定要吃什麽 所有海洋哺乳動物用聲音來保持相互聯繫"}, {"zh-tw": " So the large baleen whales will produce long, beautiful songs, which are used in reproductive advertisement for male and females, both to find one another and to select a mate. And mother and young and closely bonded animals use calls to stay in touch with one another, so sound is really critical for their lives.", "en": " 於是大型鬚鯨 能發出悠長美麗的歌聲， 這種歌聲被雌鯨和雄鯨用於尋求伴侶， 幫助牠們找到同類， 並且選擇配偶 呼叫的聲音也被用於母子之間的聯繫， 或者在聯繫緊密的動物之間保持聯繫 因此，聲音在牠們的生活中是非常重要的"}, {"zh-tw": " The first thing that got me interested in the sounds of these underwater animals, whose world was so foreign to me, was evidence from captive dolphins that captive dolphins could imitate human sounds. And I mentioned I'll use some visual representations of sounds.", "en": " 第一個引起我對這些海底動物的 聲音興趣的是， 這對我來說是個陌生的世界 從捕獲的海豚中 所發現的證據表示： 牠們能模仿人類的聲音 我說我會使用 一些聲音的視覺化圖像"}, {"zh-tw": " Here's the first example. This is a plot of frequency against time -- sort of like musical notation, where the higher notes are up higher and the lower notes are lower, and time goes this way.", "en": " 這是第一個例子 這是幅頻率對時間的圖表-- 有點像音符， 高處的標記表示頻率較高，低處的標記表示頻率較低， 時間朝這個方向流逝"}, {"zh-tw": " This is a picture of a trainer's whistle, a whistle a trainer will blow to tell a dolphin it's done the right thing and can come get a fish.

If you hummed this tune to your dog or cat and it hummed it back to you, you ought to be pretty surprised.", "en": " 這是一隻人工飼養的小海豚 模仿的 教練的哨聲 現在如果你對這你的貓貓或狗狗哼這個曲子， 而牠也對著你哼這曲子， 你應該會大吃一驚。"}, {"zh-tw": " Very few nonhuman mammals can imitate sounds. It's really important for our music and our language.", "en": " 很少有除人類之外的哺乳動物 能模仿聲音 這種能力對我們學習音樂和語言十分重要。"}, {"zh-tw": " So it's a puzzle: The few other mammal groups that do this, why do they do it? A lot of my career has been devoted to trying to understand how these animals use their learning, use the ability to change what you say based on what you hear in their own communication systems. So let's start with calls of a nonhuman primate.", "en": " 因此這讓人迷惑：少有其他哺乳動物能做到這點， 為什麼牠們能做到這點？ 我職業生涯中花了很多時間 試圖弄明白 這些哺乳動物如何運用牠們的學習能力 運用此一能力： 基於所聽到的改變所說的。 這些都在牠們自己的溝通系統中 那麼讓我們從非人靈長類的叫聲開始"}, {"zh-tw": " Many mammals have to produce contact calls when, say, a mother and calf are apart. This is an example of a call produced by squirrel monkeys when they're isolated from another one.", "en": " 許多哺乳動物會發出呼喚聲 比如說，當母親和幼兒分開時 這是一個例子：這是松鼠猴 與其他同類分開時所發出的叫聲。"}, {"zh-tw": " And you can see, there's not much variability in these calls. By contrast, the signature whistle which dolphins use to stay in touch, each individual here has a radically different call.", "en": " 如你們所見，在這些叫聲中 沒有多少變化 相對地，海豚用於 保持聯繫的哨聲， 每一隻海豚都有完全不同的聲調"}, {"zh-tw": " They can use this ability to learn calls in order to develop more complicated and more distinctive calls to identify individuals. How about the setting in which animals need to use this call? Well let's look at mothers and calves.", "en": " 牠們用這種能力來學習叫聲， 以便能發展出更複雜、更獨特的聲納 來辨別不同的個體 在怎樣的環境下 動物必須使用這種叫聲？ 好，讓我們看看母親和幼海豚"}, {"zh-tw": " In normal life for mother and calf dolphin, they'll often drift apart or swim apart if Mom is chasing a fish, and when they separate they have to get back together again. What this figure shows is the percentage of the separations in which dolphins whistle, against the maximum distance.", "en": " 在海豚媽媽和海豚幼兒平常的生活中， 如果海豚媽媽去抓魚，牠們經常因為漂移或是游泳而分開 當牠們分開時 必須重新聚在一起 這張圖顯示，牠們分開時 海豚發出哨聲的百分比， 與此相對的是最遠距離"}, {"zh-tw": " So when dolphins are separating by less than 20 meters, less than half the time they need to use whistles. Most of the time they can just find each other just by swimming around.", "en": " 因此，當海豚分隔少於 20 公尺時， 低於半數的情況下，牠們需要用到哨聲 大多數時間，牠們四處遊動 就能找到對方"}, {"zh-tw": " But all of the time when they separate by more than 100 meters, they need to use these individually distinctive whistles to come back together again. Most of these distinctive signature whistles are quite stereotyped and stable through the life of a dolphin.", "en": " 然而一旦牠們分開超過100公尺， 牠們就需要使用這些各自獨特的哨聲 再次聚在一塊。 多數這類帶有獨特個別特徵的哨聲 在海豚的一生中 都是定型的、而且非常穩定"}, {"zh-tw": " But there are some exceptions. When a male dolphin leaves Mom, it will often join up with another male and form an alliance, which may last for decades.", "en": " 但也有些例外 當雄海豚離開海豚媽媽時， 牠通常會聯合另一隻雄海豚 形成一個聯盟，這一聯盟可能會持續幾十年之久"}, {"zh-tw": " As these two animals form a social bond, their distinctive whistles actually converge and become very similar. This plot shows two members of a pair.", "en": " 由於這兩隻動物形成了一條社會紐帶， 牠們獨特的哨聲實際上會進行融合 變得非常相似 這張圖顯示了組合中的兩個成員，"}, {"zh-tw": " As you can see at the top here, they share an up-sweep, like \"woop, woop, woop.\" They both have that kind of up-sweep. Whereas these members of a pair go \"wo-ot, wo-ot, wo-ot.\" And what's happened is they've used this learning process to develop a new sign that identifies this new social group.", "en": " 正如你們於頂部所看到的， 牠們有著同樣的上升調，像“woop，woop，woop“ 牠們都有這樣的上升調 然而，另一對成員擁有的上升調是”wo-ot, wo-ot, wo-ot“ 這是由於： 牠們運用此一學習過程 發展出識別新社會群體的新信號"}, {"zh-tw": " It's a very interesting way that they can form a new identifier for the new social group that they've had. Let's now take a step back and see what this message can tell us about protecting dolphins from human disturbance.", "en": " 這是非常有趣的方式，牠們可以 為新的社會群體 形塑一個新的識別標誌 現在讓我們退後一步 看看這訊息能告訴我們些什麼 關於保護海豚 遠離人類干擾的資訊"}, {"zh-tw": " Anybody looking at this picture will know this dolphin is surrounded, and clearly his behavior is being disrupted. This is a bad situation.", "en": " 任何看到這張圖片的人都知道 這隻海豚被包圍了， 顯然牠的行為被打亂了。 這是個糟糕的情況。"}, {"zh-tw": " But it turns out that when just a single boat is approaching a group of dolphins at a couple hundred meters away, the dolphins will start whistling, they'll change what they're doing, they'll have a more cohesive group, wait for the boat to go by, and then they'll get back to normal business. Well, in a place like Sarasota, Florida, the average interval between times that a boat is passing within a hundred meters of a dolphin group is six minutes.", "en": " 但事實表明， 當僅有一艘船在數百公尺外 靠近一群海豚時， 這些海豚會開始發出哨聲， 牠們會放棄正在做的事，聚集成更大的群體， 等待這艘船駛過， 然後回復正常 嗯，在一個佛羅里達州 Sarasota 的地方， 一艘船在百公尺之內 駛過一群海豚的 平均間隔時間 是六分鐘"}, {"zh-tw": " So even in the situation that doesn't look as bad as this, it's still affecting the amount of time these animals have to do their normal work. And if we look at a very pristine environment like western Australia, Lars Bider has done work comparing dolphin behavior and distribution before there were dolphin-watching boats.", "en": " 因此，即使在看起來不像這麼糟糕的情形下， 在多數時刻，仍然會對這些動物的 正常生活造成影響 讓我們看看像澳洲西部這樣一個非常原始的環境， Lars Bider 曾經 比較了賞海豚的遊船產生之前和之後， 當地海豚的行為與分佈"}, {"zh-tw": " When there was one boat, not much of an impact. And two boats: When the second boat was added, what happened was that some of the dolphins left the area completely.", "en": " 當只有一艘船時，對牠們的影響不大 兩艘船時，當第二艘船駛來時， 有些海豚 完全離開了這一區域"}, {"zh-tw": " Of the ones that stayed, their reproductive rate declined. So it could have a negative impact on the whole population.", "en": " 留下的那些海豚的繁殖率下降了 因此，這可能對整個群體數量產生負面影響"}, {"zh-tw": " When we think of marine-protected areas for animals like dolphins, this means that we have to be quite conscious about activities that we thought were benign. We may need to regulate the intensity of recreational boating and actual whale watching in order to prevent these kinds of problems.", "en": " 當我們考慮動物比如海豚建立海洋保護區時， 這意味著我們也要 非常慎重地考慮那些我們認為無礙的活動 我們也許需要控制 遊船的密度，甚至賞鯨船的密度， 以防類似問題的發生"}, {"zh-tw": " I'd also like to point out that sound doesn't obey boundaries. So you can draw a line to try to protect an area, but chemical pollution and noise pollution will continue to move through the area.", "en": " 同樣，我想指出那些 沒有辦法設置防線的因素：聲音 你可以畫一條線，試圖保護一個區域， 但是化學污染和噪音污染 將不斷進入這一區域。"}, {"zh-tw": " And I'd like to switch now from this local, familiar, coastal environment to a much broader world of the baleen whales and the open ocean. This is a kind of map we've all been looking at.", "en": " 現在，我想從這種地方性的、 為人熟知的沿海環境轉換至 鬚鯨的更廣闊的大海 我們經常看到這類地圖"}, {"zh-tw": " The world is mostly blue. But I'd also like to point out that the oceans are much more connected than we think.", "en": " 世界大部分是藍色的 但我還想指出的是，海洋之間的 聯繫地比我們所想像的更加緊密。"}, {"zh-tw": " Notice how few barriers there are to movement across all of the oceans compared to land. To me, the most mind-bending example of the interconnectedness of the ocean comes from an acoustic experiment where oceanographers took a ship to the southern Indian Ocean, deployed an underwater loudspeaker and played back a sound.", "en": " 請注意，相較於陸地而言，對海洋間的 運動的阻礙非常的少。 對我來說，最令人驚訝的海洋間 的相互聯繫的例子 來自一個海洋學家所做的 聲音實驗， 實驗中，海洋學家行駛至南印度洋， 放置一個水下揚聲器 並不斷播放一個聲音。"}, {"zh-tw": " That same sound traveled to the west, and could be heard in Bermuda, and traveled to the east, and could be heard in Monterey -- the same sound. So we live in a world of satellite communication, are used to global communication, but it's still amazing to me.", "en": " 同一段聲音 向西能傳播至百慕達群島， 向東能傳播至蒙特雷（Monterey）-- 同一段聲音。 雖然我們生活在一個衛星通信的世界裏， 早已習慣了全球間的溝通， 但我仍然感到驚訝"}, {"zh-tw": " The ocean has properties that allow low-frequency sound to basically move globally. The acoustic transit time for each of these paths is about three hours.", "en": " 海洋擁有了，基本上 能讓低頻聲音 傳遍全球的特性。 聲音通過這些途徑中的每一條進行傳播所需的時間大約是三小時。"}, {"zh-tw": " It's nearly halfway around the globe. In the early '70s, Roger Payne and an ocean acoustician published a theoretical paper pointing out that it was possible that sound could transmit over these large areas, but very few biologists believed it.", "en": " 這幾乎穿越了半個地球。 在70年代早期， 一名海洋聲學家，Roger Payne 曾發表過一篇學術論文， 論文中指出 聲音能夠在大範圍內傳播， 但少有生物學家相信這點。"}, {"zh-tw": " It actually turns out, though, even though we've only known of long-range propagation for a few decades, the whales clearly have evolved, over tens of millions of years, a way to exploit this amazing property of the ocean. So blue whales and fin whales produce very low-frequency sounds that can travel over very long ranges.", "en": " 事實上， 雖然我們近幾十年來才對這種遠距離傳播有所瞭解， 而鯨魚顯然在數千萬年之前就已經 進行了進化， 進化出一種方法來運用海洋的這種驚奇特性， 藍鯨和長鬚鯨 產生一種頻率非常低的聲音， 這種聲音能傳播很長的距離，"}, {"zh-tw": " The top plot here shows a complicated series of calls that are repeated by males. They form songs, and they appear to play a role in reproduction, sort of like that of song birds.", "en": " 上面這幅圖顯示 雄鯨所重複的 一系列複雜的叫聲。 這些叫聲形成歌聲，並且似乎能在繁殖中發揮作用， 有點類似鳥類的啼聲。"}, {"zh-tw": " Down below here, we see calls made by both males and females that also carry over very long ranges. The biologists continued to be skeptical of the long-range communication issue well past the '70s, until the end of the Cold War.", "en": " 下面這幅圖，我們看到 無論是雄性還是雌性發出的叫聲 都能傳播很遠的距離。 生物學家在70年代 持續地懷疑 遠距離溝通的問題， 直到冷戰結束為止。"}, {"zh-tw": " What happened was, during the Cold War, the U.S. Navy had a system that was secret at the time, that they used to track Russian submarines. It had deep underwater microphones, or hydrophones, cabled to shore, all wired back to a central place that could listen to sounds over the whole North Atlantic.", "en": " 冷戰期間，美國海軍 開發出一套在當時處於保密的系統， 這套系統能夠探測俄國潛艇， 它有一個深水麥克風，或者說，一個水下測音器， 水下測音器用纜線連接至海岸， 所有纜線連接至一個中心，在那兒能監聽 所有穿過整個北大西洋的聲音。"}, {"zh-tw": " And after the Berlin Wall fell, the Navy made these systems available to whale bio-acousticians to see what they could hear.

This shows us both that the calls are detectable over hundreds of miles and that whales routinely swim hundreds of miles.", "en": " 牠被跟蹤了43天， 游了1700公里， 或者說超過1000英里。 這告訴我們，這些叫聲 能在數百英里外被探測出來， 這些鯨魚經常遊出數百英里遠。"}, {"zh-tw": " They're ocean-based and scale animals who are communicating over much longer ranges than we had anticipated. Unlike fins and blues, which disperse into the temperate and tropical oceans, the humpbacked whales congregate in local traditional breeding grounds, so they can make a sound that's a little higher in frequency, broader-band and more complicated.", "en": " 牠們是海洋大型動物， 能夠以遠遠超出人們預期的距離 進行溝通。 牠們與分佈在溫帶和熱帶的 鬚鯨和藍鯨不同， 座頭鯨聚集於 傳統繁殖地， 因此牠們能發出頻率更高的聲音， 音域更寬且更複雜。"}, {"zh-tw": " So you're listening to the complicated song produced by humpbacks here. Humpbacks, when they develop the ability to sing this song, they're listening to other whales and modifying what they sing based on what they're hearing, just like song birds or the dolphin whistles I described.", "en": " 你們現在聽到的是座頭鯨 發出的複雜歌聲。 當座頭鯨發展出 這樣的歌聲能力時， 牠們就能聽到來自其他鯨魚的聲音了， 並且基於牠們所聽到的來改變音調， 就像鳥的啼聲或我描述的海豚哨聲。"}, {"zh-tw": " This means that humpback song is a form of animal culture, just like music for humans would be. I think one of the most interesting examples of this comes from Australia.", "en": " 這表示了座頭鯨的歌聲 是動物文化的一種形式， 就像音樂對於人類一般。 我認為，關於這些最有趣的例子 來自澳洲。"}, {"zh-tw": " Biologists on the east coast of Australia were recording the songs of humpbacks in that area. And this orange line here marks the typical songs of east coast humpbacks.", "en": " 生物學家在澳洲東海岸 錄下了那一區域的座頭鯨的歌聲， 這條橘色的線顯示了東海岸座頭鯨 的典型歌聲。"}, {"zh-tw": " In '95 they all sang the normal song.

They just sang the cool new west coast song.", "en": " 西海岸的叫聲變得越來越常見， 直到1998年， 再也沒有鯨魚發出東海岸的歌聲，它完全消失了， 牠們都在唱著新的西海岸的酷歌。"}, {"zh-tw": " It's as if some new hit style had completely wiped out the old-fashioned style before, and with no golden oldies stations. Nobody sang the old ones.", "en": " 這仿佛是一種新的風格 完全取代了 之前舊的時尚風格， 而且沒有金曲再現這一檔事， 沒人想唱老歌了。"}, {"zh-tw": " I'd like to briefly just show what the ocean does to these calls.
