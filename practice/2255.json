Now, before we get into the why would anyone ever want to surfin freezing cold water? I would love to give youa little perspective on what a day in my life can look like.", "en": " 它猛然把我們導引到 一個無形的感官世界，就像冥想一樣。” 如果顫抖是冥想的一種形式，那我就是一個修道士 （笑） 在我們談論 為甚麼會有人想要在寒冷刺骨的水中衝浪之前 我想讓你們知道一些 我每天生活的樣子"}, {"zh-tw": " (Music) (Video) Man: I mean, I knowwe were hoping for good waves, but I don't think anybody thoughtthat was going to happen.

See, I gave a piece of myselfin these places, and what I walked away with was a sense of fulfillmentI had always been searching for.", "en": " 追求任何值得的事物都需要吃苦 吃一點苦 我為了攝影而吃的那一點苦 它增加了我工作的價值，對我來說 我不再只是從事一份填滿雜誌版面的工作 了解嗎， 我貢獻出我的一部份給這些地方 而我離開所獲得的 是我一直夢寐以求的滿足感"}, {"zh-tw": " So I look back at this photograph. It's easy to see frozen fingersand cold wetsuits and even the strugglethat it took just to get there, but most of all,what I see is just joy.", "en": " 所以我回顧這張照片 上面很容易看到凍僵的手指和冰冷的潛水衣 以及為了到達那個地方所花費的努力 但最重要的是, 我看到了喜悅"}, {"zh-tw": " Thank you so much.", "en": " 非常謝謝你們 (鼓掌)"}], "title": "Chris Burkard The Joy Of Surfing In Ice Cold Water"}
