We'd actually met online before -- not the way you're thinking."}, {"zh-tw": "其實我們遇見是因為我們都認識琳達.埃維她是最早的線上私人基因組公司的創始人之一。因為琳達知道我們兩人的基因訊息所以她發現我們兩個都有一種罕見的線粒體DNA叫做單倍體基因型 K1a 1b 1a這說明了我們是遠親。其實我們和冰人奧茲也有血緣關係", "en": "We were actually introduced because we both knew Linda Avey, one of the founders of the first online personal genomic companies. And because we shared our genetic information with Linda, she could see that Harriet and I shared a very rare type of mitochondrial DNA -- Haplotype K1a1b1a -- which meant that we were distantly related."}, {"zh-tw": "所以，奧茲、哈裏特和我算是親戚。因為現在大家都使用臉書，我們當然也設立了自己的臉書群組。", "en": "We actually share the same genealogy with Ozzie the iceman. So Ozzie, Harriet and me."}, {"zh-tw": "我們歡迎你們加入。隔年當我在TED會議上遇到哈里特時", "en": "And being the current day, of course, we started our own Facebook group. You're all welcome to join."}, {"zh-tw": "她早就已經上網訂做了我們自己的快樂單倍體T恤。為什麼我要告訴你們這件事呢?這和我們未來的健康又有什麼關係呢?我和哈裏特相遇的過程其實充分地說明了一件事那就是跨學科的研究、突飛猛進的科技正影響我們將來的身心健康——這些研究和科技包含了低成本的基因分析有能力運用功能強大的生物信息學以及網路和社會網絡之間的關聯。今天我想談的就是我們應該了解這些指數科技。我們的思考經常是直線的。但是你想像一下，如果你有一片蓮花葉子", "en": "And when I met Harriet in person the next year at the TED Conference, she'd gone online and ordered our own happy Haplotype T-shirts. Now why am I telling you this story, and what does this have to do with the future of health? Well the way I met Harriet is actually an example of how leveraging cross-disciplinary, exponentially-growing technologies is affecting our future of health and wellness -- from low-cost gene analysis to the ability to do powerful bio-informatics to the connection of the Internet and social networking."}, {"zh-tw": "而且它每天都分裂一次兩片，四片，八片，十六片15天後你就有三萬兩千片葉子。", "en": "What I'd like to talk about today is understanding these exponential technologies. We often think linearly."}, {"zh-tw": "那一個月後你認為會有多少葉子？答案是10億。所以如果我們開始學著「次方性思考」我們就可以讓我們身邊所有的科技有所不同。許多這些科技，就我醫生的角色和想創新的人來說，是我們真的能用來改變我們未來的健康以及保健發展", "en": "But if you think about it, if you have a lily pad and it just divided every single day -- two, four, eight, 16 -- in 15 days you have 32,000. What do you think you have in a month? We're at a billion."}, {"zh-tw": "解決我們現今在保健發展遇到的主要難題例如說保健制度的巨額成本老年人口沒能非常有效地運用資訊、整合保健制度還有採用創新技術時過程也經常是困難重重。我們能做的一件重要的事，這我們今天也剛談了一些就是把這條曲線向左移。我們把大多數金錢花費在生命階段的最後百分之二十。如果我們將錢花在保健制度和我們自身的健康管理中透過科技親自參予這些系統運作和管理將曲線向左移、改善我們的健康，那會怎樣呢？", "en": "So if we start to think exponentially, we can see how this is starting to affect all the technologies around us. And many of these technologies -- speaking as a physician and innovator -- we can really start to leverage to impact the future of our own health and of health care, and to address many of the major challenges that we have in health care today, ranging from the really exponential costs to the aging population, the way we really don't use information very well today, the fragmentation of care and often the very difficult course of adoption of innovation."}, {"zh-tw": "我最喜歡的科技是「次方科技」我們大家現在都在使用這種科技了。想想看，這些科技現在正突飛猛進。", "en": "And one of the major things we can do we've talked a bit about here today is moving the curve to the left. We spend most of our money on the last 20 percent of life."}, {"zh-tw": "打個比方，iPhone4已經是這樣了想像一下iPhone8的功能會有多強大。我對這項技術已經有一些心得。我在矽谷一家辛格蘭若堤大學的醫學部門工作我們會在每個夏天從全世界找來一百個傑出的學生研究這些關於醫學，生物科技人工智能，機器人技術，納米技術，空間技術的整合科技，", "en": "What if we could spend and incentivize positions in the health care system and our own self to move the curve to the left and improve our health, leveraging technology as well? Now my favorite technology, example of exponential technology, we all have in our pocket. So if you think about it, these are really dramatically improving."}, {"zh-tw": "解決跨學科訓練的問題並利用這些技術來影響還沒有實現的重大目標。", "en": "I mean this is the iPhone 4. Imagine what the iPhone 8 will be able to do."}, {"zh-tw": "我們也有七天的執行計畫。接下來的幾個月是「未來醫學」這個計畫能協助跨學科訓練並將技術運用到醫學上。我剛提到了手機。", "en": "Now, I've gained some insight into this. I've been the track share for the medicine portion of a new institution called Singularity University based in Silicon Valley."}, {"zh-tw": "這些手機擁有超過兩萬個不同的應用程序甚至英國還設計了一種應用程式你可以把一片小晶片連上你的 iPhone，然後在晶片上小便看看你是不是得了性病。我不知道我會不會試，不過是有這樣的程式可以用。還有其他的應用程式能讓手機有診斷功能。", "en": "And we bring together every summer about 100 very talented students from around the world. And we look at these exponential technologies from medicine, biotech, artificial intelligence, robotics, nanotechnology, space, and address how can we cross-train and leverage these to impact major unmet goals."}, {"zh-tw": "例如說如果你有糖尿病你可以用iPhone來測量血脂然後把數據發給你的醫師", "en": "We also have seven-day executive programs. And coming up next month is actually Future Med, a program to help cross-train and leverage technologies into medicine."}, {"zh-tw": "所以你和醫生都能更了解你的血糖狀況。讓我們看看整合科技是如何應用在保健用途上。讓我們從速度開始。", "en": "Now I mentioned the phone. These mobile phones have over 20,000 different mobile apps available -- to the point where there's one out of the U.K."}, {"zh-tw": "我們都知道，就如摩爾定律所說的電腦運作的速度越來越快了。所以我們能夠運用它們來做更多事。", "en": "where you can pee on a little chip connected to your iPhone and check yourself for an STD. I don't know if I'd try that yet, but that's available."}, {"zh-tw": "電腦的能力越來越接近人腦的能力很多情況下甚至超越了人腦。但我認為電腦的速度對成像技術的好處最大。這種用非常高畫素即時地呈現身體內部的技術進步真的是越來越驚人。我們正在綜合多種技術, PET掃描、CT掃描和分子診斷來發現和尋找所在位置不同的東西。", "en": "There are all other sorts of applications, merging your phone and diagnostics, for example -- measuring your blood glucose on your iPhone and sending that, potentially, to your physician so they can better understand and you can better understand your blood sugars as a diabetic. So let's see now how exponential technologies are taking health care."}, {"zh-tw": "你現在看到的是今天MRI掃描技術以極高畫素重建的馬克.霍頓希的頭像他是TED醫學會議的管理者。現在我們可以以前所未有的的像素和能力來看大腦內部", "en": "Let's start with faster. Well it's no secret that computers, through Moore's law, are speeding up faster and faster."}, {"zh-tw": "從根本上學會如何重建、甚至重新設計、或是逆向設計大腦因此我們能更了解病變，疾病和治療方法。我們能用fMRI即時來觀察大腦內部。", "en": "We have the ability to do more powerful things with them. They're really approaching, in many cases surpassing, the ability of the human mind."}, {"zh-tw": "通過理解這些過程和聯繫我們能夠瞭解藥物和冥想所帶來的影響改善個人化治療、提高功效例如說，更符合個人需求、更有效的精神藥物。", "en": "But where I think computational speed is most applicable is in that of imaging. The ability now to look inside the body in real time with very high resolution is really becoming incredible."}, {"zh-tw": "fMR用的掃描器現在變得更小更輕便，也不像過去那樣昂貴。從這些掃描器得到的數據實在太多很快地會造成很大的問題。現在的掃描佔用了800本書的空間或者20G。幾年後的掃描將會佔用1T或者800000本書的空間。", "en": "And we're layering multiple technologies -- PET scans, CT scans and molecular diagnostics -- to find and to seek things at different levels. Here you're going to see the very highest resolution MRI scan done today, reconstructed of Marc Hodosh, the curator of TEDMED."}, {"zh-tw": "我們該如何去利用這些信息呢？讓我們從自己的例子說起吧。我不會問這裡誰做過結腸檢查，但是如果你大於50歲，那麼該是你檢查結腸的時候了。你怎麼避開結腸鏡的尖端呢？現在有一種虛擬的結腸鏡檢查。比較這兩張圖，作為放射科醫生你可以檢查你病人結腸的內部", "en": "And now we can see inside of the brain with a resolution and ability that was never before available, and essentially learn how to reconstruct, and maybe even re-engineer, or backwards engineer, the brain so we can better understand pathology, disease and therapy. We can look inside with real time fMRI -- in the brain at real time."}, {"zh-tw": "藉由人工智慧的協助找出可能受傷的部位，就像你在這裡所看到的損傷。我們以前可能會錯過這種損傷，但是藉由在放射科中用人工智能我們能找到我們以前沒發現的損傷。這可能會讓以前不願做結腸檢查的人願意檢查。", "en": "And by understanding these sorts of processes and these sorts of connections, we're going to understand the effects of medication or meditation and better personalize and make effective, for example, psychoactive drugs. The scanners for these are getting small, less expensive and more portable."}, {"zh-tw": "這是一個診療方式轉變的例子。我們正朝向一個生物醫學、信息技術和無線網路的整合時代而且我會說是「整合機動式」時代，也就是數位醫學的時代。", "en": "And this sort of data explosion available from these is really almost becoming a challenge. The scan of today takes up about 800 books, or 20 gigabytes."}, {"zh-tw": "所以甚至我的聽診器都是數位的。當然，它有個應用程序。我們正走向《星際奇航記》裡出現的那個「影音分析儀」的時代。這種手持超音波儀器正超越而且取代聽診器。", "en": "The scan in a couple of years will be one terabyte, or 800,000 books. How do you leverage that information? Let's get personal. I won't ask who here's had a colonoscopy, but if you're over age 50, it's time for your screening colonoscopy."}, {"zh-tw": "這種儀器過去的價位是十萬英鎊或幾十萬美元現在只要大約五千美元我就能買得起這樣一個功能強大的診斷儀器。我們正把這個裝置和電子醫療記錄結合起來在美國，電子化醫療紀錄仍然少於百分之二十。我想在荷蘭應該高於百分之八十。", "en": "How would you like to avoid the pointy end of the stick? Well now there's essentially a virtual colonoscopy. Compare those two pictures, and now as a radiologist, you can essentially fly through your patient's colon and, augmenting that with artificial intelligence, identify potentially, as you see here, a lesion."}, {"zh-tw": "但是我們現在轉到結合醫療數據，把數據電子化，如此我們就能整合資訊。現在作為一名醫生，不論在哪裡", "en": "Oh, we might have missed it, but using A.I. on top of radiology, we can find lesions that were missed before. And maybe this will encourage people to get colonoscopies that wouldn't have otherwise."}, {"zh-tw": "透過這些移動設備，我就能得到病人的數據。當然，我們正處在iPad,甚至iPad2的時代。就在上個月美國食品藥品管理局首度通過的應用程序", "en": "And this is an example of this paradigm shift. We're moving to this integration of biomedicine, information technology, wireless and, I would say, mobile now -- this era of digital medicine."}, {"zh-tw": "證實可以讓放射科醫生直接在這些設備上讀數據。所以肯定的是，現今的醫生，包括我自己", "en": "So even my stethoscope is now digital. And of course, there's an app for that."}, {"zh-tw": "已經完全離不開這些設備了。正如你們大約一個月前所看到的來自IBM的華生在益智節目「危險邊緣」中擊敗了兩位冠軍。", "en": "We're moving, obviously, to the era of the tricorder. So the handheld ultrasound is basically surpassing and supplanting the stethoscope."}, {"zh-tw": "因此我要你們想像當我們在幾年內開始採用雲端資訊並真正有了人工智慧醫生連接到我們的大腦我們做的決定和診斷會和過去全然不同。你們現在在很多情況下已經不需要去看醫生了。只有大約百分之二十的狀況下醫生才會用到手來做診療。我們正處在虛擬診療的時代", "en": "These are now at a price point of -- what used to be 100,000 euros or a couple of hundred-thousand dollars -- for about 5,000 dollars, I can have the power of a very powerful diagnostic device in my hand. And merging this now with the advent of electronic medical records -- in the United States, we're still less than 20 percent electronic."}, {"zh-tw": "從使用Skype到American Well來做線上看病到思科研製的非常精密的健康診斷系統。這種和你的醫師的互動能力是有別於以往的。現在因為有這些設備我們的能力更是提高了。這是我的朋友傑西卡傳給我的她頭部裂傷的圖片所以她不用來急診室，我能通過看照片來診斷。", "en": "Here in the Netherlands, I think it's more than 80 percent. But now that we're switching to merging medical data, making it available electronically, we can crowd source that information, and now as a physician, I can access my patients' data from wherever I am just through my mobile device."}, {"zh-tw": "或許我們能利用現今的遊戲技術比如微軟Kinect來進行診斷。例如在診斷中風時，用簡單的移動偵測儀器和幾百元的設備就可以進行檢測。", "en": "And now, of course, we're in the era of the iPad, even the iPad 2. And just last month the first FDA-approved application was approved to allow radiologists to do actual reading on these sorts of devices."}, {"zh-tw": "我們現在實際上能用機器人來看病。如果我是一名血液病專家可以用這台RP7到另一家診所或醫院看診。這種能提升診療效率的整套工具其實現在在家就找的到。所以想像一下，我們已經擁有無線網路體重計。你可以站在體重計上你可以把你的體重用Tweet告訴你的朋友，他們能幫你保持身材。我們有無線網絡血壓器。我們正在整合這所有的技術。", "en": "So certainly, the physicians of today, including myself, are completely reliable on these devices. And as you saw just about a month ago, Watson from IBM beat the two champions in \"Jeopardy.\" So I want you to imagine when in a couple of years, when we've started to apply this cloud-based information, when we really have the A.I. physician and leverage our brains to connectivity to make decisions and diagnostics at a level never done."}, {"zh-tw": "所以我們不用戴這些雜七雜八的裝置，而是可以把他們變成一個貼片。這是我在史丹福的一個同事發明的iRhythm。", "en": "Already today, you don't need to go to your physician in many cases. Only for about 20 percent of actual visits do you have to lay hands on the patient."}, {"zh-tw": "它完全取代了先前的技術，而且價格低很多，效率更好。現在我們正處於自我量化的時代。人們可以買幾百元的裝置像這個小FitBit。", "en": "We're now in the era of virtual visits -- from sort of the Skype-type visits you can do with American Well, to Cisco that's developed a very complex health presence system. The ability to interact with your health care provider is different."}, {"zh-tw": "我可以量化我的步數和我的卡路里消耗。我可以每天都從這些數據了解一些事情。我可以把數據和朋友，醫生分享。", "en": "And these are being augmented even by our devices again today. Here my friend Jessica sent me a picture of her head laceration so I can save her a trip to the emergency room -- I can do some diagnostics that way."}, {"zh-tw": "現在有一種手錶可以測量你的心律，叫Zeo睡眠偵測器。它能讓你使用這些資訊對自身的健康更了解。當我們開始整合這些資訊我們就會更知道用它做什麼，更了解我們的病狀和身心健康。現在甚至有一種鏡子可以測量你的脈搏率。我認為，在未來，我們衣服裡會有可以穿戴的裝置全天候檢測我們的身體。就像我們現在車裏的OnStar系統，", "en": "Or might we be able to leverage today's gaming technology, like the Microsoft Kinect, and hack that to enable diagnostics, for example, in diagnosing stroke, using simple motion detection, using hundred-dollar devices. We can actually now visit our patients robotically -- this is the RP7; if I'm a hematologist, visit another clinic, visit a hospital."}, {"zh-tw": "紅燈會亮起，雖然它不會說「去檢查引擎」但它會說去「檢查你的身體」", "en": "These will be augmented by a whole suite of tools actually in the home now. So imagine we already have wireless scales."}, {"zh-tw": "回家好好照顧自己。也許幾年後", "en": "You can step on the scale. You can Tweet your weight to your friends, and they can keep you in line."}, {"zh-tw": "你照鏡子時鏡子會幫你看病。家裡有小孩的", "en": "We have wireless blood pressure cuffs. A whole gamut of these technologies are being put together."}, {"zh-tw": "你會想要這種會幫你的無線尿布吧...我想你不需要這麼多資訊。但是這一天會來的。今天我們已經聽了很多新技術和技術整合。", "en": "So instead of wearing these kludgy devices, we can put on a simple patch. This was developed by colleagues at Stanford, called the iRhythm -- completely supplants the prior technology at a much lower price point with much more effectivity."}, {"zh-tw": "我認為有些技術會使我們和病人更接近有更多時間表達我們對病人的關懷。這些技術能夠提供這樣的幫助。", "en": "Now we're also in the era, today, of quantified self. Consumers now can buy basically hundred-dollar devices, like this little FitBit."}, {"zh-tw": "我們談到了一些能幫助患者的科技那麼科技如何幫助醫生呢？", "en": "I can measure my steps, my caloric outtake. I can get insight into that on a daily basis."}, {"zh-tw": "我們正處在「超強化外科醫生」的時代。他們能進入身體內部用機器人做手術，這現在已經可以做到了。這種水平即使是短短五年前都不太可能達到的。", "en": "I can share that with my friends, with my physician. There's watches coming out that will measure your heart rate, the Zeo sleep monitors, a whole suite of tools that can enable you to leverage and have insight into your own health."}, {"zh-tw": "現在這種技術還因為多重影像技術，例如「增像技術」得到提升。所以醫生能通過他們的鏡頭看到患者的內部看腫瘤在哪裡，血管在哪裡。除此之外，「決策支持」這個技術也可以和「機器手術」做整合。", "en": "And as we start to integrate this information, we're going to know better what to do with it and how better to have insight into our own pathologies, health and wellness. There's even mirrors today that can pick up your pulse rate."}, {"zh-tw": "例如說，在紐約的醫生可以幫阿姆茲特丹的醫生。我們正在步入一個叫做NOTES的真正無疤手術的時代。機器內窺鏡能穿過胃部切除膽囊不會留下疤痕，過程也是機器化的。", "en": "And I would argue, in the future, we'll have wearable devices in our clothes, monitoring ourselves 24/7. And just like we have the OnStar system in cars, your red light might go on -- it won't say \"check engine\" though."}, {"zh-tw": "這是即將被採用的技術。基本上是一種無疤手術拜機器化手術之賜。除了控制機器手，我們還能控制其他東西嗎？對於身障人士，那些半身不遂的人", "en": "It's going to be \"check your body\" light, and go in and get it taken care of. Probably in a few years, you'll check into your mirror and it's going to be diagnosing you."}, {"zh-tw": "有一種能讓人腦和電腦互動的技術叫做BCI。在四肢癱瘓者的大腦皮層運動區植入晶片他們就能控制滑鼠指標、輪椅或者機器手臂。", "en": "For those of you with kiddos at home, how would you like to have the wireless diaper that supports your ... too much information, I think, than you might need."}, {"zh-tw": "這些晶片現在做得越來越小越來越多患者體內都能夠放入這種晶片。", "en": "But it's going to be here. Now we've heard a lot today about new technology and connection."}, {"zh-tw": "這種技術仍在臨床階段，但想像一下當我們將這些技術結合令人驚歎的仿生學假肢像卡門院長和他的同事設計的DEKA手臂有17種不同的移動方式和靈活度能使失去肢體的人比以前更靈巧。我們實際上真正進入到了可穿的機器人時代。", "en": "And I think some of these technologies will enable us to be more connected with our patients, and take more time and actually do the important human touch elements of medicine, as augmented by these sorts of technologies. Now we've talked about augmenting the patient, to some degree."}, {"zh-tw": "如果你手腳完好，但是你得了中風你可以穿這些假肢。或者假如你下半身癱瘓，像我在巴克力仿生物公司拜訪的朋友們他們發明了eLEGS。我上週拍了這段影片。影片中這位半身癱瘓的人因為穿上這些仿生裝備正在走路。如果不穿這些盔甲，他完全得依賴輪椅。這些機器裝備現在還在發展初期。", "en": "How about augmenting the physician? We're now in the era of super-enabling the surgeon who can now go inside the body and do things with robotic surgery, which is here today, at a level that was not really possible even five years ago. Now this is being augmented with further layers of technology like augmented reality."}, {"zh-tw": "我認為藉由這些技術我們能改變對殘疾的定義在某些情況下甚至能將「殘疾」轉變成「超能」。", "en": "So the surgeon can see inside the patient, through their lens, where the tumor is, where the blood vessels are. This can be integrated with decisions support."}, {"zh-tw": "這是艾米.馬林斯，她在小時候就失去了雙腿。這是休.赫爾，麻省理工的教授他也在一次攀岩事故中失去了雙腿。現在他們通過修復手術可以比正常人爬得更好，動得更快用不同的方式游泳。再說說其他的整合科技吧。", "en": "A surgeon in New York can be helping a surgeon in Amsterdam, for example. And we're entering an era of really, truly scarless surgery called NOTES, where the robotic endoscope can come out the stomach and pull out that gallbladder all in a scarless way and robotically."}, {"zh-tw": "很明顯地，肥胖趨勢朝著錯誤的方向快速發展包括肥胖症造成的支出也是越來越龐大。但是醫學儀器卻有種越做越迷你的趨勢。例如說，我們可以用這種電子藥丸來做一趟「奇幻航行」。你可以吞下這個麻雀雖小卻五臟俱全的裝置。當它通過你的消化道時能在消化道裡拍照，並且進行診斷和治療。我們還做了更小的微型機器人他們能自動通過你的消化系統", "en": "And this is called NOTES, and this is coming -- basically scarless surgery, as mediated by robotic surgery. Now how about controlling other elements? For those who have disabilities -- the paraplegic -- there's the era of brain-computer interface, or BCI, where chips have been put on the motor cortex of completely quadriplegic patients and they can control a curser or a wheelchair or, eventually, a robotic arm."}, {"zh-tw": "用一種更溫和的方式來做外科醫師做不到的事。有時這些裝置會在你的消化系統內自行組裝從而提升使用價值。在心臟儀器方面，起搏器越來越容易植入因此不需要訓練一位介入性心臟科醫師來植入這些儀器。你可以用移動裝置再次的無線遙控這些儀器。所以你可以去任何地方而不影響對儀器的遠程遙控。我們甚至還要把它做得更小。這是一個Medtrinic製作的樣品，比一分錢還小。", "en": "And these devices are getting smaller and going into more and more of these patients. Still in clinical trials, but imagine when we can connect these, for example, to the amazing bionic limb, such as the DEKA Arm built by Dean Kamen and colleagues, which has 17 degrees of motion and freedom and can allow the person who's lost a limb to have much higher levels of dexterity or control than they've had in the past."}, {"zh-tw": "另外，我們能將人工視網膜放到眼球後面使盲人回復視力。雖然這還在早期實驗階段，但成功的機率是很大的。", "en": "So we're really entering the era of wearable robotics actually. If you haven't lost a limb -- you've had a stroke, for example -- you can wear these augmented limbs."}, {"zh-tw": "這些將會是革命性的改變。或著對我們這些視力正常的人有了這些輔助生活的隱形眼鏡會怎樣？我們現在有藍牙、無線網絡，可以將圖像投射到你的眼睛。", "en": "Or if you're a paraplegic -- like I've visited the folks at Berkley Bionics -- they've developed eLEGS. I took this video last week. Here's a paraplegic patient actually walking by strapping on these exoskeletons."}, {"zh-tw": "如果你維持飲食有困難這些額外的圖像也許能提醒你食物裡有多少卡路里。", "en": "He's otherwise completely wheelchair-bound. And now this is the early era of wearable robotics."}, {"zh-tw": "如果病理學家能把他們的手機當做顯微鏡使用把資料傳回主機，進行更好的診斷，這會是怎樣的局面呢？實際上，現在整個實驗醫學界的情況已經完全改變了。我們現在能利用微流體像斯坦福大學的史提夫. 奎克做的這片晶片。微流體技術能取代整個實驗室的技術員。", "en": "And I think by leveraging these sorts of technologies, we're going to change the definition of disability to in some cases be superability, or super-enabling.

Geron, just last year, started the first trial using human embryonic stem cells to treat spinal cord injuries."}, {"zh-tw": "鞠躬，鞠躬。", "en": "Still a Phase I trial, but evolving. We've been actually using adult stem cells now in clinical trials for about 15 years to approach a whole range of topics, particularly in cardiovascular disease.We take our own bone marrow cells and treat a patient with a heart attack, we can see much improved heart function and actually better survival using our own bone marrow drive cells after a heart attack. I invented a device called the MarrowMiner, a much less invasive way for harvesting bone marrow.It's now been FDA approved, and it'll hopefully be on the market in the next year or so. Hopefully you can appreciate the device there curving through the patient's body and removing the patient's bone marrow, instead of with 200 punctures, with just a single puncture under local anesthesia.But where is stem cell therapy really going? If you think about it, every cell in your body has the same DNA as you had when you were an embryo. We can now reprogram your skin cells to actually act like a pluripotent embryonic stem cell and to utilize those potentially to treat multiple organs in that same patient -- making your own personalized stem cell lines.And I think they'll be a new era of your own stem cell banking to have in the freezer your own cardiac cells, myocytes and neural cells to use them in the future, should you need them. And we're integrating this now with a whole era of cellular engineering, and integrating exponential technologies for essentially 3D organ printing -- replacing the ink with cells and essentially building and reconstructing a 3D organ.That's where things are going to head -- still very early days. But I think, as integration of exponential technologies, this is the example.So in close, as you think about technology trends and how to impact health and medicine, we're entering an era of miniaturization, decentralization and personalization. And I think by pulling these things together, if we can start to think about how to understand and leverage these, we're going to empower the patient, enable the doctor, enhance wellness and begin to cure the well before they get sick.Because I know as a doctor, if someone comes to me with Stage I disease, I'm thrilled -- we can often cure them. But often it's too late and it's Stage III or IV cancer, for example.So by leveraging these technologies together, I think we'll enter a new era that I like to call Stage 0 medicine. And as a cancer doctor, I'm looking forward to being out of a job.Thanks very much. Host: Thank you. Thank you.Take a bow. Take a bow."}], "title": "Daniel Kraft Medicine S Future"}
