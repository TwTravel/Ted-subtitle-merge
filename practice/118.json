One of the earlier results that we got -- we have a Singaporean businessman who is now sponsoring a village of 25 Vietnamese girls for their education, and that was one of the earliest results.

Orkut had a vision to create a social network.", "en": " 這就是我們生產出大量產品的方法。 Orkut對於創造社群網路很有洞察力"}, {"zh-tw": " I know all of you are thinking, \"Yet another social network.\" But it was a dream of his, and we, basically, when people really want to do something, well, we generally let them. So this is what he built.", "en": " 我知道你們大家都在想：「又是另一個社群網路。」 但這是他們一個夢想，也是我們的 當人們很想要作一件事，好的，我們就會讓他們做 這就是他所建立的"}, {"zh-tw": " We just released it in a test phase last month, and it's been taking off. This is our VP of Engineering.", "en": " 我們上個月才剛發布測試階段的版本 也正在成長 這是我們工程部的副總"}, {"zh-tw": " You can see the red hair, and I don't know if you can see the nose ring there. And these are all of his friends.", "en": " 你可以看到他的紅頭髮，我不確定你能不能看到他的鼻環 這些都是他的朋友"}, {"zh-tw": " So this is how -- we just deployed it -- we just decided that people would send each other invitations to get into the service, and so we just had the people in our company initially send them out. And now we've grown to over 100,000 members.", "en": " 這就是我們如何部署 我們決定讓人們互相邀請使用這項服務 所以我們先從讓公司員工開始發送邀請 現在我們已成長到擁有超過100,000名會員"}, {"zh-tw": " And they spread, actually, very quickly, even outside the U.S. You can see, even though the U.S. is still the majority here -- though, by the way, search-wise, it's only about 30 percent of our traffic -- but it's already going to Japan, and the U.K., and Europe, and all the rest of the countries.", "en": " 事實上，這項服務甚至在美國以外的地方也擴展的相當快速 你們可以看到，儘管美國依然佔了大多數 附帶一提，再搜尋方面美國只佔了百分之30 但這項服務已擴及日本、英國和歐洲 以及其他各國"}, {"zh-tw": " So it's a fun little project. There are a variety of demographics. I won't bore you with these.", "en": " 這是個好玩的小計劃 這裡有許多種類的統計資料，我不會拿這些資料來讓你們無聊"}, {"zh-tw": " But it's just the kind of thing that we just try out for fun and see where it goes. And -- well, I'll leave you in suspense.", "en": " 這些不過是一些為了好玩而嘗試的數據 還能看看進展的如何 然後 嗯，我將替你賣點關子"}, {"zh-tw": " Larry, you can explain this one. Larry Page: Thank you, Sergey.", "en": " Larry，你可以解釋一下這個 Larry Page：謝謝你，Sergey"}, {"zh-tw": " So one of the things -- both Sergey and I went to a Montessori school, and I think, for some reason, this has been incorporated in Google. And Sergey mentioned Orkut, which is something that, you know, Orkut wanted to do in his time, and we call this -- at Google, we've embodied this as \"the 20 percent time,\" and the idea is, for 20 percent of your time, if you're working at Google, you can do what you think is the best thing to do.", "en": " 有一件事--Sergey和我 都去過一所蒙特梭利學校 而我認為，基於某些原因 這已經被納入了Google 剛剛Sergey 提到了Orkut， 你知道的，Orkut當時想要做一件事 在Google我們將它體現為「百分之二十自由時間」 這個概念就是，如果你在Google工作 你會有百分之二十的時間你可以做你想做的事"}, {"zh-tw": " And many, many things at Google have come out of that, such as Orkut and also Google News. And I think many other things in the world also have come out of this.", "en": " 有好多好多Google的服務就是這樣來的 像是Orkut和Google新聞 我認為世界上很多其他事情也是這樣來的"}, {"zh-tw": " Mendel, who was supposed to be teaching high-school students, actually, you know, discovered the laws of genetics -- as a hobby, basically. So many, many useful things come out of this.", "en": " 孟德爾本來是要當高中老師的 而事實上，你知道的，他發現了遺傳學定律 基本上是基於興趣 非常多有用的事情來自於此"}, {"zh-tw": " And News, which I just mentioned, was started by a researcher. And he just -- he -- after 9/11, he got really interested in the news.", "en": " 還有我剛剛提到的Google新聞 是由一個研究者創立的 而他只是，在911事件後，對於新聞非常有興趣"}, {"zh-tw": " And he said, \"Why don't I look at the news better?\" And so he started clustering it by category, and then he started using it, and then his friends started using it. And then, besides just looking cute on a baby's bottom, we made it a Googlette, which is basically a small project at Google.", "en": " 然後他說：「我何不讓新聞更好看呢？」 所以他按照類型把新聞集中起來 然後他開始使用、他的朋友們也開始使用 然後，在看著嬰兒可愛的小屁屁之外 我們讓它成為Google小嬰兒（Google的產品） 基本上是一個小小的計畫"}, {"zh-tw": " So it'd be like three people, or something like that, and they would try to make a product. And we wouldn't really be sure if it's going to work or not.", "en": " 那就像是大概三個人之類的 試著做出一樣產品 我們不太確定那項產品究竟可行或不可行"}, {"zh-tw": " And in News' case, you know, they had a couple of people working on it for a while, and then more and more people started using it, and then we put it out on the Internet, and more and more people started using it. And now it's a real, full-blown project with more people on it.", "en": " 在Google新聞的例子裡，有幾個人在做這件事 然後越來越多人開始使用 然後我們將它發表在網路上 然後又有越來越多人開始使用這項服務 現在它已經是個有著更多人使用的真實的且完善的計畫"}, {"zh-tw": " And this is how we keep our innovation running. I think usually, as companies get bigger, they find it really hard to have small, innovative projects.", "en": " 這就是我們讓創新不段運轉的方法 我認為，當公司變得越大 他們就會發現要發展小規模的、創新的計畫越不容易"}, {"zh-tw": " And we had this problem, too, for a while, and we said, \"Oh, we really need a new concept.\" You know, the Googlettes -- that's a small project that we're not quite sure if it's going to work or not, but we hope it will, and if we do enough of them, some of them will really work and turn out, such as News. But then we had a problem because then we had over 100 projects.", "en": " 我們有一段時間也有這個問題，後來我們說： 「喔！我們真的需要一個新的概念。」 你知道的，Google小嬰兒—也就是我們不知道是否可行的小計畫 但我們希望，若我們為它們做得夠多的話， 它們中的一些可以開花結果，就像是Google新聞 但有一個問題是，我們因為這樣有了超過一百個計畫"}, {"zh-tw": " And I don't know about all of you, but I have trouble keeping 100 things in my head at once. And we found that if we just wrote all of them down and ordered them -- and these are kind of made up.", "en": " 我無法認識你們全部人 因為我要努力讓這一百件事同時在我腦袋裡運轉 然後我們發現如果我們把它們都寫下來 然後整理它們—這聽起來有點像是在胡說"}, {"zh-tw": " Don't really pay attention to them. For example, the \"Buy Iceland\" was from a media article.", "en": " 不要在上面花心思 比如說：「買冰島」是來自於媒體的一篇文章"}, {"zh-tw": " We would never do such a crazy thing, but -- in any case, we found if we just basically wrote them all down and ordered them, that most people would actually agree what the ordering should be. And this was kind of a surprise to me, but we found that as long as you keep the 100 things in your head, which you did by writing them down, that you could do a pretty good job deciding what to do and where to put your resources.", "en": " 我們絕對不會做這麼瘋狂的事，但 無論如何，我們發現如果我們只是寫下它們然後整理排序 大部分的人都會同意應該要將點子整理排序 這對我來說有些驚訝 我們發現一旦你藉由把它們寫下來 來將一百件事情同時放在腦子裡運轉 則你會非常正確的決定出你要做什麼 以及要將資源如何分配"}, {"zh-tw": " And so that's basically what we've done since we instituted that a few years ago, and I think it has really allowed us to be innovative and still stay reasonably well-organized. The other thing we discovered is that people like to work on things that are important, and so naturally, people sort of migrate to the things that are high priorities.", "en": " 以上基本上就是我們所做的 自從我們在幾年前制定了這套規矩，我認為它大大幫助了我們創新 並同時維持著良好組織化的 我們另一個發現就是人們喜歡在重要的事情上努力 自然而然 人們多少會將心思移到優先事項上"}, {"zh-tw": " I just wanted to highlight a couple of things that are new, or you might not know about. And the top thing, actually, is the Deskbar.", "en": " 我想強調幾件新的 或是你可能還不知道的事情 其中最首要的，就是桌面捷徑列(Deskbar)"}, {"zh-tw": " So this is a new -- how many of you use the Google Toolbar? Raise your hands. How many of you use the Deskbar? All right, see? You guys should try it out.", "en": " 這是新的—你們有幾個人使用Google工具列？ 請舉手 你們有多少人使用桌面捷徑列？ 好的，看，你們應該要試一試"}, {"zh-tw": " But if you go to our site and search for \"Deskbar,\" you'll get this. And the idea is, instead of a toolbar, it's just present all the time on your screen on the bottom, and you can do searches really easily.", "en": " 但如果你們上我們的網站 搜尋「桌面捷徑列」，你會得到這個 這個概念就是，不同於「工具列」 它會一直出現在你的螢幕下方 你可以很輕易的進行搜尋"}, {"zh-tw": " And it's sort of like a better version of the toolbar. Thank you, Sergey.", "en": " 那有點像是「工具列」的改良版 謝謝你，Sergey"}, {"zh-tw": " This is another example of a project that somebody at Google was really passionate about, and they just, they got going, and it's really, really a great product, and really taking off. Google Answers is something we started, which is really cool, which lets you -- for five to 100 dollars, you can type a question in, and then there's a pool of researchers that go out and research it for you, and it's guaranteed and all that, and you can get actually very good answers to things without spending all that time yourself.", "en": " 這是另一個例子 而他們剛開始研發 這真的真的是一個非常棒的產品，而且確實開始著手執行 Google Answers是一項我們已經開始的項目，這真的非常的酷 這讓你能花5到100美元 輸入一個你想問的問題 接著將有一大群的研究人員 為你研究這個問題，且有品質保證 你可以不用花費自己太多的時間 就得到很好的答案"}, {"zh-tw": " Froogle lets you search shopping information, and Blogger lets you publish things. But all of these -- well, these were all sort of innovative things that we did that -- you know, we try many, many different things in our company.", "en": " Froogle幫助你找尋購物資訊 然後Blogger部落格讓你發表東西 經由這些許多種類的創新產品 你們可以得知我們公司 嘗試了許許多多不同的產品"}, {"zh-tw": " We also like to innovate in our physical space, and we noticed in meetings, you know, you have to wait a long time for projectors to turn on and off, and they're noisy, so people shut them off. And we didn't like that, so we actually, in maybe a couple of weeks, we built these little enclosures that enclosed the projectors, and so we can leave them on all the time and they're completely silent.", "en": " 我們也喜歡在我們的物理空間上做革新 我們也注意到在開會時，你知道的，你必須等很長的時間 去等待投影機開關 而且它們的噪音很大，所以人們總會把它關掉 而我們不喜歡這樣，所以事實上 我們花了大約兩週，製作了這個小容器 可以放置投影機，因此我們可以使投影機隨時開著 而且完全安靜"}, {"zh-tw": " And as a result, we were able to build some software that also lets us manage a meeting, so when you walk into a meeting room now, it lists all the meetings that are happening, you can very easily take notes, and they just get emailed automatically to all the people that were present in the meeting. And as we become more of a global company, we find these things really affect us -- you know, can we work effectively with people who aren't in the room? And things like that. And simple things like this can really make a big difference.", "en": " 結果，我們也得以製作一些軟體 也可以讓我們進行會議管理 所以現在當你走進會議室 這個軟體會列舉所有正在進行的會議 你會非常容易的作紀錄，而且它還會自動發出電子郵件 給所有出席會議的人 隨著我們成為更加全球化的公司 我們發現這真的對我們很有影響 你知道，我們能有效率的和不在會議室中的人一起工作 諸如此類，而這簡單的事情卻能造成很大的改變"}, {"zh-tw": " We also have a lot of engineers in those meetings, and they don't always do their laundry as much as they should. And so we found it was pretty helpful to have laundry machines, for our younger employees especially, and ...", "en": " 我們也有很多的工程師在這些會議中 雖然他們應該常洗衣服，但他們總是做不到 所以我們發現提供洗衣機對他們很有幫助 特別是那些年輕的工程師"}, {"zh-tw": " we also allow dogs and things like that, and we've had, I think, a really fun culture at our company, which helps people work and enjoy what they're doing. This is actually our \"cult picture.\" I just wanted to show quickly.", "en": " 我們也允許帶狗上班或這一類的事 我們擁有，就我認為，非常有趣的公司文化 這讓員工能享受於他們的工作 這是我們的 \"異教照片\" 我只想快速的讓你們看一下"}, {"zh-tw": " We had this on our website for a while, but we found that after we put it on our website, we didn't get any job applications anymore. But anyway, every year we've taken the whole company on a ski trip.", "en": " 我們讓這張照片在我們的網站上放了一陣子 而我們發現在我們放上照片後 就沒有任何人來應徵了 但無論如何，我們每年都會 帶全公司的人去滑雪之旅"}, {"zh-tw": " A lot of work happens in companies from people knowing each other, and informally. And I think we've done a good job encouraging that.", "en": " 很多公司的作品都在員工輕鬆的互相交流之中產生 我認為我們有效的鼓勵了其發生"}, {"zh-tw": " It makes it a really fun place to work. Along with our logos, too, which I think really embody our culture when we change things.", "en": " 這使得工作場所變得更有趣 還有我們的商標，我認為在我們改變商標的時 體現出了我們的文化"}, {"zh-tw": " In the early days, we were actually advised we should never change our logo because we should establish our brand, you know, because, you know, you'd never want to change your logo. You want it to be consistent.", "en": " 在早期我們就被建議過 絕對不要更改我們的商標 因為我們必須建立自己的品牌，你知道的， 因為，你知道的，你永遠也不會想要更改自己的商標 你會希望它始終如一的"}, {"zh-tw": " And we said, \"Well, that doesn't sound so much fun. Why don't we try changing it every day?\" One of the things that really excites me about what we're doing now is we have this thing called AdSense, and this is a little bit foreshadowing -- this is from before Dean dropped out.", "en": " 然後我們說：「嗯...那聽起來不太有趣。」 我們何不試著每天換商標呢？ 關於我們現在所做的事情有一件讓我特別感到興奮的事 就是我們有一個叫做AdSense的產品 這是一個小開端 開始於Howard Dean退選以前"}, {"zh-tw": " But the idea is, like, on a newspaper, for example, we show you relevant ads. And this is hard to read, but this says \"Battle for New Hampshire: Howard Dean for President\" -- articles on Howard Dean.", "en": " 而這個主意就像是，例如在報紙上 我們會給你展示相關廣告 而這很難閱讀，但是有關 \"新漢普郡之戰： Howard Dean競選總統\" —Howard Dean的相關文章"}, {"zh-tw": " And these ads are generated automatically -- like in this case, on the Washington Post -- from the content on the site. And so we use our over 150,000 advertisers and millions of advertisements, so we pick the one that's most relevant to what you're actually looking at, much as we do on search.", "en": " 這些廣告幾乎都是自動生成的 像這個例子，在華盛頓郵報 它是來自網站內容 因此我們利用超過150000位廣告客戶 和幾百萬則廣告中，選出一則 與你所看到的內容中最相關的一則 我們會儘量搜尋"}, {"zh-tw": " So the idea is we can make advertising useful, not just annoying, right? And the nice thing about this, we have a self-serve program, and many thousands of websites have signed up, and this let's them really make money. And I -- you know, there's a number of people I met -- I met this guy who runs a conservation site at a party, and he said, \"You know, I wasn't making any money. I just put this thing on my site and I'm making 10,000 dollars a month.", "en": " 這個概念就是我們要讓廣告有用 不只是惱人，對吧？ 關於這個有一件很不錯的事 我們有一套自助計畫 有數千到數萬個網站註冊了 並且這讓他們賺大錢 我遇過到很多人 我在一個派對上遇到了這個經營一個保育網站的傢伙 他說：「你知道嗎，我以前沒有賺到任何錢。」 「我只是把這些東西放到我的網站上，結果現在我每個月就有一萬元入袋」"}, {"zh-tw": " And, you know, thank you. I don't have to do my other job now.\" And I think this is really important for us, because it makes the Internet work better.", "en": " 「感謝你」 「我現在不需要再做我另一份工作了」 我認為這對我們而言很重要，因為這讓網際網路變得更好"}, {"zh-tw": " It makes content get better, it makes searching work better, when people can really make their livelihood from producing great content. So this session is supposed to be about the future, so I'd thought I'd talk at least briefly about it.", "en": " 這讓網路上的內容變得更好，也讓搜尋運作更順利 人們能夠從提供好的內容中 獲得溫飽 這個部份是關於未來的 所以我覺得我至少應該簡短談一下"}, {"zh-tw": " And the idea behind this is to do the perfect job doing search, you really have to be smart. Because you can type, you know, any kind of thing into Google, and you expect an answer back, right? But finding things is tricky, and so you really want intelligence.", "en": " 這背後的想法是：要做出完美的搜尋 你必須要很聰明 因為你可以在Google上鍵入任何類型的東西 你就可以得到結果，對吧？ 但要找東西是很棘手的，所以你很想要有智慧"}, {"zh-tw": " And in fact, the ultimate search engine would be smart. It would be artificial intelligence.", "en": " 而事實上，終極搜尋引擎是很聰明的 它將會成為人工智慧"}, {"zh-tw": " And so that's something we work on, and we even have some people who are excited enough and crazy enough to work on it now, and that's really their goal. So we always hope that Google will be smart, but we're always surprised when other people think that it is.", "en": " 那就是我們正在努力的事 我們現在甚至有著一群夠興奮也夠瘋狂的人 來做這件事 這也是他們的目標 我們總是希望Google能夠很聰明 但在別人這麼認為時，我們也總是很驚訝"}, {"zh-tw": " And so I just wanted to give a funny example of this.

You can't see it that well, but we decided we should put in this feature into our AdSense ads, called \"related searches.\" And so we'd say, you know, \"Did you mean 'search for'\" -- what is this, in this case, \"Saddam Hussein,\" because this blog is about Iraq -- and you know, in addition to the ads, and we thought this would be a great idea. And so there is this blog of a young person who was kind of depressed, and he said, \"You know, I'm sleeping a lot.\" He was just kind of writing about his life.", "en": " 「相關搜尋」在那兒，你可能看不太清楚 但我們決定要在我們的AdSense放上這個功能 叫做「相關搜尋」 所以我們會說：「你是不是要找......」 在這個例子中，會出現「海珊」因為這個部落格和伊拉克有關 在廣告之外 我們認為這會是一個好主意 這裡有一個部落格 是屬於一個有點沮喪的年輕人的，他說： 「你知道的，我睡很多」 他只是寫下他的生活點滴"}, {"zh-tw": " And our algorithms -- not a person, of course, but our algorithms, our computers -- read his blog and decided that the related search was, \"I am bored.\" And he read this, and he thought a person had decided that he was boring, and it was very unfortunate, and he said, \"You know, what are these, you know, bastards at Google doing? Why don't they like my blog?\" And so then we read his blog, which was getting -- you know, sort of going from bad to worse, and we said the related search was, \"Retards.\" And then, you know, he got even more mad, and he wrote -- like, started swearing and so on. And then we produced \"You suck.\" And finally, it ended with \"Kiss my ass.\" And so basically, he thought he was dealing with something smart, and of course, you know, we just sort of wrote this program and we tried it out, and it didn't quite work, and we don't have this feature anymore.", "en": " 而我們的演算法—當然不是一個真人 我們的演算法，我們的電腦， 讀到了他的部落格並決定將它 列為「我很無聊」的相關搜尋 然後他看到了，他以為是一個人決定了 他很無聊這樣的評語 這很不幸， 然後他說：「這些Google的混帳在做什麼？ 他們為什麼不喜歡我的部落格？」 所以後來我們去看了他的部落格， 事情變得越來越糟， 我們的相關搜尋顯示「發育遲緩」 後來，你知道的，他更生氣了 他寫了一些像是咒罵等等的 然後我們產生出「你這爛人」 最後結果是以「你去吃屎吧！」作終 基本上，他以為他是在跟有智慧的對象打交道 但當然的， 我們只是寫下了這個程式並且試試看 但不太好用 後來我們就不再使用這個功能了"}, {"zh-tw": " So with that, maybe I can switch back to the world. I wanted to end just by saying that there's a couple things that really make me excited to be involved with Google, and one of those is that we're able to make money largely through advertising, and one of the benefits that I didn't expect from that was that we're able to serve everyone in the world without worrying about, you know, places that don't have as much money.", "en": " 或許我可以切換回到這個世界圖 我想以談談這個來做結 有幾件事讓我對於 身處Google之中感到興奮 其中之一就是我們可以藉由廣告來賺錢 其中一個我不曾預期到的好處是 我們可以服務世界上每一個人 而不用擔心有些地方沒有那麼多錢"}, {"zh-tw": " So we don't have to worry about our products being sold, for example, for less money in places that are poor, and then they get re-imported into the U.S. -- for example, with the drug industry.
