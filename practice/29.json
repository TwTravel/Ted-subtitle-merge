But I think, more realistically,that being in a gang -- selling drugs for a gang -- is perhapsthe worst job in all of America.", "en": " 但我今天要告訴各位，事實上，根據十年的研究 在一次深入幫派的難得機會中 親眼見到幫派的帳冊，看到他們的財務紀錄後 我們發現，幫派生活一點都不光鮮亮麗 更實際一點，我認為當個幫派弟兄 為幫派販毒，可能是全美國最糟糕的工作"}, {"zh-tw": " And that's what I'd liketo convince you of today. So there are three things I want to do.", "en": " 這就是我今天想要說服各位的 因此我要做三件事情"}, {"zh-tw": " First, I want to explainhow and why crack cocaine had such a profound influenceon inner-city gangs.

To do that, you have to actually goback to a time before crack cocaine, in the early '80s, and look at itfrom the perspective of a gang leader.", "en": " 首先來談談快克古柯鹼，以及它如何改變了幫派生態 但我們得先回顧快克古柯鹼盛行以前的情形 回到80年代初期，以幫派老大的角度來思考"}, {"zh-tw": " Being a gang leader in the inner citywasn't such a bad deal in the mid-'80s -- the early '80s, let me say.

It had a huge impact on life.", "en": " 但是我指的是負面影響，沒有提升，反而降低了福祉 它對生活影響甚鉅"}, {"zh-tw": " So what was it about crack cocaine? It was a brilliant wayof getting the brain high.

The first building?Well, there's nobody there.", "en": " 來自郊區的蘇西耶，壓根兒沒去過貧民區 仍盡責地帶著寫字夾板，走到國宅區 來到第一棟樓前 情形如何？嗯，没半個人影"}, {"zh-tw": " But he hears some voicesup in the stairwell, so he climbs up the stairwell,comes around the corner, and finds a group of youngAfrican-American men playing dice. This is about 1990,peak of the crack epidemic.", "en": " 但他聽到樓梯間傳來聲響，於是爬上樓梯 走到轉角處 看見一群年輕黑人在玩骰子 這是1990年的事了，正逢快克古柯鹼高峰期"}, {"zh-tw": " This is a very dangerous job,being in a gang. You don't like to be surprised.", "en": " 為幫派做事非常危險，因此你不喜歡出其不意"}, {"zh-tw": " You don't like to be surprisedby people who come around the corner. And the mantra was:shoot first; ask questions later.", "en": " 不喜歡有人出其不意出現在轉角處 你的座右銘是：先開槍再說"}, {"zh-tw": " Now, Sudhir was lucky --he was such a freak, and that clipboardprobably saved his life, because they figured no otherrival gang member would be coming up to shootat them with a clipboard. So his greeting was not particularlywarm, but they did say, well, OK -- let's hearyour questions on your survey.", "en": " 但蘇西耶很走運 他像個書呆子 手上的夾板可能救了他一條小命，因為幫派弟兄想 沒有仇家會拿個寫字板來槍殺我們 所以即便他沒有受到熱烈歡迎，對方倒說 嗯，好吧，把你的問題說來聽聽"}, {"zh-tw": " So -- I kid you not -- the first question on the surveythat he was sent to ask was: \"How do you feel about beingpoor and Black in America?\" Makes you wonder about academics. So the choice of answers were: [A) Very Good B) Good C) Bad D) Very Bad] What Sudhir found out is, in fact,that the real answer was the following: [A) Very Good B) Good C) BadD) Very Bad E) Fuck you] The survey was not, in the end, goingto be what got Sudhir off the hook.", "en": " 我没跟各位說笑，他手上的問卷上第一道題目是： 「在美國當個窮黑人的感覺如何？」 真想不透學術界的人腦袋裡裝什麼，對不對？ 題目的選項為: 1.非常好 2.好 3.不好 4.非常不好 蘇西耶發現，實際受訪者回答如下： (5. 幹！) 但這個問卷並沒有讓蘇西耶就此脫身"}, {"zh-tw": " He was held hostageovernight in the stairwell. There was a lot of gunfire, there were a lot of philosophicaldiscussions he had with the gang members.", "en": " 他被押做人質，整晚關在樓梯間 晚上槍聲四起 他和弟兄也聊了許多哲學議題"}, {"zh-tw": " By morning, the gang leader arrived, checked out Sudhir,decided he was no threat, and they let him go home. So Sudhir went home,took a shower, took a nap.", "en": " 次日早上，幫派老大來了 打量了蘇西耶一番 認定他不具威脅性，決定讓他回家 所以蘇西耶回到家，沖了澡，睡一覺"}, {"zh-tw": " And you and I, probably, facedwith the situation, would think, \"I guess I'm going to writemy dissertation on The Grateful Dead, I've been following themfor the last three months.\" Sudhir, on the other hand, got right back, walkeddown to the housing project, went up to the second floor, and said: \"Hey, guys, I had so much funhanging out with you last night, I wonder if I could do it again tonight.\" And that was the beginning of what turnedout to be a beautiful relationship that involved Sudhir living in the housingproject on and off for 10 years, hanging out in crack houses,going to jail with the gang members, having the windows shot out of his car, having the police break into his apartmentand steal his computer disks -- you name it. But ultimately, the storyhas a happy ending for Sudhir, who became one of the mostrespected sociologists in the country.", "en": " 換做你我，在這種情況下可能會決定 嗯，我想我的博士論文還是寫「死之華」好了 畢竟我已經研究他們三個月了 但蘇西耶很快就又回去了--他再度來到國宅前 爬上階梯，走到二樓說：「嘿，大夥兒」 「我昨晚跟大家玩得挺愉快的」 「今天晚上還可以跟你們玩嗎」 這是一段動人情誼的開端 蘇西耶前後在國宅內住了十年 期間出入古柯鹼交易場所、和幫派弟兄蹲過苦牢 車窗被槍射得滿天飛 警察闖進家門沒收電腦硬碟 什麼衰事都遇過 但蘇西耶的故事有個美滿的結局 他成了美國最受敬重的社會學家之一"}, {"zh-tw": " And especially for me, as I sat in my officewith my Excel spreadsheet open, waiting for Sudhir to come and deliverto me the latest load of data that he would get from the gang. It was one of the most unequalco-authoring relationships ever -- But I was glad to bethe beneficiary of it.", "en": " 我更是享盡好處，只要坐在辦公室裡開著Excel的表格 等著蘇西耶跟我報到，乖乖奉上最新的... 幫派資料 那真是最不平等的共同作者關係之一 但我很慶幸我是獲益的一方"}, {"zh-tw": " So what did we find? What did we find in the gang? Well, let me say one thing: We really got accessto everybody in the gang. We got an inside look at the gang,from the very bottom up to the very top.", "en": " 我們有什麼發現？從幫派身上知道什麼？讓我說件事 我們真的接觸了幫派裡的每個成員 得以從上到下裡裡外外一探幫派究竟"}, {"zh-tw": " They trusted Sudhir, in waysthat really no academic has ever -- or really anybody, any outsider --has ever earned the trust of these gangs, to the point where they actually opened up what was most interestingfor me -- their books, the financial records they kept. They made them available to us,and we not only could study them, but we could ask them questionsabout what was in them.", "en": " 他們信賴蘇西耶，學術界從沒有其他人辦到過 任何人、任何圈外人，從未有人贏得過這些幫派這等信賴 他們甚至對他開誠佈公，公開我認為最有趣的東西： 幫派的帳冊，他們的財務紀錄 也讓我們有機會過目 我們不但能夠研究帳冊，還能提問"}, {"zh-tw": " So if I have to kind of summarizevery quickly in the short time I have what the bottom line of whatI take away from the gang is, it's that, if I had to drawa parallel between the gang and any other organization, it would be that the gangis just like McDonald's, in a lot of different respects --the restaurant McDonald's. So first, in one way, which isn't maybe the most interestingway, but it's a good way to start -- is in the way it's organized,the hierarchy of the gang, the way it looks.", "en": " 因此，如果要我扼要說明 我從這個幫派身上學到的要點 就是，如果將幫派比擬為任何組織 那會是麥當勞 在很多方面，幫派與麥當勞餐廳有相似之處 首先，這也許不是最有趣的面向 但很適合做開頭--兩者的組織方式類似 幫派的階層制度形似麥當勞"}, {"zh-tw": " So here's what the org chartof the gang looks like. I don't know if you know muchabout org charts, but if you were to assign a stripped-downand simplified McDonald's org chart, this is exactly what it would look like.", "en": " 這是幫派的組織架構圖 不知道是否有人熟悉組織架構圖 但如果你要畫一個簡單版的麥當勞企業組織架構圖 就長得像這樣"}, {"zh-tw": " It's amazing, but the toplevel of the gang, they actually call themselvesthe \"Board of Directors.\" And Sudhir says it's not like these guyshad a very sophisticated view of what happenedin American corporate life, but they had seen movieslike \"Wall Street,\" and they had learned a little bitabout what it was like to be in the real world. Now, below that board of directors, you've got essentiallywhat are regional VPs -- people who control, say, the South Sideof Chicago, or the West Side of Chicago.", "en": " 這相當驚人，但幫派的高層 還真的自稱為「董事會」 蘇西耶說，這不是說這些人很懂 美國企業運作模式云云 但他們看過《華爾街》這類的電影 對於現實社會的運作方式略知一二 而在董事會下面，有地區副總裁 比如說，負責芝加哥南部的、或管西部的副總裁"}, {"zh-tw": " Sudhir got to know very well the guywho had the unfortunate assignment of trying to take the Iowa franchise, which, it turned out, for this black gang, was not one of the more brilliantfinancial endeavors they undertook. But the thing that really makes the gangseem like McDonald's is its franchisees.", "en": " 蘇西耶甚至熟識一個可憐的傢伙 被分到負責愛荷華的分支 結果發現，這支黑人幫派在愛荷華 實在賺不到什麼錢 但幫派近似麥當勞之處，正是各地的加盟處"}, {"zh-tw": " The guys who are runningthe local gangs -- the four-square-blockby four-square-block areas -- they're just like the guys, in some sense,who are running the McDonald's. They are the entrepreneurs.", "en": " 這些人負責經營地區幫派 也就是長寬各四個街區大小的地盤 他們就像經營麥當勞的人 都是企業家"}, {"zh-tw": " They get the exclusive property rightsto control the drug-selling. They get the name of the gang behind them,for merchandising and marketing.", "en": " 擁有專屬產權，可以控制毒品交易 打著幫派的名號，方便推銷和行銷"}, {"zh-tw": " And they're the ones who basicallymake the profit or lose a profit, depending on how goodthey are at running the business. Now, the group I really want youto think about, though, are the ones at the bottom --the foot soldiers.", "en": " 而幫派的盈虧，基本上都看他們的表現 端看事業經營狀況好壞 但我希望各位思考的，是這些位於階層最底端的 小囉嘍"}, {"zh-tw": " These are the teenagers, typically, who'd be standing out on the streetcorner, selling the drugs. Extremely dangerous work.", "en": " 這些小囉嘍基本上都是青少年 站在街角賣毒品 這是極其危險的工作"}, {"zh-tw": " And important to note is that almost allof the weight, all of the people in this organization are at the bottom --just like McDonald's. So in some sense, the foot soldiersare a lot like the people who are taking your order at McDonald's, and it's not just by chancethat they're like them.", "en": " 要注意的是，幫派幾乎所有重心、所有人 都屬於組織最底層 對，就像麥當勞一樣 所以就某方面而言，幫派裡的小囉嘍就像 在麥當勞負責幫你點餐的店員 當然，這並非偶然"}, {"zh-tw": " In fact, in these neighborhoods,they'd be the same people. So the same kids who are workingin the gang were actually, at the very same time,typically working part-time at a place like McDonald's.", "en": " 事實上，在這些社區裡，他們可能正是同一批人 在幫派裡當小囉嘍的孩子其實 同一時間也在兼差 也在麥當勞這種地方打工"}, {"zh-tw": " Which already foreshadowsthe main result that I've talked about, about what a crappy jobit was, being in the gang. Because obviously, if being in the gangwere such a wonderful, lucrative job, why in the world would these guysmoonlight at McDonald's? So what do the wages look like?You might be surprised.", "en": " 這呼應了我先前所說的 混幫派實在是超爛的工作 因為，如果混幫派那麼美好、這麼好賺 這些人幹嘛吃飽沒事去麥當勞兼差？ 他們薪水多少？各位可能會嚇一跳"}, {"zh-tw": " But based on being able to talk to themand to see their records, this is what it lookslike in terms of the wages. The hourly wage the foot soldierswere earning was $3.50 an hour.", "en": " 根據實際上的 訪談和帳冊紀錄 他們領的薪水大概這樣 這些小囉嘍的時薪是三塊半美元"}, {"zh-tw": " It was below the minimum wage.And this is well-documented. It's easy to see by the patternsof consumption they have.", "en": " 低於基本薪資，對吧？這都是有根據的 這些數據從他們的支出紀錄很容易得出"}, {"zh-tw": " It really is not fiction -- it's fact. There was very little money in the gang,especially at the bottom.", "en": " 這不是瞎掰，是切確的事實 幫派賺不了多少錢，尤其最底層的小囉嘍"}, {"zh-tw": " Now if you managed to rise up, say,and be that local leader, the guy who's the equivalentof the McDonald's franchisee, you'd be making 100,000 dollars a year.

Truly, you would be a great success story.", "en": " 若你得以升到最高層 每年大概可以賺二十到四十萬美金 沒錯，你得以功成名就"}, {"zh-tw": " And one of the sad partsof this is that, indeed, among the many otherramifications of crack cocaine is that the most talented individualsin these communities -- this is what they were striving for. They weren't trying to make itin legitimate ways, because there wereno legitimate channels out.", "en": " 而快克古柯鹼造成的悲劇之一，除了其他數不盡的後果以外 就是，貧民區裡最有才華的孩子 只懷有這樣的夢想 他們追尋成功的方法並不合法 因為根本就沒有合法的途徑"}, {"zh-tw": " This was the best way out.

The money looks about the same.", "en": " 看看這個 我們頗析幫派與麥當勞的關連 各階層的薪水看起來差不多"}, {"zh-tw": " Why is it such a bad job? Well, the reason it's such a bad jobis that there's somebody shooting at you a lot of the time. So, with shooting at you,what are the death rates? We found, in our gang -- and admittedly, this was not reallya standard situation; this was a time of intense violence,of a lot of gang wars, as this gang actuallybecame quite successful.", "en": " 為什麼這是個爛工作？ 嗯，這工作之所以爛，是因為有人 常常會對你開槍 那，這種槍擊事件的死亡率是多少 我們所研究的這個幫派，當然這不能 適用於所有幫派的情況 當時暴力事件頻仍，有許多幫派械鬥 這支幫派後來勢力壯大，但也付出了代價"}, {"zh-tw": " But there were costs. And so the death rate -- not to mention the rate of being arrested,sent to prison, being wounded -- the death rate in our samplewas seven percent per person per year.", "en": " 因此死亡率--先不算被逮補的機率 也不算坐牢、受傷率，光是如此，樣本裡的死亡率 就高達每年每人百分之七"}, {"zh-tw": " You're in the gang for four years, you expect to diewith about a 25 percent likelihood.

So it's a lot safer being on death row than it is selling drugsout on the street.", "en": " 結果，死刑犯監獄的死亡率 列入所有死因，包括處決，是一年百分之二 所以當個死刑犯比在街頭販毒還要安全"}, {"zh-tw": " That gives you some pause,for those of you who believe that a death penalty's going to havean enormous deterrent effect on crime. To give you a sense of just how badthe inner city was during crack -- and I'm not really focusingon the negatives, but really, there's another storyto tell you there -- if you look at the death ratesjust of random, young black males growing up in the inner cityin the United States, the death rates during crackwere about one percent.", "en": " 這讓人不禁思考，讓各位重新思考 死刑對犯罪真的有極大的嚇阻作用嗎 讓各位了解快克古柯鹼盛行時，貧民區的情況多糟糕 我沒有刻意只報憂不報喜 但這邊另一個故事要跟各位分享 看看死亡率 任何一個在美國貧民區成長的年輕黑人男性 在快克古柯鹼盛行時，死亡率大約是百分之一"}, {"zh-tw": " That's extremely high.

I think the first oneis that they got fooled by history.", "en": " 你可能會問，天底下有誰會願意 在街角販毒，只為了賺那微薄的時薪三塊半？ 而且在未來四年內，死亡率還高達百分之二十五？ 他們為什麼要這麼做？我認為有幾個答案 第一，他們被過去的歷史騙了"}, {"zh-tw": " It used to be the gangwas a rite of passage; that the young people controlled the gang; that as you got older,you dropped out of the gang.
