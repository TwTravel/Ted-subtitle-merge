And the question was: What do we have to do to make surethat our company lasts 100 years?

Where better to turnfor advice than nature, that's been in the businessof life and death for longer than any company? As a lapsed biologist, I decided to immediately calla real biologist, my friend Simon Levin, Professor of Biology and Mathematicsat Princeton University.", "en": " 讓我們回到科技總裁的問題。 哪裏有向比大自然學習更好的方法呢？ 大自然已經在生死輪回的遊戲中 比任何公司存活得還要久。 身為一位外行的生物學家， 我決定馬上去請教真正內行的生物學家， 我的朋友賽門萊文， 普林斯頓大學的生物數學教授。"}, {"zh-tw": " Together, we looked at a varietyof biological systems, ranging from natural tropical rainforests through to managed forests and fisheries. And we asked ourselves the question: What makes these systemsresilient and enduring? And what we foundwas that the same six principles that we saw underpinningthe miracle of the human immune system actually cropped up again and again, from redundancy through to embeddedness.", "en": " 我們共同研究了許多生態系統， 範圍從天然熱帶雨林 到人造森林和漁業。 我們問自己一個問題： 是什麼使這些系統具有抗壓能力和持續性的？ 我們發現恰恰是支撐人體免疫系統的 六條規律。 從冗餘設計到鑲嵌性一次又一次的出現。"}, {"zh-tw": " In fact, we saw these principlesnot only in biologically enduring systems, we also found thembeing very characteristic of long-lived social systems, like the Roman Empireand the Catholic Church, believe it or not. We also went on to look at business, and found that these very same propertiesalso characterized businesses that were resilient and long-lived, and we noted their absencefrom ones which were short-lived.", "en": " 實際上，我們發現到，這些準則不僅出現在生物永續系統中， 它們在壽命長久的社會系統中 也表現得十分突出， 例如羅馬帝國及天主教教堂， 信不信由你。 我們還深入研究企業， 也發現它們在堅韌且長久的企業中 也表現的非常明顯。 我們也注意到，缺乏這些要素的企業，通常也比較短命。"}, {"zh-tw": " Let's first take a look at what happenswhen the corporate immune system collapses. This beautiful building is partof the Shitennoji Temple Complex in Osaka, Japan.", "en": " 我們先來看看， 當企業的免疫機制失效時會發生什麼。 這一棟漂亮的建築物 是日本大阪天王寺院的其中一部分。"}, {"zh-tw": " In fact, it's one of the oldesttemples in Japan.

Amazingly, his company, Kongō Gumi, was still around 1,428 years later.", "en": " 這位韓國工匠前往日本設立了寺廟建築公司。 令人驚訝的是，他的公司 Kongō Gumi， 1480年後，依然存在。"}, {"zh-tw": " In fact, it became the oldestcontinuously operating company in the world. So how is Kongō Gumi doing today? Not too well, I'm afraid.", "en": " 實際上，它是世界上 持續經營最久的老公司。 那 Kongō Gumi 目前的公司狀況如何呢？ 恐怕不太好。"}, {"zh-tw": " It borrowed very heavily during the bubble periodof the Japanese economy, to invest in real estate. And when the bubble burst,it couldn't refinance its loans.", "en": " 它在日本泡沫經濟時，貸款了很多錢投資在房地產上。 就在泡沫破滅後，公司已經無法再融資，"}, {"zh-tw": " The company failed, and it was taken overby a major construction company. Tragically, after 40 generationsof very careful stewardship by the Kongō family, Kongō Gumi succumbedto a spectacular lapse in the ability to applya principle of prudence.", "en": " 所以公司倒了， 最後被一家主流公司接手管理。 可悲的是，經過了 Kongō 家族 40世代的努力經營， 這家公司最後還是臣服於沒有採取 精準化經營而宣告停止營業。"}, {"zh-tw": " Speaking of company failures: we're all familiarwith the failure of Kodak, the company that declared bankruptcy in January 2012. Much more interesting,however, is the question: Why did Fujifilm -- same product, same pressuresfrom digital technology, same time -- why was Fujifilmable to survive and flourish? Fujifilm used its capabilitiesin chemistry, material science and optics to diversify into a number of areas, ranging from cosmetics to pharmaceuticals, to medical systems to biomaterials.", "en": " 談到公司倒閉： 大家對柯達應該都耳熟能詳， 這家公司在 2012年一月宣布破產。 然而，還有一個更有趣的問題： 為什麼富士軟片 ——同樣的產品、數位科技的壓力、同一時期—— 為什麼富士軟片得以生存下來並發光發熱？ 因為富士軟片懂得把它的化工能力、材料科學及光學技術 運用在不同領域， 從化妝品、藥品、 醫療系統到生物材料。"}, {"zh-tw": " Some of these diversificationattempts failed. But in aggregate, it was able to adaptits portfolio sufficiently to survive and flourish.", "en": " 有些多樣性的嘗試失敗了。 但總體而言， 它還是能採取有效的資產配置， 來維持企業的生存與發展。"}, {"zh-tw": " As the CEO, Mr. Komori, put it, the strategy succeededbecause it had \"more pockets and drawers\" than the rivals. He meant, of course, that they were able to createmore options than the rivals.", "en": " 就像其 CEO， Komori先生說的 他們策略成功的原因是 比對手有更多的＂口袋跟抽屜＂。 當然，他的意思是， 他們比對手有更多的選擇空間。"}, {"zh-tw": " Fujifilm survived because it appliedthe principles of prudence, diversity and adaptation. A catastrophic factory fire,like the one we see here, completely wiped out, in one evening, the only plant which supplied Toyotawith valves for car-braking systems.", "en": " 富士軟片能生存的原因是，它採用了精準、 多樣化、 適應能力的準則。 一場災難性的工廠大火，如我們現在所看到的， 就在一個晚上完全燒毀， 這是唯一一家提供 豐田汽車煞車系統閥門的工廠。"}, {"zh-tw": " The ultimate test of resilience. Car production groundto a screeching halt.", "en": " 這是一場對抗壓能力的終極考驗。 汽車產線完全被迫中止。"}, {"zh-tw": " How was it, then, that Toyotawas able to recover car production? Can you imagine how long it took? Just five days. From having no braking valvesto complete recovery in five days.", "en": " 但豐田汽車花了多久的時間回復產能？ 你們可以想像花了多久時間嗎？ 僅五天。 從沒有剎車閥門到產能完全恢復只花了五天的時間。"}, {"zh-tw": " How was this possible? Toyota managed its network of suppliersin such a collaborative manner that it could work very quicklyand smoothly with suppliers to repurpose production, fill the missing braking valve capacity and have car production come online again. Toyota applied the principlesof modularity of its supply network, embeddedness in an integrated system and the functional redundancyto be able to repurpose, smoothly, existing capacity.", "en": " 這怎麼辦到的？ 豐田快速整合了它的供應商網路， 以同舟共濟的態度，與供應商一起 快速流暢地重新規劃生產， 填補掉煞車閥門被迫停產的漏洞， 讓汽車的生產再度上線。 豐田汽車採用了「供給網絡模塊化」原理、 相互結合系統中的「鑲嵌」原理 以及有效的冗餘設計來達到順利重整現有產能的目標。"}, {"zh-tw": " Now fortunately, few companiessuccumb to catastrophic fires. But we do read in the newspaperevery day about companies succumbing to the disruptionof technology.", "en": " 很幸運的，如今僅有少數公司無法度過火災的難關。 但每天新聞還是看到不少公司 因顛覆性科技的破壞而瓦解。"}, {"zh-tw": " How is it, then, that the consumeroptics giant Essilor is able to avoid technology disruption,and even profit from it? And yes, technology disruptionis not only a big deal in software and electronics. Essilor carefully scansthe competitive environment for potentially disruptive technologies.", "en": " 然而消費性光學巨人，依視路公司 是如何避掉顛覆性科技的破壞甚至還能獲利呢？ 沒錯，顛覆性科技 不僅僅在軟體產業和電子產業上意義重大。 依視路仔細地在競爭環境中 審視潛在的顛覆性科技。"}, {"zh-tw": " It acquires those technologies very early, before they've become expensiveor competitors have mobilized around them, and it then developsthose technologies itself, even at the risk of failure or the risk of self-disruption. Essilor stays ahead of its game, and has delivered spectacular performance for over 40 years, by using the principlesof prudence and adaptation.", "en": " 並將這些技術變貴或競爭對手掌握之前，盡快地取得它們， 之後再發展該項技術， 即使有失敗的風險 或是研究中斷的風險。 依視路過去四十年來一直是同業中的佼佼者， 因為運用了精明和適應力準則所以業績表現一直都不錯。"}, {"zh-tw": " OK, if these principles are so powerful,you might be thinking, why are they not commonplace in business? Why do we not use these words every day? Well, change has to firststart in the mind. If we think back to our pitch to Bob, in order to apply the principles that underpin the miracleof the human immune system, we first need to think differently about business.", "en": " 好，如果這些準則這麼有效，你可能會問， 為什麼它們在企業裡並不是那麼地常見？ 為什麼我們不每天使用這些準則？ 沒錯，改變需要從你的頭腦開始。 如果我們回想一下對包柏做的投售報告， 為了運用支撐人體免疫機制的 幾條法則， 我們首先需要換個角度思考 企業的經營。"}, {"zh-tw": " Now typically, when we thinkabout business, we use what I call \"mechanical thinking.\" We set goals, we analyze problems, we construct and we adhere to plans, and more than anything else, we stress efficiencyand short-term performance. Now, don't get me wrong -- this is a splendidly practicaland effective way of addressing relatively simple challenges in relatively stable environments.", "en": " 基本上，當我們談論到企業經營， 我們都常會陷入一種我稱之為「機械式思考」的迷思。 我們設定目標後， 會分析問題， 擬定計畫並緊盯著計畫， 最重要的是 我們卻只著重在效率和短期表現 千萬別誤會—— 在相對穩定的環境中，對解決相對簡單的挑戰上，這是一個相當實用而且有效的方法，"}, {"zh-tw": " It's the way that Bob -- and probablymany of us, myself included -- process most business problemswe're faced with every day. In fact, it was a pretty goodmental model for business -- overall -- until about the mid-1980s, when the conjunction of globalization and a revolution in technologyand telecommunications made business far moredynamic and unpredictable.", "en": " 這是包柏，——還有包括我在內的我們中許多人—— 處理我們每天面臨的大多數商業問題的辦法 實際上，這曾是一個很好的商業思考模式 總的來說—— 這個模式直到1980年代中期還都很好用， 但當全球化的世代來臨、 革命性科技與遠端通訊 造成企業的經營，變化越來越快，越來越不可預測時，"}, {"zh-tw": " But what about those more dynamicand unpredictable situations that we now increasingly face? I think in additionto the mechanical thinking, we now need to master the artof biological thinking, as embodied by our six principles. In other words, we need to thinkmore modestly and subtly about when and how we can shape, rather than control, unpredictable and complex situations.", "en": " 當我們現在面臨更具變化和不可預測性的情況時 該怎麼應對呢？ 我認為除了機械式思考外 現在我們得掌握生物思考的藝術， 就像我們的六條準則所傳達的一樣。 換句話說，我們需要更審慎、敏感地思考， 我們要何時、如何 行塑這些不可測且複雜的情況，而不是控制它。"}, {"zh-tw": " It's a little like the differencebetween throwing a ball and releasing a bird. The ball would head in a straight line, probably towards the intended target, and the bird certainly would not.", "en": " 這有點像扔一顆球 和放飛一隻鳥的區別， 球會直線往前飛行， 還可能擊中你想打到的目標， 但鳥顯然不能。"}, {"zh-tw": " So what do you think? Sounds a little impractical,a little theoretical, perhaps? Not at all. Every small entrepreneurial company naturally thinks and acts biologically.", "en": " 所以，你們怎麼想呢？ 是不是聽起來有點不實際，又有點純理論化了，是嗎？ 一點也不。 每一個小型創業公司的想法與行動， 天生就會有生物性的特質。"}, {"zh-tw": " Why? Because it lacks the resourcesto shape its environment through brute force. It lacks the scale to buffer change, and it's constantly thinkingabout the tough odds for a start-up to survive.", "en": " 為什麼？ 因為它們缺少 塑造周圍環境條件的資源。 它沒有足夠可以迎接改變的規模， 且不斷地在思考 如何讓初創公司度過這些艱困、零散的挑戰。"}, {"zh-tw": " Now, the irony is, of course, that every large company started offas a small, entrepreneurial company. But along the way somewhere, many have lost this abilityto think and act biologically.", "en": " 現在，諷刺的是，當然 每一個大型公司都是由小型企業開始。 但是在發展的某一階段 許多公司丟失了生物化思考和行動的能力。"}, {"zh-tw": " They need to rejuvenatetheir ability to think biologically in order to survive and thrivein today's environment. So let's not just thinkabout short-term performance.", "en": " 他們需要重拾生物化思考的能力 以便在今日的環境中生存並繁榮。 讓我們不要再只考慮短期表現吧"}, {"zh-tw": " Every company I know spends plenty of time thinking about the centralquestion of strategy: How good is our competitive game? In addition, let's also consider the second, more biologicaland equally important question: How long will that game last? Thank you very much.", "en": " 我所知道的每一個公司都花大量的時間 思考他們的戰略核心： 我們的競爭力還有多少榮景？ 除此之外，為什麼不考慮 第二個，更為生物化而且同等重要的問題： 這場遊戲還能持續多久？ 謝謝"}], "title": "Martin Reeves How To Build A Business That Lasts 100 Years"}
