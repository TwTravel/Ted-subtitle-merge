Is it a product of natural selection, like our hands? Or is it a bug, a mistake in the system -- this religious stuff is just something that happens when the wires cross in the brain -- Jill has a stroke and she has this religious experience, it's just a mistake? Well many scientists who study religion take this view. The New Atheists, for example, argue that religion is a set of memes, sort of parasitic memes, that get inside our minds and make us do all kinds of crazy religious stuff, self-destructive stuff, like suicide bombing.", "en": " 至此，對像我一樣的社會科學家 有一個極其重要的問題： 這座階梯 是不是我們自進化所得來的？ 還是就好像我們的雙手 是與生俱來的? 或是它根本就是系統出錯 宗教這東西就像是 大腦中的線路錯接突然產生的現象 Jill中風時，她也有這宗教的經驗 這只是一時的出錯嗎? 許多研究宗教的科學家是這麼認為的 像是，新無神論者 覺得宗教是一系列的模仿 一種寄生的模仿 會入侵我們的想法 影響我們做出一系列瘋狂的宗教行為 或是自我毀滅，像是人體炸彈"}, {"zh-tw": " And after all, how could it ever be good for us to lose ourselves? How could it ever be adaptive for any organism to overcome self-interest? Well let me show you. In \"The Descent of Man,\" Charles Darwin wrote a great deal about the evolution of morality -- where did it come from, why do we have it.", "en": " 最終 失去自我對我們來說 真的好嗎? 不管任何生物體 怎樣可能有辦法 克服自我私利？ 讓我來告訴你 在《人類的起源》裡 達爾文寫了許多 關於道德進化論這件事 道德是從哪來的? 我們怎麼會擁有它?"}, {"zh-tw": " Darwin noted that many of our virtues are of very little use to ourselves, but they're of great use to our groups. He wrote about the scenario in which two tribes of early humans would have come in contact and competition.", "en": " 達爾文指出了許多人性的美德 只有極小部分有利於我們 但是對我們的社群卻是極其有利的 他寫了一篇例子 早期人類有兩個部落 會交流和比賽"}, {"zh-tw": " He said, \"If the one tribe included a great number of courageous, sympathetic and faithful members who are always ready to aid and defend each other, this tribe would succeed better and conquer the other.\" He went on to say that \"Selfish and contentious people will not cohere, and without coherence nothing can be effected.\" In other words, Charles Darwin believed in group selection. Now this idea has been very controversial for the last 40 years, but it's about to make a major comeback this year, especially after E.O. Wilson's book comes out in April, making a very strong case that we, and several other species, are products of group selection.", "en": " 他說：\"如果其中一方擁有 較多有膽量，有同情心 又忠誠的人民 且隨時願意幫助和保護別人 這個部落肯定會比較成功 並且征服另一個部落\" 他還說：\"自私和愛爭吵的人 無法凝聚一起 缺少同心協力 甚麼事情都不會有效果\" 換句話說 達爾文相信 群體篩選 這一觀點在過去的40年裡爭論不斷 但是今年，將會再度盛行 尤其是當E.O. Wilson的新書在4月份出版之後 會帶來很震撼的實例 書裡面說，我們和其他物種 都是群體篩選下的產物"}, {"zh-tw": " But really the way to think about this is as multilevel selection. So look at it this way: You've got competition going on within groups and across groups.", "en": " 但認真的思考下去 這就像是多重篩選 我們應該要這樣來看： 你一直都處在團體裡和團體間的競爭"}, {"zh-tw": " So here's a group of guys on a college crew team. Within this team there's competition.", "en": " 比方說有一群學生在划船隊裡 在這隊伍裡 一定有競爭"}, {"zh-tw": " There are guys competing with each other. The slowest rowers, the weakest rowers, are going to get cut from the team.", "en": " 學生們會互相較勁 最慢跟最弱者最終會被踢出隊伍"}, {"zh-tw": " And only a few of these guys are going to go on in the sport. Maybe one of them will make it to the Olympics.", "en": " 只有一小部分的人會繼續待在這個運動 也許其中一人能參加奧運"}, {"zh-tw": " So within the team, their interests are actually pitted against each other. And sometimes it would be advantageous for one of these guys to try to sabotage the other guys.", "en": " 因此，一個團體之中 個人的利益是互相競爭的 有時，會有人 經由陷害其他團員 而獲得個人利益"}, {"zh-tw": " Maybe he'll badmouth his chief rival to the coach. But while that competition is going on within the boat, this competition is going on across boats.", "en": " 好比在教練面前 毀謗團體裡主要的競爭對手 但當這個船上的隊員 彼此競爭較勁時 不同船隊間的競賽也在進行中"}, {"zh-tw": " And once you put these guys in a boat competing with another boat, now they've got no choice but to cooperate because they're all in the same boat. They can only win if they all pull together as a team.", "en": " 而當另一個競爭團體出現 他們就非得合作不可 只因他們在同一艘船上 他們想贏 就必須合作"}, {"zh-tw": " I mean, these things sound trite, but they are deep evolutionary truths. The main argument against group selection has always been that, well sure, it would be nice to have a group of cooperators, but as soon as you have a group of cooperators, they're just going to get taken over by free-riders, individuals that are going to exploit the hard work of the others.", "en": " 這聽起來是老生常談 但卻是演化上不爭的鐵實 群體篩選論 的反對者指出： 群體合作固然很好 但當一個群體只剩下合作團結者 他們將會被投機者利用而後推翻 自私的人會投機且剝削合作團體"}, {"zh-tw": " Let me illustrate this for you. Suppose we've got a group of little organisms -- they can be bacteria, they can be hamsters; it doesn't matter what -- and let's suppose that this little group here, they evolved to be cooperative.", "en": " 讓我解釋一下 假設我們有一群有機體 他們可以是細菌或倉鼠 他們演化成一群合作者"}, {"zh-tw": " Well that's great. They graze, they defend each other, they work together, they generate wealth. And as you'll see in this simulation, as they interact they gain points, as it were, they grow, and when they've doubled in size, you'll see them split, and that's how they reproduce and the population grows.", "en": " 這樣很好，他們一起分享食物，互相幫助 他們合作並繁殖壯大 如同這個模擬影片所示 他們良性互動，逐漸成長 當成長成兩倍大，他們分裂繁殖 他們的群體數量提升"}, {"zh-tw": " But suppose then that one of them mutates. There's a mutation in the gene and one of them mutates to follow a selfish strategy.", "en": " 但假設其中一個出現變異 他的基因突變 導致他自私自利"}, {"zh-tw": " It takes advantage of the others. And so when a green interacts with a blue, you'll see the green gets larger and the blue gets smaller.", "en": " 他利用其他無私付出的夥伴 當他們互動時 如您所見，綠色壯大但藍色萎縮"}, {"zh-tw": " So here's how things play out. We start with just one green, and as it interacts it gains wealth or points or food.", "en": " 這就是來龍去脈 一開始不過是一個綠色 但他在群體裡占盡便宜 從其他對象搜刮財富與食物"}, {"zh-tw": " And in short order, the cooperators are done for. The free-riders have taken over.", "en": " 然後很快的，合作者被耗盡 投機者取代了他們"}, {"zh-tw": " If a group cannot solve the free-rider problem then it cannot reap the benefits of cooperation and group selection cannot get started. But there are solutions to the free-rider problem.", "en": " 任何團體如果解決不了這難題 就無法促成團體利益 群體篩選論就不能成立 但其實，這難題"}, {"zh-tw": " It's not that hard a problem. In fact, nature has solved it many, many times.", "en": " 並非無解 事實上，大自然早已解決它許多次了"}, {"zh-tw": " And nature's favorite solution is to put everyone in the same boat. For example, why is it that the mitochondria in every cell has its own DNA, totally separate from the DNA in the nucleus? It's because they used to be separate free-living bacteria and they came together and became a superorganism.", "en": " 大自然絕佳的解決方法 就是把大家放進同一艘船 舉例來說 為什麼每個細胞的線粒體 有它們自己的DNA 跟細胞核裡的DNA完全分離 這是因為本來線粒體 是跟細菌分別生存的 後來它們合作共生 成為超級有機體"}, {"zh-tw": " Somehow or other -- maybe one swallowed another; we'll never know exactly why -- but once they got a membrane around them, they were all in the same membrane, now all the wealth-created division of labor, all the greatness created by cooperation, stays locked inside the membrane and we've got a superorganism. And now let's rerun the simulation putting one of these superorganisms into a population of free-riders, of defectors, of cheaters and look what happens.", "en": " 我們不懂它們如何變成共生體也許一方被另一方被吞噬 但當它們共同活在一個細胞膜內 它們就是同一個細胞 所有的努力，食糧 所有分工合作的成果 都鎖在同一個細胞膜裡 這就是超級有機體 現在，我們再試一次模擬程式 把這個超級有機體放進 一群投機者、背叛者、作弊者之中 看看會發生什麼事"}, {"zh-tw": " A superorganism can basically take what it wants. It's so big and powerful and efficient that it can take resources from the greens, from the defectors, the cheaters.", "en": " 超有機體基本上無懈可擊 它強大且有效率 可以從其它綠色的投機者、背叛者、作弊者 取得想得到的資源"}, {"zh-tw": " And pretty soon the whole population is actually composed of these new superorganisms. What I've shown you here is sometimes called a major transition in evolutionary history.", "en": " 過不了多久 整個群體就被超有機體取代了 我這裡所展示的 在演化的歷史上 被稱做主要過度期"}, {"zh-tw": " Darwin's laws don't change, but now there's a new kind of player on the field and things begin to look very different. Now this transition was not a one-time freak of nature that just happened with some bacteria.", "en": " 達爾文的進化法則沒有改變 只是當有新玩家加入 整件事就變得不一樣了 這個轉變不是一次性的大自然變異 只發生在細菌中"}, {"zh-tw": " It happened again about 120 or a 140 million years ago when some solitary wasps began creating little simple, primitive nests, or hives. Once several wasps were all together in the same hive, they had no choice but to cooperate, because pretty soon they were locked into competition with other hives.", "en": " 它再次發生 在約1億2千萬或1億4千萬年前 當一些獨居的黃蜂 開始建立一些簡單、原始的 巢穴 當越來越多胡蜂住在一個巢穴中 牠們別無選擇只得合作 因為很快的，牠們開始面對 其它蜂巢的競爭"}, {"zh-tw": " And the most cohesive hives won, just as Darwin said. These early wasps gave rise to the bees and the ants that have covered the world and changed the biosphere.", "en": " 而最有凝聚力的蜂巢會勝出 完全符合達爾文的理論 這些早期黃蜂的模式 後來被蜜蜂，螞蟻等引用 逐漸傳佈到整個世界 並改變了整個生態體系"}, {"zh-tw": " And it happened again, even more spectacularly, in the last half-million years when our own ancestors became cultural creatures, they came together around a hearth or a campfire, they divided labor, they began painting their bodies, they spoke their own dialects, and eventually they worshiped their own gods. Once they were all in the same tribe, they could keep the benefits of cooperation locked inside.", "en": " 它又再次發生 不過更驚人的 在50萬年前 當我們人類的祖先 變成有文化的生物 他們聚集在火灶旁 開始分工合作 他們開始在身上繪圖紋身、說方言 逐漸的，他們崇拜屬於他們的神 當他們屬同一個部落 就可以把獲得的利益鎖在部落裡"}, {"zh-tw": " And they unlocked the most powerful force ever known on this planet, which is human cooperation -- a force for construction and destruction. Of course, human groups are nowhere near as cohesive as beehives.", "en": " 人類的合作 開啟了地球上 史無前例的強大力量 創造的力量 與毀滅的力量 當然，人類的團體 一點都不如蜂巢那般有凝聚力"}, {"zh-tw": " Human groups may look like hives for brief moments, but they tend to then break apart. We're not locked into cooperation the way bees and ants are.", "en": " 我們也許一開始看似如此 不久後就趨向分裂與毀滅 我們的團體模式並不像蜜蜂或螞蟻般堅固"}, {"zh-tw": " In fact, often, as we've seen happen in a lot of the Arab Spring revolts, often those divisions are along religious lines. Nonetheless, when people do come together and put themselves all into the same movement, they can move mountains.", "en": " 事實上 就如我們在阿拉伯春天運動所見 我們的團體大多被宗教劃分 然而當人們群聚 因共同的目標而凝聚 大山可被剷平"}, {"zh-tw": " Look at the people in these photos I've been showing you. Do you think they're there pursuing their self-interest? Or are they pursuing communal interest, which requires them to lose themselves and become simply a part of a whole? Okay, so that was my Talk delivered in the standard TED way.", "en": " 看看這照片裡的人 你覺得他們在那 是在追求個人利益嗎? 或是為追求族群的榮勝 捨去自我 成為大群體中的一份子 好，以上就是我的演講 照著TED的標準方式呈現"}, {"zh-tw": " And now I'm going to give the whole Talk over again in three minutes in a more full-spectrum sort of way.

The staircase takes us from the experience of life as profane or ordinary upwards to the experience of life as sacred, or deeply interconnected.", "en": " 其中最大的共同點是登上隱藏的階梯 捨去自我 這階梯引領我們 從世俗的，平凡的人生 昇華到神聖的境界 且緊密的與他人連結"}, {"zh-tw": " We are Homo duplex, as Durkheim explained. And we are Homo duplex because we evolved by multilevel selection, as Darwin explained.", "en": " 我們人類是雙重的 如Durkheim所言 我們會變成這樣 是因多層級的演化篩選 如達爾文所言"}, {"zh-tw": " I can't be certain if the staircase is an adaptation rather than a bug, but if it is an adaptation, then the implications are profound. If it is an adaptation, then we evolved to be religious.", "en": " 我無法斷言這階梯的存在 是演化或是隨機變異 但如果它果真是演化 這含義極其深遠 若這是演化 我們勢必要成為虔誠的生物"}, {"zh-tw": " I don't mean that we evolved to join gigantic organized religions. Those things came along too recently.", "en": " 我不是說我們演化是為了 參加龐大的宗教團體 這種東西是近代的產物"}, {"zh-tw": " I mean that we evolved to see sacredness all around us and to join with others into teams and circle around sacred objects, people and ideas. This is why politics is so tribal.", "en": " 我是說我們進化出一種天性 能賦予自然神聖的含意 然後加入其他的群體 一同群聚在這神聖物品 人物或想法的周圍 這就是為何政治就像部落"}, {"zh-tw": " Politics is partly profane, it's partly about self-interest, but politics is also about sacredness. It's about joining with others to pursue moral ideas.", "en": " 一部分世俗，一部分是為了中飽私囊 但政治也是為了神聖的理想 與其他人緊密結合 追求崇高的道德理念"}, {"zh-tw": " It's about the eternal struggle between good and evil, and we all believe we're on the good team. And most importantly, if the staircase is real, it explains the persistent undercurrent of dissatisfaction in modern life.", "en": " 這是正邪之間永恆的抗衡 而我們老以為我們是正義的一方 最重要的 若這階梯是存在的 它解釋了人們內心隱藏的 在現代生活中永恆的不滿足感"}, {"zh-tw": " Because human beings are, to some extent, hivish creatures like bees. We're bees. We busted out of the hive during the Enlightenment.", "en": " 因為人類，或多或少 就像是群聚的蜜蜂 我們在啟蒙開化後離開舊巢"}, {"zh-tw": " We broke down the old institutions and brought liberty to the oppressed.
