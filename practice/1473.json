The news continues to give us a picture where men outnumber women in nearly all occupationalcategories, except two: students and homemakers."}, {"zh-tw": "所以我們看到的是非常扭曲現實的景象問題在於，當然新聞媒體產業裡的女性不夠多", "en": "So we all get a verydistorted picture of reality. The problem is, of course,there aren't enough women in newsrooms."}, {"zh-tw": "她們只在報章電視中報導 37% 的新聞她們只在報章電視中報導 37% 的新聞就算在那些性別暴力中的報導男性記者在版面和播報時間上得到了壓倒性的多數", "en": "They report at just 37 percent of storiesin print, TV and radio.

The Times was deluged with criticism."}, {"zh-tw": "一開始《時報》為自己辯護，說「這不是我們的看法這是我們在報導中找到的」這或許是個你已經知道的祕密你看到的故事都是被架構好的", "en": "Initially, it defended itself, and said, \"These aren't our views. This is what we found in our reporting.\" Now, here's a secretyou probably know already: Your stories are constructed."}, {"zh-tw": "當一個記者，我們做研究、我們採訪我們試圖拼湊出事實的完整真相", "en": "As reporters, we research, we interview.
