And what we found is that male lions are not the lazy hunters we thought them to be.", "en": " 這是獅子在各方向視野所及的範圍 直到視野被植被遮擋 我們發現 公獅並不是我們想像中 好吃懶做的傢伙"}, {"zh-tw": " They just use a different strategy. Whereas the female lions hunt out in the open savanna over long distances, usually during the day, male lions use an ambush strategy in dense vegetation, and often at night.", "en": " 牠們只是用了不同的策略 相較於喜愛在大草原 進行長距離狩獵的母獅 通常是日間狩獵 公獅更喜歡在夜間埋伏 在茂密的植被區域"}, {"zh-tw": " This video shows the actual hunting viewsheds of male lions on the left and females on the right. Red and darker colors show more dense vegetation, and the white are wide open spaces.", "en": " 這段影片說明 母獅跟公獅狩獵視域的差異性 左邊是公獅的視域 右邊的是母獅 紅色深色區塊 表示茂密的植被 白色區塊代表開放場域"}, {"zh-tw": " And this is the viewshed right literally at the eye level of hunting male and female lions. All of a sudden, you get a very clear understanding of the very spooky conditions under which male lions do their hunting.", "en": " 這個視域高度 就是公獅跟母獅眼睛看到的高度 你會突然瞭解 公獅狩獵時的 詭譎氣氛"}, {"zh-tw": " I bring up this example to begin, because it emphasizes how littlewe know about nature.

Basically, we need a high-tech accounting system.", "en": " 所以政策談判者當然會 持續努力減低森林砍伐 但是這些地區 在科學領域中 都是相對陌生的區域 如果不確實知道二氧化碳在哪裡 又該如何知道會失去什麼呢? 其實我們需要一個高科技的會計系統"}, {"zh-tw": " With our system, we're able to see the carbon stocks of tropical forests in utter detail. The red shows, obviously,closed-canopy tropical forest, and then you see the cookie cutting, or the cutting of the forest in yellows and greens.", "en": " 在我們的系統裡 你可以仔細看見 熱帶雨林的碳儲量 紅色區塊是熱帶森林的茂密樹冠層 然後像是蛋糕被切開 黃色跟綠色區塊是被開發的地帶"}, {"zh-tw": " It's like cutting a cake except this cake is about whale deep.

We've been using the technology to explore and to actually put out the first carbon geographies in high resolution in faraway places like the Amazon Basin and not-so-faraway places like the United States and Central America.", "en": " 驚人的是 儘管我們從高空飛過 分析之後 我們能進入 並且體驗樹冠層的 每一片葉 每一個樹枝 如同森林裡的其他生物一樣 親身體驗這些樹木 我們應用這種科技探索 並整合出第一份 高解析度的碳地圖 包含遙遠的亞馬遜河流域 還有鄰近的 美國跟中美洲"}, {"zh-tw": " What I'm going to do is I'm going to take youon a high-resolution, first-time tour of the carbon landscapes of Peru and then Panama.
