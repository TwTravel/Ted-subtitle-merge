I had just returned from one of the deepest divesI'd ever made at that time -- a little over 200 feet.", "en": " 當時我19歲 剛剛從那時所參與的最深的一次潛水歸來 比200英尺深一點點"}, {"zh-tw": " And I had caught this little fish. It turns out that particular onewas the first of its kind ever taken alive.", "en": " 在那裡我抓到了這條小魚 它成為了第一條被活捕上來後還能存活下來的魚"}, {"zh-tw": " I'm not just an ichthyologist,I'm a bona fide fish nerd. And to a fish nerd,this is some pretty exciting stuff.", "en": " 我不僅僅是一個魚類學家，我還是一個真正的魚癡 而對於魚癡來說，這是一個非常讓人興奮的工作"}, {"zh-tw": " More exciting was the factthat the person who took this photo is a guy named Jack Randall, the greatest livingichthyologist on earth -- the Grand Poobahof fish nerds, if you will. And so, it was really excitingto me to have this moment in time.", "en": " 而更讓人興奮的是，為我拍這張照片的人 名字叫做Jack Randall 世界上還健在的最偉大的魚類學家 你也可以稱他是魚癡的頭兒 因此，這個時刻的及時到來令我相當興奮 我以後的人生路線也由此劃定"}, {"zh-tw": " It set the course for the rest of my life. But really, the most significant,most profound thing about this picture is it was taken two daysbefore I was completely paralyzed from the neck down.", "en": " 但關於這張圖片最重要，最意義深遠的事情 是在拍完它兩天之後 我的頸部就完全癱瘓了。"}, {"zh-tw": " I made a really stupid kind of mistake that most 19-year-old males dowhen they think they're immortal, and I got a bad case of the bendsand was paralyzed, and had to be flown back for treatment. I learned two reallyimportant things that day.", "en": " 我犯了一個非常愚蠢的錯誤 就像大多數19歲的小夥子們，他們認為自己是死不了 我得上了嚴重的減壓病 全身癱瘓，不得不飛回來進行治療 那天我明白了兩件非常重要的事情"}, {"zh-tw": " The first thing I learned -- well,I'm mortal. That's a really big one. And the second thing I learnedwas that I knew, with profound certainty, that this is exactly what I was goingto do for the rest of my life.", "en": " 第一，我是終有一死的，這確實很重要 第二，我非常肯定地知道 我在餘生中所要從事的究竟是什麼"}, {"zh-tw": " I had to focus all my energies towards going to findnew species of things down on deep coral reefs. When you think of a coral reef,this is what most people think of: these big, hard, elaborate corals, lots of bright, colorfulfishes and things.", "en": " 我必須將精力都專注地投入到 對珊瑚礁深處那些新物種的發現。 現在，當你們想到珊瑚礁時，這就是大多數人所想到的 所有這些巨大、堅硬、精巧的珊瑚，還有大量多姿多彩的魚類以及其他 但，這僅僅是冰山一角"}, {"zh-tw": " But this is reallyjust the tip of the iceberg. If you look at this diagramof a coral reef, we know a lot about that partup near the top.", "en": " 如果你看一下這張珊瑚礁的圖表 我們對最上方的那部分瞭解很多"}, {"zh-tw": " The reason we know so much about it is scuba divers can very easilygo down there and access it. There is a problem with scuba, though, in that it imposes some limitationson how deep you can go.", "en": " 之所以如此，是因為 水肺潛水夫能輕鬆地下潛到那裡 然而水肺（水下呼吸器）有個問題 它給你的下潛深度設了限制"}, {"zh-tw": " It turns out that depth is about 200 feet. I'll get into why that isin just a minute, but the point is, scuba diversgenerally stay less than 100 feet deep, and very rarely go much below this,at least, not with any kind of sanity.", "en": " 大概是200英尺 等一會我會解釋這是為什麼 但，關鍵是水肺潛水夫們通常只待在100英尺深度以上 而很少，至少是有意識地潛到這個深度以下"}, {"zh-tw": " So to go deeper, most biologistshave turned to submersibles. Now, submersibles are great,wonderful things, but if you're going to spend 30,000dollars a day to use one of these things and it's capable of going 2,000 feet, you're not going to go farting aroundup here in a couple of hundred feet, you're going to go way down deep.", "en": " 所以，如果要到更深處，多數的生物學家會選擇潛水器 現在，潛水器是很了不起的東西 但如果你要每天花3萬美元來利用某個潛水器 而它能夠下潛的深度是2000英尺 那麼你肯定不會就在這幾百英尺的地方晃來晃去 你會向下，向下，潛到深處去"}, {"zh-tw": " So the bottom line is, almostall research using submersibles has taken place well below 500 feet. Now, it's pretty obvious at this point there's a zone here in the middle.", "en": " 歸根結底，幾乎所有利用潛水器的研究 都是在超過500英尺深的水下進行的 講到這裡，可以很明顯地看到中間的這個區域"}, {"zh-tw": " That's the zone that centers around my ownpersonal pursuit of happiness.

I'm just going to show you a basic idea.", "en": " 學習潛水的物理學和生理學過程 並找出如何克服這些限制的方法 我這就給你們展示一些基本的概念 此時此刻，我們呼吸的空氣其實是氧氣和氮氣的混合物"}, {"zh-tw": " We're all breathing air right now. Air is a mixture of oxygen and nitrogen, 20 percent oxygen, 80 percent nitrogen.", "en": " 其中大約20%是氧氣，80%是氮氣"}, {"zh-tw": " It's in our lungs.

The oxygen is bound by metabolism,we use it for energy.", "en": " 氧氣是我們獲取能量所必需的，與新陳代謝息息相關"}, {"zh-tw": " The nitrogen sort of floats aroundin our blood and tissues. That's fine, it's how we're designed.", "en": " 而氮氣只是我們血液和組織裡的某種漂浮物而已 這沒什麼關係，我們生來如此 問題在於當你開始下潛到水下的時候"}, {"zh-tw": " The problem happenswhen you go underwater. The deeper you go underwater,the higher the pressure is.", "en": " 潛得越深，所受到的壓力越大"}, {"zh-tw": " If you were to go downto a depth of about 130 feet, which is the recommendedlimit for most scuba divers, you'd get this pressure effect. The effect of that pressure is you havean increased density of gas molecules in every breath you take.", "en": " 當你到達大約130英尺的深度時 這是大多數水肺潛水者的建議極限 你就會感覺到某種壓力效應 即在你的每一次呼吸中 氣體的密度是逐漸增加的"}, {"zh-tw": " Over time, those gas moleculesdissolve into your blood and tissues and start to fill you up. Now, if you were to godown to, say, 300 feet, you don't have five times as manygas molecules in your lungs, you've got 10 times as manygas molecules in your lungs.", "en": " 過一會，這些氣體分子就會溶解到你的血液和組織中 並開始充滿你的體內 如果你要下潛到300英尺 那你的肺裡就不僅僅只充滿相當於平時五倍體積的氣體 而是充滿相當於平時10倍體積的氣體"}, {"zh-tw": " And, sure enough, they dissolveinto your blood and tissues as well. And if you were to go down to wherethere's 15 times as much -- the deeper you go, the moreexacerbating the problem becomes.", "en": " 肯定的是，它們同樣會溶解到你的血液和組織裡 當然，如果你繼續往下的話還有可能是15倍 潛得越深，這個問題就會越嚴重"}, {"zh-tw": " The limitation of diving with airis all those dots in your body, all the nitrogen and all the oxygen. There are three basiclimitations of scuba diving.", "en": " 而這個帶空氣潛水的極限問題 也就是在你體內的所有這些點——所有的氮氣和氧氣 水肺潛水有三個基本的限制 第一個限制就是氧氣"}, {"zh-tw": " The first limitation is the oxygen -- oxygen toxicity. Now, we all know the song:\"Love is like oxygen.", "en": " 氧中毒 我們都知道那首歌---“愛情就像氧氣， 得到太多，你會太興奮。"}, {"zh-tw": " You get too much, you get too high.Not enough, and you're gonna die.\" Well, in the context of diving,you get too much, you die also. You die because oxygentoxicity can cause a seizure.", "en": " 得到不夠，你就會死去” 在潛水這個問題上，你得到太多也會掛掉 導致死亡的另一個原因是氧中毒引起的急性痙攣"}, {"zh-tw": " It makes you convulse underwater --not a good thing to happen underwater. It happens because there's too muchconcentration of oxygen in your body.", "en": " 在水下，這可不是什麼好事情 罪魁禍首就是體內過高的氧氣濃度"}, {"zh-tw": " The nitrogen has two problems. One of them is what Jacques Cousteaucalled \"rapture of the deep.\" It's nitrogen narcosis.", "en": " 氮氣會造成兩個問題 其中之一就是雅克•庫斯托所說的“深海暈眩” 也就是氮氣麻醉 它會使你暈頭轉向"}, {"zh-tw": " It makes you loopy; the deeperyou go, the loopier you get. You don't want to drive drunk,you don't want to dive drunk.", "en": " 潛得越深，你就越暈 你不會願意醉酒開車，你也不會願意醉酒潛水，所以這確實是個大問題"}, {"zh-tw": " So that's a real big problem. And of course, the third problem is the one I found outthe hard way in Palau, which is the bends.", "en": " 當然，第三個問題也就是我在帛琉群島那段艱難旅程所發現的 減壓症（bends） 我忘記提到的一點是"}, {"zh-tw": " One thing I forgot to mention is that to obviate the problemof nitrogen narcosis -- all of those blue dots in our body -- you remove the nitrogenand replace it with helium. Helium's a gas; there're a lotof reasons why helium's good, it's a tiny molecule, it's inert,it doesn't give you narcosis.", "en": " 如何排除氮氣麻醉的問題 也就是我們體內的這些藍色小點 我們可以用氦氣來替換氮氣 氦氣也是種氣體，它有許多好處 它的分子很小，同時是惰性氣體 它不會導致你的昏迷"}, {"zh-tw": " So that's the basic concept we use. But the theory's relatively easy.", "en": " 這就是我們所用到的基本設想 但這一理論只是相對比較容易而已"}, {"zh-tw": " The tricky part is the implementation. So this is how I began about 15 years ago.", "en": " 最有趣的是如何將之變得可行 這就是我大約15年前著手開始時做的"}, {"zh-tw": " I'll admit, it wasn't exactlythe smartest of starts, but you've got to start somewhere. At the time, I wasn't the only onewho didn't know what I was doing.", "en": " 我承認，這肯定不是最聰明的開端 但無論如何，你總是要開始的而且那個時候， 我還真不是唯一一個不知道自己正在做什麼的人 幾乎沒有人知道"}, {"zh-tw": " Almost nobody did. This rig was actually usedfor a dive of 300 feet.", "en": " 這個裝置實際上是用於300英尺深處的潛水"}, {"zh-tw": " But over time we got better at it, and we came up with this reallysophisticated-looking rig with four scuba tanks, five regulatorsand all the right gas mixtures, all that good stuff. It was fine and dandy, it allowed usto go down and find new species.", "en": " 但過了一陣，情況有了一點好轉 我們搞出了這個看起來很是先進的裝置 上面有四個氣罐和五個調節器 還有合適的混合氣體以及所有要用到的好東西 它看上去既漂亮又時髦 能讓我們潛水去尋找新的物種"}, {"zh-tw": " This picture was taken at 300 feet,catching new species of fish. The problem wasit didn't allow us much time.", "en": " 這是在300英尺深處拍的照片，他正在捕捉魚類新種 但問題在於我們的潛水不能進行太久 儘管它的體積挺大塊"}, {"zh-tw": " For all its bulk and size, it only gave usabout 15 minutes at most down at those sorts of depths. We needed more time.There had to be a better way.", "en": " 卻只能保證最多在這樣的深度待15分鐘 我們需要更多的時間 必須找出更好的方法 而且，"}, {"zh-tw": " And indeed, there is a better way. In 1994, I was fortunateenough to get access to these prototypeclosed-circuit rebreathers.", "en": " 事實上，的確有個更好的方法 1994年，我幸運地有機會用到 這些閉路式換氣器的原型"}, {"zh-tw": " Closed-circuit rebreather:what makes it different from scuba, and why is it better? Well, there are three mainadvantages to a rebreather. One, they're quiet,they don't make any noise.", "en": " 那麼，閉路式換氣器-- 它與水肺有什麼不同， 又為什麼說它更好？ 換氣器有三個主要的優點 第一，它們很安靜，不會產生任何噪音"}, {"zh-tw": " Two, they allow you to stayunderwater longer. Three, they allow you to go deeper.", "en": " 第二，它們能使你在水裡待的更久 第三，它們讓你潛得更深 那麼，"}, {"zh-tw": " How is it that they do that? In order to really understandhow they do that, you have to look underneath the hoodand see what's going on. There are three basic systemsto a closed-circuit rebreather.", "en": " 它們是怎麼做到的？ 想真正瞭解它們是怎麼做到這些的 你必須把外罩拿掉，看看裡面是怎麼工作的 閉路式換氣器裡有三個基本的系統 其中最重要的稱為呼吸環路（breathing loop）"}, {"zh-tw": " The most fundamentalis called the breathing loop. It's a breathing loopbecause you breathe off of it; it's a closed loop, and you breathethe same gas around and around.", "en": " 顧名思義，你利用它來呼吸 這是個閉合的環路，所以你會一圈又一圈地呼吸同樣的氣體 這裡有個你要放在嘴裡的介面管"}, {"zh-tw": " There's a mouthpiecethat you put in your mouth, and there's a counter lung,or in this case, two counter lungs. The counter lungs aren't high tech,they're simply flexible bags.", "en": " （counterlung） 或者像這裡這個，兩個氣囊 這些氣囊並不是什麼高科技，它們就是簡單而又柔韌的袋子"}, {"zh-tw": " They allow you to mechanicallybreathe, mechanically ventilate. When you exhale, it goesin the exhale counter lung; when you inhale, it comesfrom the inhale counter lung.", "en": " 它們是你能機動地呼吸，或機動地換氣 當你呼氣的時候，氣體進入呼出氣囊 當你吸氣的時候，氣體從吸氣氣囊出來"}, {"zh-tw": " It's just pure mechanics, allowing youto cycle air through this breathing loop. The other component on a breathing loopis the carbon-dioxide-absorbent canister.", "en": " 這只是純粹的機械過程，使氣體能在呼吸環裡進行迴圈 在呼吸環上的另外一個部件 是二氧化碳吸收罐"}, {"zh-tw": " Now, as we breathe,we produce carbon dioxide, and that carbon dioxide needsto be scrubbed out of the system. There's a chemical filter in there that pulls the carbon dioxideout of the breathing gas, so that when it comes back to us,it's safe to breathe again.", "en": " 我們呼吸的時候會產生二氧化碳 這些二氧化碳需要從系統中除去 所以在那裡面就有個化學篩檢程式 將二氧化碳從呼吸的氣體中去除 這就使我們再次呼吸的時候，能安全地呼吸"}, {"zh-tw": " That's the breathing loop in a nutshell. The second main componentof a closed-circuit rebreather is the gas system.", "en": " 以上介紹的就是外殼下面的呼吸環 閉路式換氣器的第二個主要部件是氣體系統"}, {"zh-tw": " The primary purpose of the gas systemis to provide oxygen, to replenish the oxygenthat your body consumes. So the main tank, the main critical thing, is this oxygen gassupply cylinder we have here.", "en": " 氣體系統最重要的目的 是提供氧氣， 補充你身體所消耗的氧氣 所以主要的容器，最關鍵的東西 就是這邊這個氧氣供應罐"}, {"zh-tw": " But if we only hadan oxygen gas supply cylinder, we wouldn't be able to go very deep, because we'd run intooxygen toxicity very quickly. So we need another gas,something to dilute the oxygen with.", "en": " 但是，如果我們只有這麼一個氧氣供應罐 我們就不能潛得太深 因為我們很快就會產生氧中毒，非常快 所以我們需要另一種氣體來稀釋氧氣"}, {"zh-tw": " And that, fittingly enough,is called the diluent gas supply. In our applications, we generallyput air inside this diluent gas supply, because it's a very cheapand easy source of nitrogen.", "en": " 足夠合適之後，我們稱之為“稀釋氣體供應” 現在，在這個裝置裡，我們就可以將空氣輸入稀釋氣體供應罐中 因為這是一種非常便宜和易得的氮氣來源"}, {"zh-tw": " So that's where we get our nitrogen from. But if we want to go deeper,of course, we need another gas supply, and helium is whatwe really need to go deep.", "en": " 我們的氮氣就是從這裡來的 當然，如果想潛得更深，我們還需要補充另一種氣體 我們需要氦氣，它是我們深潛時所真正需要的 通常我們用的是這個稍微大一點的罐子"}, {"zh-tw": " Usually we'll havea slightly larger cylinder, mounted exterioron the rebreather, like this. That's what we use to inject,as we start to do our deep dives.", "en": " 它就像這樣掛在換氣器的外面 當開始向深處潛水的時候，注入的氦氣就來自這裡"}, {"zh-tw": " We also have a second oxygen cylinder,solely as a backup; if there's a problemwith our first oxygen supply, we can continue to breathe.

Normally, you don't have to do that, because all of it's done automatically with the electronics,the third system of a rebreather.", "en": " 它上面的閥門和旋鈕等可以讓你 在合適的時間注入合適的氣體 一般來說這些都是已經為你自動做好的 因為我們有電子設備，換氣器的第三個系統"}, {"zh-tw": " The most critical part of a rebreatherare the oxygen sensors. You need three, so if one goes bad,you know which one it is.", "en": " 換氣器上最重要的部件是氧氣感測器 你需要三個，這樣如果其中一個壞了，你就知道是哪一個 你需要表決邏輯（voting logic）"}, {"zh-tw": " You need voting logic. You also have three microprocessors.", "en": " 你還有三個微處理器"}, {"zh-tw": " Any one of those computerscan run the entire system, so if you have to lose two of them, there's back-up power supplies.

No; it only takes a couple minutesto get down to three or four hundred feet, which is what we're aiming for.", "en": " 有人問我，“到那兒一定花了不少時間吧？” 不，只花了幾分鐘 我們就直落到三四百英尺處，我們的目的地 有點像慢動作的跳傘"}, {"zh-tw": " It's like skydiving in slow motion.It's really very interesting.
