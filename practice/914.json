You can see where the oilis concentrated at the surface, and then it is attacked, because they don't wantthe evidence, in my opinion.", "en": " 你是可以看到浮油。 你是可以看到 海上的浮油集中在表面的地方， 但他們已經動了手腳。 我的看法是，他們根本不想要留下任何證據"}, {"zh-tw": " OK. We heard that bacteria eat oil? So do sea turtles.", "en": " 嗯 我們都聽說過細菌可以吞噬石油， 但是海龜也會。"}, {"zh-tw": " When it breaks up, it has a long way to gobefore it gets down to bacteria.

He said that in 30 years of fishinghe had never seen a dolphin do that.", "en": " 所以他把船駛離海豚， 過沒幾分鐘， 這海豚又出現在船旁邊了， 他釣了30年的魚， 從沒看過海豚會這麼做，"}, {"zh-tw": " And he felt that -- (Sigh) he felt that it wascoming to ask for help. Sorry.", "en": " 他覺得... 他覺得海豚是要... 尋求幫助。抱歉。"}, {"zh-tw": " Now, in the Exxon Valdez spill, about 30 percent of the killer whalesdied in the first few months. Their numbers have never recovered.", "en": " Exxon Valdez號油船漏油事件（註：發生於1989年） 短短的幾個月， 就殺死了約30％的鯨魚， 這些失去的數量沒有補回來過，"}, {"zh-tw": " So the recovery rate of all this stuffis going to be variable.

These tuna swim the entire ocean.", "en": " 所以這海灣是非常重要的海域。 重要性可能比 大西洋中其他的海灣還要大， 金槍魚在大西洋的每個角落都能看到，"}, {"zh-tw": " They get in the Gulf Stream,they go all the way to Europe.

I'm hoping that maybe the adultsare avoiding that dirty water.", "en": " 至少在今年， 這污油事件對牠們的產卵季是個大災難。 我希望這些能繁殖的成魚， 能避開受污染的水域，"}, {"zh-tw": " They don't usually like to go into waterthat is very cloudy anyway.

So this is a hemispheric issue.", "en": " 所以在格陵蘭長大的鳥類， 你在墨西哥灣也看的到。 這是個牽涉到南北半球的議題。"}, {"zh-tw": " The economic effectsgo at least nationally in many ways. The biological effectsare certainly hemispheric.", "en": " 經濟成長或衰退， 可能會影響到國家的許多層面， 但是生態的影響範圍是跨到整個半球，"}, {"zh-tw": " I think that this is one of the mostabsolutely mind-boggling examples of total unpreparednessthat I can even think of.
