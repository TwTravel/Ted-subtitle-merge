So I whisper-shouted back to him, \"Yes, the computer can tellif you're lying.\" Well, I laughed, but actually,the laugh's on me.", "en": " 那時我仍是個青少女。 所以，我用耳語大聲地回答他： 「能，電腦能判斷你撒謊與否。」 沒錯，我笑了，但可笑的人是我。"}, {"zh-tw": " Nowadays, there are computational systems that can suss outemotional states and even lying from processing human faces. Advertisers and even governmentsare very interested.", "en": " 如今，有些計算系統 靠分析、判讀面部表情，就能判斷出情緒狀態， 甚至判斷是否說謊。 廣告商，甚至政府也對此很感興趣。"}, {"zh-tw": " I had become a computer programmer because I was one of those kidscrazy about math and science. But somewhere along the lineI'd learned about nuclear weapons, and I'd gotten really concernedwith the ethics of science.", "en": " 我之所以成為程式設計師 乃因自幼便極為喜愛數學和科學。 過程中我學到核子武器， 因而變得非常關心科學倫理。"}, {"zh-tw": " I was troubled.

It's a black box.", "en": " 而且由於這是機器學習，不是傳統編碼， 沒有標記為「更高抑鬱症風險」、 「更高懷孕風險」、 「侵略性格者」的變數； 你不僅不知道系統在選什麼， 甚至不知道要從何找起。 它就是個黑盒子，"}, {"zh-tw": " It has predictive power,but you don't understand it. \"What safeguards,\" I asked, \"do you have to make sure that your black boxisn't doing something shady?\" She looked at me as if I hadjust stepped on 10 puppy tails.", "en": " 具有預測能力，但你不了解它。 我問：「你有什麼能確保 你的黑盒子沒在暗地裡做了什麼不可告人之事？ 她看著我，彷彿我剛踩了十隻小狗的尾巴。"}, {"zh-tw": " She stared at me and she said, \"I don't want to hearanother word about this.\" And she turned around and walked away.
