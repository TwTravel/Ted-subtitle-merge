What they don't say is, \"Well the numbers all seem to add up, but before I present this idea, I'll go and show it to some really crazy people to see if they can come up with something better.\" And so we, artificially I think, prioritize what I'd call mechanistic ideas over psychological ideas.", "en": " 那些已有理論框架 經濟學框架、工程學框架 認為邏輯是自身的答案 他們不會說：“數字看來是沒錯 但我要在報告這個想法之前我要去問問那些真正瘋狂的人 看他們能不能有更好的想法。” 所以我們人為地 將機械化思維置於心理學思維之上"}, {"zh-tw": " An example of a great psychological idea: The single best improvement in passenger satisfaction on the London Underground per pound spent came when they didn't add any extra trains nor change the frequency of the trains, they put dot matrix display board on the platforms.
