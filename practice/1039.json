And I know, in the light of human suffering and poverty and even climate change, one would wonder, why worry about a few cats? Well today we're here to share with you a message that we have learned from a very important and special character -- this leopard.", "en": " Beverly Joubert說：我們真的非常熱心於 非洲的自然原生態 以及對這些原生態的保護。 因此一直以來 我們都集中關注這些有代表性的貓科動物。 是的我知道， 相比起人類的苦難和貧窮 甚至是氣候變化， 你也許會問， 何必為幾隻貓操心？ 今天我們在這裡 和大家分享我們所學到的一個訊息 從一個非常重要和特殊的對象那裡學到的—— 就是這頭花豹。"}, {"zh-tw": " Dereck Joubert: Well, our lives have basically been like a super long episode of \"CSI\" -- something like 28 years. In essence, what we've done is we've studied the science, we've looked at the behavior, we've seen over 2,000 kills by these amazing animals.", "en": " Dereck Joubert說：基本上我們的生活一直以來 就是一集超長的“犯罪現場調查”（CSI）—— 整整長達28年。 根本上，我們一直所做的 就是研究這個學科，觀察動物的行為， 我們看到兩千多次 這種令人驚歎的動物施行的獵殺。"}, {"zh-tw": " But one of the things that science really lets us down on is that personality, that individual personality that these animals have. And here's a prime example.", "en": " 但是其中一樣科學無法告訴我們的 是個性， 就是每一個動物所有的獨特個性。 這就是主要例子。"}, {"zh-tw": " We found this leopard in a 2,000-year-old baobab tree in Africa, the same tree that we found her mother in and her grandmother. And she took us on a journey and revealed something very special to us -- her own daughter, eight days old.", "en": " 我們在非洲一棵兩千年的 猴麵包樹上，發現的這隻花豹。 就在同一棵樹上我們還觀察過她的母親 和她的外祖母。 她帶領我們踏上一段旅程 向我們展現了一些非常特殊的東西—— 她的女兒，八天大。"}, {"zh-tw": " And the minute we found this leopard, we realized that we needed to move in, and so we basically stayed with this leopard for the next four-and-a-half years -- following her every day, getting to know her, that individual personality of hers, and really coming to know her. Now I'm destined to spend a lot of time with some unique, very, very special, individualistic and often seductive female characters.", "en": " 當我們發現這隻花豹的那刻， 我們就意識到我們需要搬來這裡。 於是我們基本上就和這隻花豹在一起 在接下來的四年半時間裡—— 追蹤她的每一天， 逐步瞭解她， 她的獨特個性， 然後真正地認識了她。 我真是命中註定 要花大量的時間 和一些獨特的， 非常特立獨行的 充滿個性， 同時也非常有魅力的女性在一起。 （觀眾笑聲）"}, {"zh-tw": " Beverly's clearly one of them, and this little leopard, Legadema, is another, and she changed our lives. BJ: Well we certainly did spend a lot of time with her -- in fact, more time than even her mother did.", "en": " Beverly顯然是其中之一， 而這頭小花豹，Legadema則是另一個， 她改變了我們的生活。 BJ: 我們的確花了很多時間和她在一起—— 事實上，多過她媽媽和她一起的時間。"}, {"zh-tw": " When her mother would go off hunting, we would stay and film. And early on, a lightning bolt hit a tree 20 paces away from us.", "en": " 當她媽媽出去獵食時， 我們還在那裡拍攝。 早先時候，一道大閃電劈中一棵樹， 離我們就20步的距離。"}, {"zh-tw": " It was frightening, and it showered us with leaves and a pungent smell. And of course, we were stunned for a while, but when we managed to get our wits about us, we looked at it and said, \"My gosh, what's going to happen with that little cub? She's probably going to forever associate that deafening crash with us.\" Well, we needn't have worried.", "en": " 當時非常嚇人。 葉子像下雨一樣落到我們頭上，還伴隨著很難聞的味道。 當然我們有一陣都嚇懵了， 但當我們回過神來時， 我們看向那邊想說，“天啊， 那個小豹子會怎麼想？ 她可能會永遠地把 那聲震耳欲聾的聲音和我們兩個聯繫起來。” 其實我們一點都不需要擔心。"}, {"zh-tw": " She came charging out of the thicket straight towards us, sat next to us, shivering, with her back towards Dereck, and looking out. And actually from that day on, she's been comfortable with us.", "en": " 她從灌木叢中筆直地沖向我們， 坐在我們旁邊，瑟瑟發抖， 她背對著Dereck，四處張望。 事實上就是從那天起， 她接受了我們的存在。"}, {"zh-tw": " So we felt that that day was the day that she really earned her name. We called her Legadema, which means, \"light from the sky.\" DJ: Now we've found these individualisms in all sorts of animals, in particular in the cats.", "en": " 因此我們覺得就是在那天， 她真正獲得了屬於自己的名字。 我們叫她Legadema 意思就是“來自天空的閃電。” DJ:現在我們已經在各種動物身上 發現它們各自的性格。 尤其是貓科動物。"}, {"zh-tw": " This particular one is called Eetwidomayloh, \"he who greets with fire,\" and you can just see that about him, you know -- that's his character. But only by getting up close to these animals and spending time with them can we actually even reach out and dig out these personal characters that they have.", "en": " 這是Eetwidomayloh， 意思就是：烈焰騰騰。 你一看到它的樣子就能瞭解到，你知道——這就是它的性格。 但是只有通過貼近這些動物， 和牠們長時間在一起 我們才能真正接觸到 挖掘出牠們所具有的這些個性。"}, {"zh-tw": " BJ: But through our investigation, we have to seek the wildest places in Africa. And right now this is in the Okavango Delta in Botswana.", "en": " BJ:但是在我們的探索過程中， 我們不得不尋找非洲最為荒野的地方。 這裡是Okavango三角洲， 位於博茨瓦納。"}, {"zh-tw": " Yes, it is swamp. We live in the swamp in a tent, but I must tell you, every day is exhilarating. But also, our hearts are in our throats a huge amount of the time, because we're driving through water, and it's an unknown territory.", "en": " 是的，這裡是沼澤地。我們就住在沼澤地的一個帳篷裏。 但是我必須告訴你們，這裡的每一天都是激動人心的。 但是同時，提心吊膽的情況 也占據了多數時間， 因為我們要開車涉水， 而這裡是一片未知的領域。"}, {"zh-tw": " But we're really there seeking and searching and filming the iconic cats. DJ: Now one of the big things, of course, everybody knows that cats hate water, and so this was a real revelation for us.", "en": " 但我們確實在那裡 尋找，追蹤並拍攝這些大型貓科動物。 DJ: 其中一大發現就是，當然， 每個人都知道，貓不喜歡水。 所以這對我們來說真是一個大發現。"}, {"zh-tw": " And we could only find this by pushing ourselves, by going where no sane person should go -- not without some prompting, by the way, from Beverly -- and just pushing the envelope, going out there, pushing our vehicle, pushing ourselves. But we've managed to find that these lions are 15 percent bigger than any others, and they specialize in hunting buffalo in the water.", "en": " 而我們要想發現這個就必須逼著自己， 去到理智的人不會去的地方—— 順便說一句，Beverly起了很大的督促作用—— 這樣不斷地打破底線， 去到荒無人煙的地方，考驗我們的車子，也考驗我們自己。 但我們費儘艱辛終於發現，這些獅子 比其他獅子大百分之十五， 牠們的獨特之處就在於專門在水裡捕捉野牛。"}, {"zh-tw": " BJ: And then of course, the challenge is knowing when to turn around. We don't always get that right, and on this particular day, we seriously underestimated the depth.", "en": " BJ: 當然另一個考驗在於 知道什麽時候該掉頭轉向。 我們對轉向的時機把握的不是太好。 尤其是這一天， 我們嚴重地低估了水深。"}, {"zh-tw": " We got deeper and deeper, until it was at Dereck's chest-height. Well then we hit a deep depression, and we seriously submerged the vehicle.", "en": " 陷得越來越深， 一直淹到了Dereck的胸口。 然後我們撞進一個很深的窪地裡頭， 水把車子淹得很厲害。"}, {"zh-tw": " We actually managed to drown two million dollars' worth of camera gear. We drowned our pride, I must tell you, which was really serious, and we seized the engine.", "en": " 我們實際上不得不任由 200萬美元的攝像器材淹沒在水裡。 一同淹沒的還有我們的驕傲，我不得不說， 那次真的很嚴重， 而且發動機抱缸了（基本等於報廢）。"}, {"zh-tw": " DJ: And of course, one of the rules that we have in the vehicle is that he who drowns the vehicle gets to swim with the crocodiles. You will notice also that all of these images here are taken from the top angle by Beverly -- the dry top angle, by the way.", "en": " DJ: 當然，我們車上的其中一條軍規就是 誰把車開到水裡 誰就下去和鱷魚游泳。 （觀眾笑聲） 你還會注意到這裡所有的圖片 都是Beverly從高處拍的—— 順便說一句，是乾燥的高處。 （觀眾笑聲）"}, {"zh-tw": " But all the places we get stuck in really have great views. And it wasn't a moment, and these lions came back towards us, and Beverly was able to get a great photograph.", "en": " 但是所有這些令我們陷入困境的地方都讓我們歎為觀止。 這樣的事情發生過不止一次，這些獅子向我們走來， Beverly 得以拍到絕佳的照片。"}, {"zh-tw": " BJ: But we truly do spend day and night trying to capture unique footage. And 20 years ago, we did a film called \"Eternal Enemies\" where we managed to capture this unusual disturbing behavior across two species -- lions and hyenas.", "en": " BJ: 但是我們確實 日日夜夜 都在努力抓住那些獨一無二的瞬間。 20年前， 我們拍攝了一部影片，叫做“永遠的敵人” 在這部影片裡我們得以捕捉到 這種異常令人不安的行為出現在兩種動物之間—— 獅子和鬣狗。"}, {"zh-tw": " And surprisingly, it became a cult film. And we can only work that out as people were seeing parallels between the thuggish side of nature and gang warfare.", "en": " 令人驚訝的是，這片子竟然成為一部邪典電影。 我們唯一能想到的理由就是 人們看到了 自然界中殘忍殺戮的一面與 黑幫火拼之間的關聯。"}, {"zh-tw": " DJ: It was amazing, because you can see that this lion is doing exactly what his name, Eetwidomayloh, represents. He's focused on this hyena, and he is going to get it.", "en": " DJ: 這真是很神奇，因為你能看到這頭雄獅 確實像它的名字的含義一樣， 殺氣騰騰。 它盯上了這隻鬣狗， 即將要獵殺它。"}, {"zh-tw": " (Animal sounds) But that's, I think, what this is all about, is that these individuals have these personalities and characters. But for us to get them, not only do we push ourselves, but we live by certain rules of engagement, which mean we can't interfere.", "en": " （動物嚎叫） 但我認為這就是這部影片的目的所在， 即所有這些動物都帶有它們各自的性格和特點。 而在我們拍攝它們期間，我們不僅要挑戰自己的底線， 我們還遵循著一些互動原則， 就是說我們不能干涉。"}, {"zh-tw": " This sort of behavior has been going on for three, four, five million years, and we can't step in and say, \"That's wrong, and that's right.\" But that's not always easy for us. BJ: So, as Dereck says, we have to work through extremes -- extreme temperatures, push ourselves at night.", "en": " 這樣的行為已經持續了 大約三，四，五百萬年之久， 我們不能突然站出來說，“這樣是錯的，那樣是對的。” 但對我們來說往往不易做到。 BJ: 正如Dereck所說， 我們必須經歷很多極端的情況—— 夜晚我們被迫經歷極端的溫度狀況，"}, {"zh-tw": " Sleep deprivation is extreme. We're on the edge through a large part of the time.", "en": " 睡眠缺乏也相當嚴重。 在絕大部份時間裡， 我們都處在臨界的狀態。"}, {"zh-tw": " But, for 10 years, we tried to capture lions and elephants together -- and never ever managed until this particular night. And I have to tell you that it was a disturbing night for me.", "en": " 在十年間，我們試圖拍攝到 獅子和大象在一起—— 卻從未成功 直到這天晚上。 我必須告訴你們 對我來說這是非常不安的一個晚上。"}, {"zh-tw": " I had tears rolling down my cheeks. I was shaking with anxiety, but I knew that [I had] to capture something that had never been seen before, had never been documented.", "en": " 我熱淚滾滾， 焦急得瑟瑟發抖。 但是我知道這是爲了拍攝到 以前從未有人目睹，也從未被記錄下來的情景。"}, {"zh-tw": " And I do believe you should stay with us. DJ: The amazing thing about these moments -- and this is probably a highlight of our career -- is that you never know how it's going to end.", "en": " 而我堅信你們應該和我們一起看下去。 DJ:這些時刻的神奇之處—— 而這可能也是我們事業的精彩之處—— 就在於你從來不知道事情將會如何結束。"}, {"zh-tw": " Many people believe, in fact, that death begins in the eyes, not in the heart, not in the lungs, and that's when people give up hope, or when any life form gives up hope. And you can see the start of it here.", "en": " 很多人都會覺得，事實上， 死亡始於眼睛，而不是內心， 更不是始於肺部。 而這就是當人放棄希望的樣子， 或是任何生命放棄希望的樣子。 你可以看到，從這裡就開始了。"}, {"zh-tw": " This elephant, against overwhelming odds, simply gives up hope. But by the same token, you can get your hope back again.", "en": " 這頭大象，在寡不敵眾的情況下， 乾脆放棄了希望。 但是同樣的情況下， 你也可以重新燃起希望。"}, {"zh-tw": " So just when you think it's all over, something else happens, some spark gets into you, some sort of will to fight -- that iron will that we all have, that this elephant has, that conservation has, that big cats have. Everything has that will to survive, to fight, to push through that mental barrier and to keep going.", "en": " 所以就在你認為一切已經結束時，有什麽事情發生了， 一些小火花激勵了你， 某種戰鬥下去的願望—— 我們每個人都有這種堅強的意志， 這頭大象有， 自然保護區有，大貓們也有。 大家都有著堅強的意志去生存， 去拼搏，去衝破內心的關卡， 繼續前進。"}, {"zh-tw": " And for us, in many ways, this elephant has become a symbol of inspiration for us, a symbol of that hope as we go forward in our work. Now back to the leopard.", "en": " 對我們來說，從某種程度上， 這頭大象已經成為 激勵我們的一個象徵， 是我們投入工作時的希望象徵。 （觀眾掌聲） 現在回到這頭花豹。"}, {"zh-tw": " We were spending so much time with this leopard and getting to understand her individualism, her personal character, that maybe we were taking it a little bit far. We were perhaps taking her for granted, and maybe she didn't like that that much.", "en": " 我們長時間和這頭花豹在一起， 得以熟悉她的個性， 和個人風格， 可能我們和她的關係更親密一些。 甚至可能太過接納她的存在了， 而也許她并不喜歡這樣。"}, {"zh-tw": " This is about couples working together, and so I do need to say that within the vehicle we have quite strict territories, Beverly and I. Beverly sits on the one side where all her camera gear is, and I'm on the other side where my space is.", "en": " 當夫妻兩個一起工作時也是如此， 我需要說明的就是在越野車裡， Beverly和我有著嚴格的地盤劃分。 Beverly坐的那邊 放著她全部的攝影器材， 而另一邊是我的地盤。"}, {"zh-tw": " These are precious to us, these divides. BJ: But when this little cub saw that I had vacated my seat and climbed to the back to get some camera gear, she came in like a curious cat to come and investigate.", "en": " 這些分界對我們來說很重要。 BJ: 但是當這頭小豹子看到 我離開座位， 爬到車後面拿些照相器材時， 她就像一隻好奇的貓一樣 爬進來探索一番。"}, {"zh-tw": " It was phenomenal, and we felt grateful that she trusted us to that extent. But at the same time, we were concerned that if she created this as a habit and jumped into somebody else's car, it might not turn out the same way -- she might get shot for that.", "en": " 這很不尋常，我們也非常感謝 她對我們信任到如此程度。 但與此同時，我們也很擔心 如果她養成這樣的習慣， 跳到別人的車裡， 結果可能大不相同—— 她可能因此遭到射殺。"}, {"zh-tw": " So we knew we had to react quickly. And the only way we thought we could without scaring her is to try and simulate a growl like her mother would make -- a hiss and a sound.", "en": " 因此我們知道我們必須快速反應。 我們想唯一能做的 而又不嚇到她的方法 就是試著發出像她媽媽那樣的低聲咆哮—— 伴隨著嘶嘶的聲音。"}, {"zh-tw": " So Dereck turned on the heater fan in the car -- very innovative. DJ: It was the only way for me to save the marriage, because Beverly felt she was being replaced, you see.", "en": " 於是Dereck把車內的熱風扇打開—— 很有創意吧。 DJ: 這是我挽救這段婚姻的唯一方法， 因為，你看，Beverly覺得自己要被取代了。 （觀眾笑聲）"}, {"zh-tw": " But really and truly, this was how this little leopard was displaying her individual personality. But nothing prepared us for what happened next in our relationship with her, when she started hunting.", "en": " 但是的的確確，這就是 這頭小花豹如何向我們表現出 她獨特的個性。 但是我們絕對沒有想到 接下來我們和她之間發生的事， 那是在她開始自己捕獵後。"}, {"zh-tw": " BJ: And on this first hunt, we truly were excited. It was like watching a graduation ceremony.", "en": " BJ: 對於這第一次捕獵，我們真是非常興奮。 我就像在觀看一場畢業典禮。"}, {"zh-tw": " We felt like we were surrogate parents. And of course, we knew now that she was going to survive.", "en": " 我們覺得自己好像是代理家長。 當然，我們那時可以確定， 她將能夠生存下去。"}, {"zh-tw": " But only when we saw the tiny baby baboon clinging to the mother's fur did we realize that something very unique was taking place here with Legadema. And of course, the baby baboon was so innocent, it didn't turn and run.", "en": " 但只是當我們看到那個小小的狒狒幼崽 掛在它媽媽的身上時 我們才意識到一件非常特殊的事 正發生在Legadema身上。 當然，小狒狒完全不明白發生了什麽， 它沒有轉身逃走。"}, {"zh-tw": " So what we watched over the next couple of hours was very unique. It was absolutely amazing when she picked it up to safety, protecting it from the hyena.", "en": " 於是我們看到的 接下來的幾個小時 是極其特別的。 這絕對讓人覺得驚奇 她把它叼起來放到安全的地方， 保護它不被鬣狗叼走。"}, {"zh-tw": " And over the next five hours, she took care of it. We realized that we actually don't know everything, and that nature is so unpredictable, we have to be open at all times.", "en": " 接下來的5個小時裡， 她一直照料著它。 我們認識到我們其實并不是什麽都瞭解的， 大自然是如此的神奇莫測， 我們必須時刻保持著開放的態度。"}, {"zh-tw": " DJ: Okay, so she was a little bit rough. But in fact, what we were seeing here was interesting.", "en": " DJ:哦，她是有些粗魯。 （觀眾笑聲） 但事實上， 我們所看到的這一幕很有趣。"}, {"zh-tw": " Because she is a cub wanting to play, but she was also a predator needing to kill, and yet conflicted in some way, because she was also an emerging mother. She had this maternal instinct, much like a young girl on her way to womanhood, and so this really took us to this new level of understanding that personality.", "en": " 因為她自己還是一個想要玩耍的小豹子， 但同時又是一個需要殺戮的捕食者， 然而某程度上與之相矛盾的是， 因為她又是一個未來的母親。 她具備這種母性的本能， 很像是一個小姑娘正在成長為一個成熟女性。 因此這把我們帶到一個全新的層次 來理解她的個性。"}, {"zh-tw": " BJ: And of course, through the night, they lay together. They ended up sleeping for hours.", "en": " BJ: 當然，一整夜他們都靠在一起。 他們在一起睡了好幾個小時。"}, {"zh-tw": " But I have to tell you -- everybody always asks, \"What happened to the baby baboon?\" It did die, and we suspect it was from the freezing winter nights. DJ: So at this stage, I guess, we had very, very firm ideas on what conservation meant.", "en": " 但是我不得不告訴大家—— 每一個人都會問，“那個小狒狒最後怎樣了？” 它確實是死了。 我們懷疑是因為寒冷的冬夜。 DJ:到了這裡，我認為 我們有了一些非常堅定的信念 關於自然保護區存在的意義。"}, {"zh-tw": " We had to deal with these individual personalities. We had to deal with them with respect and celebrate them.", "en": " 我們必須面對這些獨特的個性。 我們必須帶著尊重面對牠們， 讚美牠們。"}, {"zh-tw": " And so we, with the National Geographic, formed the Big Cats Initiative to march forward into conservation, taking care of the big cats that we loved -- and then had an opportunity to look back over the last 50 years to see how well we had all collectively been doing. So when Beverly and I were born, there were 450,000 lions, and today there are 20,000.", "en": " 於是我們和國家地理頻道一起組成了“大貓保育計劃” 將它在保護區裡頭推展開， 以照顧這些我們喜愛的大貓—— 於是也有機會回顧過去50年來 我們都做了些什麽。 也就是說當Beverly 和我剛出生時， 大約有45萬頭獅子， 而今天大約為2萬頭。"}, {"zh-tw": " Tigers haven't fared any better -- 45,000 down to maybe 3,000. BJ: And then cheetahs have crashed all the way down to 12,000.", "en": " 老虎的遭遇也不樂觀—— 從四萬五千頭 減少到三千頭。 BJ: 獵豹的數量一路降低 到一萬二千頭。"}, {"zh-tw": " Leopards have plummeted from 700,000 down to a mere 50,000. Now in the extraordinary time that we have worked with Legadema -- which is really over a five-year period -- 10,000 leopards were legally shot by safari hunters.", "en": " 花豹則 從70萬頭銳減到 差不多5萬頭。 尤其是在 我們和Legadema在一起的這段時間， 大約5年多的時間—— 一萬頭花豹被假日獵手們 合法地射殺。"}, {"zh-tw": " And that's not the only leopards that were being killed through that period. There's an immense amount of poaching as well, and so possibly the same amount.", "en": " 而這還不是所有 在這段時間被殺死的花豹。 偷獵的數量也很巨大。 很可能也是一萬頭。"}, {"zh-tw": " It's simply not sustainable. We admire them, and we fear them, and yet, as man, we want to steal their power.", "en": " 這絕對是不可持續的。 我們欽佩牠們， 我們也畏懼牠們。 然而，作為人，我們想竊取牠們的力量。"}, {"zh-tw": " It used to be the time where only kings wore a leopard skin, but now throughout rituals and ceremonies, traditional healers and ministers. And of course, looking at this lion paw that has been skinned, it eerily reminds me of a human hand, and that's ironic, because their fate is in our hands.", "en": " 曾經有段時間 只有國王才穿豹皮， 但是現在，使用在所有的儀式和典禮上， 傳統的醫者和大臣們也穿著豹皮。 然後，看看這支獅爪， 已經被剝皮， 它詭異地讓我想起 人類的手。 而這很諷刺，因為牠們的命運的確在我們手中。"}, {"zh-tw": " DJ: There's a burgeoning bone trade. South Africa just released some lion bones onto the market.", "en": " DJ: 還有一個正在快速發展中的骨頭交易。 南非剛剛向這個市場投放了一些獅子骨頭。"}, {"zh-tw": " Lion bones and tiger bones look exactly the same, and so in a stroke, the lion bone industry is going to wipe out all the tigers. So we have a real problem here, no more so than the lions do, the male lions.", "en": " 獅子和老虎的骨頭看上去完全一樣， 因此很快地，獅子骨頭產業 將取代所有的虎骨。 由此我們真正面臨的問題， 沒有比獅子的問題更嚴重的了，尤其是雄獅。"}, {"zh-tw": " So the 20,000 lion figure that you just saw is actually a red herring, because there may be 3,000 or 4,000 male lions, and they all are actually infected with the same disease. I call it complacency -- our complacency.", "en": " 你們剛剛看到的2萬頭獅子這個數字 事實上只是一個幌子， 因為其中大約有3到4千隻雄獅， 事實上牠們全部 都感染了同樣的疾病。 我稱之為自傲—— 我們人類的自傲。"}, {"zh-tw": " Because there's a sport, there's an activity going on that we're all aware of, that we condone. And that's probably because we haven't seen it like we are today.", "en": " 因為打獵這種運動，它的存在 我們都知道，卻聽之任之。 而這很可能是因為我們還沒看到 這運動目前的狀況。"}, {"zh-tw": " BJ: And you have to know that, when a male lion is killed, it completely disrupts the whole pride. A new male comes into the area and takes over the pride, and, of course, first of all kills all the cubs and possibly some of the females that are defending their cubs.", "en": " BJ: 還有你們必須要瞭解 當一頭雄獅被殺死時， 整個獅群都被摧毀了。 一頭新來的雄獅會進入到該片領域 接管整個獅群， 然後，當然，首先就會殺死所有的幼獅， 可能還會殺死一些保護自己幼崽的母獅。"}, {"zh-tw": " So we've estimated that between 20 [and] 30 lions are killed when one lion is hanging on a wall somewhere in a far-off place. DJ: So what our investigations have shown is that these lions are essential.", "en": " 因此我們大概估算 大概要殺死20到30頭獅子 才能讓一頭雄獅的頭 掛到某個遙遠地方的牆上。 DJ: 因此我們的研究表明 這些雄獅是至關重要的。"}, {"zh-tw": " They're essential to the habitat. If they disappear, whole ecosystems in Africa disappear.", "en": " 牠們對棲息地來說是重要的。 如果牠們消失了， 整個非洲的生態系統都會消失。"}, {"zh-tw": " There's an 80-billion-dollar-a-year ecotourism revenue stream into Africa. So this is not just a concern about lions; it's a concern about communities in Africa as well.", "en": " 每年非洲可獲得價值800億美元的 生態旅遊收入。 所以這不僅僅是在關心獅子， 也是在關心非洲的社群。"}, {"zh-tw": " If they disappear, all of that goes away. But what I'm more concerned about in many ways is that, as we de-link ourselves from nature, as we de-link ourselves spiritually from these animals, we lose hope, we lose that spiritual connection, our dignity, that thing within us that keeps us connected to the planet.", "en": " 如果牠們消失了，那所有這些都完了。 但是我在更多方面的擔心是 當我們和自然脫鉤， 當我們從靈性上 和這些動物脫鉤時， 我們就失去了希望， 失去了精神上的聯繫， 失去了我們的人格，而正是這內在於我們的東西， 使我們保持與這個星球的聯繫。"}, {"zh-tw": " BJ: So you have to know, looking into the eyes of lions and leopards right now, it is all about critical awareness. And so what we are doing, in February, we're bringing out a film called \"The Last Lion,\" and \"The Last Lion\" is exactly what is happening right now.", "en": " BJ: 因此你們必須瞭解，此時此刻望向這些 獅子和豹子的眼睛， 所需要的就是關鍵性的覺醒。 所以我們要做的， 就是在2月將發佈一部電影，叫做“最後的獅子”。 而“最後的獅子”恰恰就是 現在正在發生的事實。"}, {"zh-tw": " That is the situation we're in -- the last lions. That is, if we don't take action and do something, these plains will be completely devoid of big cats, and then, in turn, everything else will disappear.", "en": " 這就是我們目前所處在的情形—— 最後的獅子。 就是說，如果我們不採取行動去做點什麽， 這些平原上將完全失去 這些大貓。 而其後果就是其餘的一切也將隨之消亡。"}, {"zh-tw": " And simply, if we can't protect them, we're going to have a job protecting ourselves as well. DJ: And in fact, that original thing that we spoke about and designed our lives by -- that conservation was all about respect and celebration -- is probably true. That's really what it needs.", "en": " 很簡單，如果我們不能保護牠們， 我們接下來的工作就是要保護我們自己了。 DJ: 而事實上，我們所談論的 也是我們照著去生活的最根本的東西—— 也就是保護區的意義就在於尊重 和讚美—— 這一點很可能就是真理所在；那就是我們真正需要的東西。"}, {"zh-tw": " We need it. We respect and celebrate each other as a man and a woman, as a community and as part of this planet, and we need to continue that. And Legadema? Well we can report, in fact, that we're grandparents.", "en": " 我們需要牠。我們彼此尊重和讚美對方 作為男人和女人，作為一個社群， 同時作為這個星球的一部份， 我們要將它延續下去。 至於Legadema？ 我們可以告訴大家，事實上， 我們做外祖父外祖母了。 （觀眾笑聲）"}, {"zh-tw": " BJ/DJ: Thank you very much.", "en": " BJ/DJ: 非常感謝大家。"}], "title": "Beverly Dereck Joubert Life Lessons From Big Cats"}
