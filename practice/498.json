They thought a C was all rightfor the neighbors' children, because they were all average.", "en": " 我創造我自己對成功的定義 在1934年,當我在印第安那州南本德的一所高中教書 有一點失望、迷惑，可能是因為 在我英文課堂裡年輕學子的父母 對他們的年輕子弟的期望 得到A或Ｂ的成績。他們認為Ｃ的成績是給他們鄰居的孩子的(美式評分: C-普通) 因為鄰居的孩子是一般的"}, {"zh-tw": " But they weren't satisfiedwhen their own -- it would make the teacher feel that theyhad failed, or the youngster had failed.
