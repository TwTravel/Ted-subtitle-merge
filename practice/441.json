So, the assignment I've been given may be an insuperable obstacle for me, but I'm certainly going to try.", "en": " 我對科技是一竅不通 我女兒，現在41歲了 在她5歲的時候，我聽到 她對朋友說 任何切下去不會流血的東西 我老爸是不會懂的 (眾人大笑) 所以，現在我要談的話題，對我來說 也許是項艱鉅的任務 但是我會全力以赴"}, {"zh-tw": " What have I heard during these last four days? This is my third visit to TED. One was to TEDMED, and one, as you've heard, was a regular TED two years ago.", "en": " 在這過去四天當中 我都聽到了些什麼？ 這是我第三次參加TED大會 前兩次，其中一次是TEDMED; 而另一次，就如你們剛剛聽說的 是兩年前的年度TED大會"}, {"zh-tw": " I've heard what I consider an extraordinary thing that I've only heard a little bit in the two previous TEDs, and what that is is an interweaving and an interlarding, an intermixing, of a sense of social responsibility in so many of the talks -- global responsibility, in fact, appealing to enlightened self-interest, but it goes far beyond enlightened self-interest. One of the most impressive things about what some, perhaps 10, of the speakers have been talking about is the realization, as you listen to them carefully, that they're not saying: Well, this is what we should do; this is what I would like you to do.", "en": " 這四天我所聽到的，我認為是非常了不起的 在前兩次我並沒有這麼深刻的感覺 許多的演講者 他們的演講內容中 傳達出的社會責任感 交織、交疊、交融在一起 實際上，是全球責任感 投合其開明的自身利益 但遠遠超脫了開明的自身利益 其中最讓我佩服的事是 有些主講人，也許有10位主講人 他們所說的是 他們的身體力行。就在你聆聽他們在台上的演說時，他們並不是在告訴大家： 「嗯，這是我們該做的；或這是我希望大家做的。」"}, {"zh-tw": " It's: This is what I have done because I'm excited by it, because it's a wonderful thing, and it's done something for me and, of course, it's accomplished a great deal. It's the old concept, the real Greek concept, of philanthropy in its original sense: phil-anthropy, the love of humankind.", "en": " 而是：「這是我目前已經完成的， 因為我很熱衷 因為這不僅是一個很棒的事，我也從中受益許多 而且目前我們也已經成就了不少」 其實這就是博愛，一個很古老、來自希臘的概念 在希臘哲學中的原始解釋是 博愛：對人類的大愛 (希臘字根phil-:愛; anthropos:人類)"}, {"zh-tw": " And the only explanation I can have for some of what you've been hearing in the last four days is that it arises, in fact, out of a form of love. And this gives me enormous hope.", "en": " 所以對於過去四天中我們在這裡所體會的 我能提供的唯一解釋 是這對人類的愛的昇華 而這讓我感到極大的希望"}, {"zh-tw": " And hope, of course, is the topic that I'm supposed to be speaking about, which I'd completely forgotten about until I arrived. And when I did, I thought, well, I'd better look this word up in the dictionary.", "en": " 而希望，當然 是我今天應該要談的主題 而我在到這裡之前完全忘的一乾二淨 當我抵達後，我想 喔，我最好去查查字典搞清楚這個詞的意義"}, {"zh-tw": " So, Sarah and I -- my wife -- walked over to the public library, which is four blocks away, on Pacific Street, and we got the OED, and we looked in there, and there are 14 definitions of hope, none of which really hits you between the eyes as being the appropriate one. And, of course, that makes sense, because hope is an abstract phenomenon; it's an abstract idea, it's not a concrete word.", "en": " 所以，我和我太太莎拉去了一趟公立圖書館 就在離這裡不遠四條街外的太平洋街上。我們查了牛津英文字典 我們仔細地查了整本字典，找到了希望的14個定義 但是沒有一個讓人覺得是一語道破的 一個簡明且適切的定義 而當然了，那是很自然的 因為希望是一個抽象的表現，一個抽象的概念 不是一個具體的名詞"}, {"zh-tw": " Well, it reminds me a little bit of surgery. If there's one operation for a disease, you know it works.", "en": " 這倒有些讓我聯想到了手術 如果某種疾病只有一種手術，你知道這個手術會有效"}, {"zh-tw": " If there are 15 operations, you know that none of them work. And that's the way it is with definitions of words.", "en": " 如果有15種手術，你知道沒一個是保證完全有效的 而定義一個詞也是如此"}, {"zh-tw": " If you have appendicitis, they take your appendix out, and you're cured. If you've got reflux oesophagitis, there are 15 procedures, and Joe Schmo does it one way and Will Blow does it another way, and none of them work, and that's the way it is with this word, hope.", "en": " 如果你得了盲腸炎，醫生開刀切除盲腸，然後你就好了 如果你有食道逆流的問題，有15種手術可以選擇 甲醫師選這一種 乙醫師選另一種 可是沒一個可以保證療效的，就像定義希望這個詞的情形一樣"}, {"zh-tw": " They all come down to the idea of an expectation of something good that is due to happen. And you know what I found out? The Indo-European root of the word hope is a stem, K-E-U -- we would spell it K-E-U; it's pronounced koy -- and it is the same root from which the word curve comes from.", "en": " 所有的定義都指向一種期望 期待好事終究會發生 可是你知道我發現了什麼？ 希望這個詞的印歐字源 是KEU這個字根 我們拼作K-E-U , 發音是「ㄎㄡ一」 跟彎曲(curve)這個詞的字根是一樣的"}, {"zh-tw": " But what it means in the original Indo-European is a change in direction, going in a different way. And I find that very interesting and very provocative, because what you've been hearing in the last couple of days is the sense of going in different directions: directions that are specific and unique to problems.", "en": " 而這個字根原本在印歐語言的意義 是方向的改變，以不同的方式發展 這讓我感覺十分有趣而且興奮 因為在過去幾天大家這裡所聽到的 就是改變方向的概念 採取不同且獨特的策略去解決問題"}, {"zh-tw": " There are different paradigms. You've heard that word several times in the last four days, and everyone's familiar with Kuhnian paradigms.", "en": " 針對一個主題的研究可以發展出多種不同的範式 「範式」這個詞過去四天來多次被提出 且人人熟悉庫恩的經典理論--跳躍式範型變革"}, {"zh-tw": " So, when we think of hope now, we have to think of looking in other directions than we have been looking. There's another -- not definition, but description, of hope that has always appealed to me, and it was one by Václav Havel in his perfectly spectacular book \"Breaking the Peace,\" in which he says that hope does not consist of the expectation that things will come out exactly right, but the expectation that they will make sense regardless of how they come out.", "en": " 所以，現在當我們想到希望 那表示我們必須跳脫在已熟悉的領域之外 另尋其他的方向 此外 — 不是定義，而是一個關於希望的描述 我一直很欣賞，瓦茨拉夫·哈維爾 他一本偉大的著作中「打破平靜」 在書中他說，希望， 不在於希冀所有事情 一定會有完美的結果 而是期待會有合理的演變發展 無論最終結果是如何"}, {"zh-tw": " I can't tell you how reassured I was by the very last sentence in that glorious presentation by Dean Kamen a few days ago. I wasn't sure I heard it right, so I found him in one of the inter-sessions.", "en": " 我無法形容，我有多感到欣慰 就因為Dean Kamen幾天前 在他的那場極佳的演說中所說的最後一句話 我不確定我當下有沒有聽錯 所以在一次中場休息時我去找他"}, {"zh-tw": " He was talking to a very large man, but I didn't care. I interrupted, and I said, \"Did you say this?\" He said, \"I think so.\" So, here's what it is: I'll repeat it.", "en": " 他當時在跟很多大人物說話，但是我不管 我打斷他，我問：「這是你說的嗎？」 他回答：「 我想是的。」 所以，這是他說的，我現在重複一遍"}, {"zh-tw": " \"The world will not be saved by the Internet.\" It's wonderful.

On an elemental level, we have all felt that spirituality at the time of childbirth.", "en": " 我指的是，我們每個人 都有這樣的能力 去成就更高的自我 去提升平凡的自身 去成就原本不以為自己有能力達成的目標 本能上，我們其實都已經體會過 那樣的靈性，打從我們出生後"}, {"zh-tw": " Some of you have felt it in laboratories; some of you have felt it at the workbench. We feel it at concerts.", "en": " 你們當中有些人已經在實驗室裡體會過 有些人是在工作台 或是在音樂會"}, {"zh-tw": " I've felt it in the operating room, at the bedside. It is an elevation of us beyond ourselves.", "en": " 我曾經在開刀房、在病床邊有過這樣的感受 那是一種昇華、超脫自我的感受"}, {"zh-tw": " And I think that it's going to be, in time, the elements of the human spirit that we've been hearing about bit by bit by bit from so many of the speakers in the last few days.

Now, we all think that Shelley obviously is the great romantic poet that he was; many of us tend to forget that he wrote some perfectly wonderful essays, too, and the most well-remembered essay is one called \"A Defence of Poetry.\" Now, it's about five, six, seven, eight pages long, and it gets kind of deep and difficult after about the third page, but somewhere on the second page he begins talking about the notion that he calls \"moral imagination.\" And here's what he says, roughly translated: A man -- generic man -- a man, to be greatly good, must imagine clearly.", "en": " 我很著迷於 在十九世紀初期 被提出的一個概念 更準確的說，十九世紀的第二個十年 由一位二十七歲的詩人 珀西·雪萊 (Percy Shelley) 提出 現在我們都認為雪萊是 偉大的浪漫主義詩人 大多數的的我們常忘記他也寫了 一些極佳的散文 最讓人印象深刻的一篇散文 叫做「詩的辯護」 這篇散文長約有五至八頁 而且大約從第三頁開始略顯艱澀 但是在第二頁當中 他開始談論 他稱之「道德想像」的概念 這是他所說的，我大約翻譯一下 一個人— 一個普通人 要成就不凡 必須清楚的去想望"}, {"zh-tw": " He must see himself and the world through the eyes of another, and of many others. See himself and the world -- not just the world, but see himself.", "en": " 他必須看清自己及這個世界 透過他人的眼睛 透過眾人的眼睛 去瞭解他自己跟這個世界— 不是只有外在的世界，更是看清自己"}, {"zh-tw": " What is it that is expected of us by the billions of people who live in what Laurie Garrett the other day so appropriately called despair and disparity? What is it that they have every right to ask of us? What is it that we have every right to ask of ourselves, out of our shared humanity and out of the human spirit? Well, you know precisely what it is. There's a great deal of argument about whether we, as the great nation that we are, should be the policeman of the world, the world's constabulary, but there should be virtually no argument about whether we should be the world's healer.", "en": " 去瞭解世上千萬人 對我們的期待的是什麼 世上無數人生存於 Laurie Garrett 貼切形容的所謂「絕望或不公」 他們對我們的期待的是什麼 到底是什麼，世界大眾有權力 去要求我們付出？ 到底是什麼，為了我們人類及人類精神 我們必須去要求自己付出？ 你完全知道答案是什麼 有一個很大的爭論 關於美國，我們這個的強大的國家 是否該扮演世界警察這個角色 成為維護世界秩序的力量 但是應該幾乎沒有人會有異議 關於美國是否該承擔起修復治療這世界的的責任"}, {"zh-tw": " There has certainly been no argument about that in this room in the past four days. So, if we are to be the world's healer, every disadvantaged person in this world -- including in the United States -- becomes our patient.", "en": " 在這過去的四天中，在這大講堂中 無疑的並沒有這樣的爭議 所以，如果我們要成為世界的治療者 世界上每一個弱勢者 — 包含美國境內 — 都是我們的病人"}, {"zh-tw": " Every disadvantaged nation, and perhaps our own nation, becomes our patient. So, it's fun to think about the etymology of the word \"patient.\" It comes initially from the Latin patior, to endure, or to suffer.", "en": " 每個弱勢的國家，也可能是我們自己的國家 都成為我們的病人 去細想關於病人(patient)這個詞的來源是很有趣的 這個詞的來源是拉丁文patior, 意思是去忍受、遭受痛苦"}, {"zh-tw": " So, you go back to the old Indo-European root again, and what do you find? The Indo-European stem is pronounced payen -- we would spell it P-A-E-N -- and, lo and behold, mirabile dictu, it is the same root as the word compassion comes from, P-A-E-N. So, the lesson is very clear. The lesson is that our patient -- the world, and the disadvantaged of the world -- that patient deserves our compassion.", "en": " 所以，你再回頭看看它的古老的印歐語系來源 你會發現其印歐語言字根 paen 拼做 P-A-E-N — 等等，這真是太妙了 跟憐憫(compassion)是同樣的的字根，P-A-E-N 所以，這教訓就非常清楚了。這教訓是我們的病人— 這世界, 還有世界上的弱勢者— 是我們必須憐憫同情的病人"}, {"zh-tw": " But beyond our compassion, and far greater than compassion, is our moral imagination and our identification with each individual who lives in that world, not to think of them as a huge forest, but as individual trees. Of course, in this day and age, the trick is not to let each tree be obscured by that Bush in Washington that can get -- can get in the way.", "en": " 但在我們的憐憫心之外，比憐憫心更重要的 是我們的道德想像 及我們對世上的 每一個個體的同理心 就像在廣大森林中 去關注每一顆樹 當然了，今時今日，要特別小心的是 不要讓華盛頓特區的 那叢灌木來礙事 (注：指小布希總統)"}, {"zh-tw": " So, here we are.

Now, if we're talking about medicine, and we're talking about healing, I'd like to quote someone who hasn't been quoted.", "en": " 我們身邊已經有很多的例證 在這15分鐘你們才聽到了 許多人不但身負這樣的使命感 甚至兼具領導魅力，還有傑出的才智 — 這令我想到在這大堂中滿滿的都是人才，天啊 聰明才智至少讓他們有了好的開始 在他們追求目標的路上 而無疑的他們會繼續朝目標邁進 只要我們有愈來愈多的人加入他們的行列 現在，既然我們談到 關於醫學 我們談到治療 我想要引用一位尚未被引用過的哲人的著作"}, {"zh-tw": " It seems to me everybody in the world's been quoted here: Pogo's been quoted; Shakespeare's been quoted backwards, forwards, inside out.
