That's no longer the provinceof science fiction.", "en": " 我們甚至發現了繞著兩個星球公轉的行星。 這不再是只存在於科幻小說中的情節。"}, {"zh-tw": " So around our own planet,we know there's life, we've developed a complex life,we now can question our own origins. And given all that we've discovered,the overwhelming numbers now suggest that there may be millions, perhaps --maybe even hundreds of millions -- of other [planets]that are close enough -- just the right distance from their starsthat they're orbiting -- to have the existence of liquid waterand maybe could potentially support life.", "en": " 所以我們知道，在地球之外會有生命。 我們已經發展出複雜的生命體，現在可以追溯起源。 根據我們所發現的數字顯示，巨大的行星－ 可能會有幾百萬， 甚至幾億個行星 － 離恆星夠近－ 也正好和它公轉中心有適當的距離－ 擁有能夠支持生命的液態水。"}, {"zh-tw": " So we marvel now at those odds,the overwhelming odds, and the amazing thingis that within the next decade, the GMT may be able to take spectraof the atmospheres of those planets, and determine whether or notthey have the potential for life.

It's an international project.", "en": " 所以我們現在驚嘆於這些巧合， 以及在下個十年將會有驚人發現， GMT也許可以採集這些行星的大氣層頻譜， 來決定它們是否有可能孕育生命。 所以，什麼是GMT計畫？ 這是一個國際計畫。"}, {"zh-tw": " It includes Australia, South Korea,and I'm happy to say, being here in Rio, that the newest partnerin our telescope is Brazil.

This happens underneaththe football stadium at the University of Arizona.", "en": " 取一大塊的玻璃，放到一個旋轉著的熔爐中熔化。 這是在亞利桑那州大學橄欖球場底下進行。"}, {"zh-tw": " It's tucked away under 52,000 seats.

It's what allows us to havethe precision that we will have.", "en": " 這是一個驚人的成果。 它讓我們獲得我們想要的精度。"}, {"zh-tw": " So, what does that precision buy us? So the GMT, if you can imagine -- if I were to hold up a coin,which I just happen to have, and I look at the face of that coin,I can see from here the writing on the coin;I can see the face on that coin. My guess that even in the front row,you can't see that.", "en": " 那麼，這樣的精度能帶來什麼呢？ 用GMT，想像一下。 如果我舉起這－ 我剛好有－ 我從這個距離看到上面的臉， 看清楚上面的文字和肖像。 我猜即使第一排的觀眾也看不到這些。"}, {"zh-tw": " But if we were to turnthe Giant Magellan Telescope, all 80-feet diameterthat we see in this auditorium, and point it 200 miles away, if I were standing in São Paulo,we could resolve the face of this coin.

This is what this cluster would look like.", "en": " 其實它離我們有上千萬光年。 這是星團的大概樣子。"}, {"zh-tw": " So look at those four bright objects, and now lets compare it with a cameraon the Hubble Space Telescope. You can see faint detailthat starts to come through.", "en": " 看這四個明亮的物體， 現在我們拿哈伯望遠鏡上的照相機相比。 你可以看到模糊的細節顯露出來了。"}, {"zh-tw": " And now finally -- and look how dramaticthis is -- this is what the GMT will see.

Extraordinary precision.", "en": " 這是用現在地球上最強的望遠鏡看到的， 然後這個GMT看到的。 非凡的精確度。"}, {"zh-tw": " So, where are we? We have now leveled the topof the mountaintop in Chile. We blasted that off.", "en": " 那麼，我們到哪？ 我們現在已經把智利的山頂弄平了。 我們炸平了它。"}, {"zh-tw": " We've tested and polishedthe first mirror.
