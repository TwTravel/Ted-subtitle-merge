And I had a high school science teacherwho would say to the class, \"The girls don't have to listen to this.\" Encouraging, yes."}, {"zh-tw": "我決定不聽他的話 － 但僅限於這句話。讓我帶你們到 智利的安地斯山脈，位於聖地亞哥東北方五百公里，相當於三百英里處，", "en": "I chose not to listen --but to that statement alone. So let me take youto the Andes mountains in Chile, 500 kilometers, 300 milesnortheast of Santiago."}, {"zh-tw": "非常偏遠，非常乾燥，但也非常的美麗。這裡幾乎什麼都沒有，", "en": "It's very remote, it's very dryand it's very beautiful. And there's not much there."}, {"zh-tw": "只有禿鷹、大蜘蛛，以及當夜晚降臨的時候，呈現出全球最黑的天空之一。這座山是一個奇幻的地方，", "en": "There are condors, there are tarantulas, and at night, when the light dims, it reveals one of the darkestskies on Earth. It's kind of a magic place, the mountain."}, {"zh-tw": "一個驚奇的組合：在偏遠的山頂上結合了精密的科技。自從有歷史記載以來，我們的祖先就一直眺望夜空，思考我們的存在，", "en": "It's a wonderful combinationof very remote mountaintop with exquisitely sophisticated technology. And our ancestors, for as longas there's been recorded history, have looked at the night skyand pondered the nature of our existence."}, {"zh-tw": "我們這一代也不例外。但困難的是那片夜空現在已經被城市的光害給遮蓋了。", "en": "And we're no exception, our generation. The only difficulty isthat the night sky now is blocked by the glare of city lights."}, {"zh-tw": "所以天文學家必須在偏遠的山頂上，才能觀察研究這個宇宙。天文望遠鏡，是我們能看見宇宙的窗口，", "en": "And so astronomers goto these very remote mountaintops to view and to study the cosmos. So telescopesare our window to the cosmos."}, {"zh-tw": "這句話並不誇張：有人說南半球將是21世紀天文學的未來。現在已經有一組天文望遠鏡陣列，座落在智利的安地斯山脈上了；而且不久之後，還會有更強大的觀測陣列加入。", "en": "It's no exaggeration to say thatthe Southern Hemisphere is going to be the future of astronomyfor the 21st century. We have an arrayof existing telescopes already, in the Andes mountains in Chile, and that's soon to be joined by a reallysensational array of new capability."}, {"zh-tw": "有兩個國際組織將會在這裡建造巨型望遠鏡，它對於光線極為靈敏，就如同我們的眼睛一樣。還有巡天望遠鏡，它會每隔幾天完成掃描夜空一次。", "en": "There will be two international groupsthat are going to be building giant telescopes, sensitiveto optical radiation, as our eyes are. There will be a survey telescope that will be scanning the skyevery few nights."}, {"zh-tw": "還有電波望遠鏡，能夠觀察長波長的電波。太空中還會有一座新的望遠鏡。", "en": "There will be radio telescopes, sensitive to long-wavelengthradio radiation.

That's almost 27 feet."}, {"zh-tw": "它可以完全遮住這個講台，也許還能延伸到第四排座位。這具望遠鏡的七面鏡片，每ㄧ片直徑差不多 27 英尺。", "en": "So it dwarfs this stage -- maybeout to the fourth row in this audience. Each of the seven mirrorsin this telescope will be almost 27 feet in diameter."}, {"zh-tw": "七面鏡片全部加起來組合成直徑80 英呎的望眼鏡。所以實質上，跟這個禮堂一樣大。", "en": "Together, the seven mirrorsin this telescope will comprise 80 feet in diameter. So, essentially the sizeof this entire auditorium."}, {"zh-tw": "這座望遠鏡大約 43 公尺高。同樣地，來到里約，有些人可能已經看過巨大的耶穌雕像。它們的大小差不多；事實上，雕像比望遠鏡小一些。", "en": "The whole telescope will standabout 43 meters high, and again, being in Rio, some of you have been to seethe statue of the giant Christ. The scale is comparable in height; in fact, it's smallerthan this telescope will be."}, {"zh-tw": "望遠鏡的尺寸相當於自由女神像。它即將安裝於一座 22 層的建物內－總高 60 公尺高。", "en": "It's comparable to the sizeof the Statue of Liberty.

It will have open windows to the sky, be able to point and look at the sky, and it will actually rotate on a base -- 2,000 tons of rotating building."}, {"zh-tw": "GMT 擁有哈伯太空望遠鏡十倍的解析度。它的敏感度是肉眼的兩千萬多倍。", "en": "The Giant Magellan Telescopewill have 10 times the resolution of the Hubble Space Telescope. It will be 20 million timesmore sensitive than the human eye."}, {"zh-tw": "它讓我們第一次能夠在太陽系以外的行星尋找生命。它能讓我們看見宇宙中第一束光芒就字面意思：宇宙黎明。", "en": "And it may, for the first time ever,be capable of finding life on planets outside of our solar system. It's going to allow us to look backat the first light in the universe -- literally, the dawn of the cosmos."}, {"zh-tw": "宇宙的黎明。它能讓我們看見過去，看見銀河系形成時的樣子，看見第一批黑洞以及第一批出現的銀河系。", "en": "The cosmic dawn. It's a telescope that'sgoing to allow us to peer back, witness galaxies as they werewhen they were actually assembling, the first black holes in the universe,the first galaxies."}, {"zh-tw": "人類觀察宇宙已有千年的時間，思索着我們在浩瀚宇宙中的角色。古希臘人告訴我們地球是宇宙的中心。", "en": "Now, for thousands of years,we have been studying the cosmos, we've been wonderingabout our place in the universe. The ancient Greeks told us that the Earth was the centerof the universe."}, {"zh-tw": "五百年前，哥白尼 推翻了這個概念，並將太陽放在宇宙的中心。幾世紀以，我們學到很多 －自從 伽利略 這位義大利科學家第一次將一個兩寸直徑的小望遠鏡指向天際，之後，每次我們建造更大的望遠鏡時，我們對宇宙就有更多認識；毫無例外地，每次都有新發現。", "en": "Five hundred years ago,Copernicus displaced the Earth, and put the Sunat the heart of the cosmos. And as we've learned over the centuries, since Galileo Galilei,the Italian scientist, first turned, in that time, a two-inch,very small telescope, to the sky, every time we have builtlarger telescopes, we have learned somethingabout the universe; we've made discoveries, without exception."}, {"zh-tw": "在二十世紀，我們發現了宇宙在膨脹。而且太陽系並非宇宙膨脹中心。現今我們知道宇宙是由大約一千億個銀河系構成，這是我們能看到的數量。而每個銀河系都有千億個恆星在其中。", "en": "We've learned in the 20th centurythat the universe is expanding and that our own solar systemis not at the center of that expansion. We know now that the universeis made of about 100 billion galaxies that are visible to us, and each one of those galaxieshas 100 billion stars within it."}, {"zh-tw": "你現在看到的是我們所能拍攝到宇宙最深處的影像。這是哈伯太空望遠鏡所拍攝，在哈伯升空之前這裡曾是一片空白的天空。", "en": "So we're looking nowat the deepest image of the cosmos that's ever been taken. It was taken usingthe Hubble Space Telescope, and by pointing the telescope at whatwas previously a blank region of sky, before the launch of Hubble."}, {"zh-tw": "想像一下這一小片區域，只是我們看到滿月的五十分之一。所以，像一下月圓的樣子。", "en": "And if you can imagine this tiny area, it's only one-fiftiethof the size of the full moon. So, if you can imagine the full moon."}, {"zh-tw": "這張照片中能看見大約一萬個銀河系。銀河系看起來小，光線微弱是因為他們離我們非常遙遠。", "en": "And there are now 10,000 galaxiesvisible within that image. And the faintness of those imagesand the tiny size is only a result of the fact that those galaxiesare so far away, the vast distances."}, {"zh-tw": "但每一個銀河系當中，都有數十億甚至數千億個恆星。望遠鏡也像時光機。", "en": "And each of those galaxiesmay contain within it a few billion or even hundredsof billions of individual stars. Telescopes are like time machines."}, {"zh-tw": "我們看的距離越遙遠所看見的就是更久遠的過去。它也像是能收集光線的桶子－", "en": "So the farther back we look in space,the further back we see in time. And they're like light buckets --literally, they collect light."}, {"zh-tw": "桶子越大，鏡面也越大；我們能看見越多的光線，也就能看見更久遠的過去。所以在上個世紀我們發現宇宙中有著非常奇異的物體 -- 黑洞。", "en": "So larger the bucket,the larger the mirror we have, the more light we can see,and the farther back we can view. So, we've learned in the last century that there are exotic objectsin the universe -- black holes."}, {"zh-tw": "我們也發現看不見的「暗物質」和「暗能量」的存在。你現在看的是一張「暗物質」的照片。", "en": "We've even learnedthat there's dark matter and dark energy that we can't see. So you're looking nowat an actual image of dark matter."}, {"zh-tw": "你對了。不是所有觀眾「看得到」。（笑）所以我們如何推測「暗物質」的存在 ？我們看不到它們－ 但是有引力場的存在。", "en": "You got it. Not all audiences get that. So the way we inferthe presence of dark matter -- we can't see it -- but there'san unmistakable tug, due to gravity."}, {"zh-tw": "我們看看這銀河系的星海處在一個不斷膨脹的宇宙中。我自己的工作是測量宇宙的膨脹。我在 1990年代參加的一項計畫用哈伯望遠鏡測量宇宙膨脹的速度。", "en": "We now can look out,we see this sea of galaxies in a universe that's expanding. What I do myself is to measurethe expansion of the universe, and one of the projectsthat I carried out in the 1990s used the Hubble Space Telescope to measurehow fast the universe is expanding."}, {"zh-tw": "我們現在可以追溯到 140億年前。知道每一個星球都有自己的一段歷史；它們有出生，有中年時期，有些很戲劇性的死亡。", "en": "We can now trace back to 14 billion years. We've learned over timethat stars have individual histories; that is, they have birth,they have middle ages and some of themeven have dramatic deaths."}, {"zh-tw": "由這些死亡星球的殘骸變成了新的星球，甚至有些還有行星圍繞著它們。過去 20年裡最驚人的發現之一就是圍繞著其他恆星公轉的行星。", "en": "So the embers from those stars actuallythen form the new stars that we see, most of which turn out to haveplanets going around them. And one of the really surprising resultsin the last 20 years has been the discoveryof other planets going around other stars."}, {"zh-tw": "它們是「太陽系外行星」。直到 1995年，我們才知道其它行星的存在－除了繞著我們太陽旋轉之外的行星。", "en": "These are called exoplanets. And until 1995, we didn't even knowthe existence of any other planets, other than going around our own sun."}, {"zh-tw": "但是現在，有大約 2000個太陽系外行星－我們能觀測且測量質量。500個「多行星」系統，", "en": "But now, there are almost 2,000other planets orbiting other stars that we can now detect,measure masses for. There are 500 of thosethat are multiple-planet systems."}, {"zh-tw": "4000 個數量仍在增加的「太陽系外行星」的候選者。它們有各種形式的呈現。", "en": "And there are 4,000 --and still counting -- other candidates for planets orbiting other stars. They come in a bewildering varietyof different kinds."}, {"zh-tw": "有類似木星、溫度很高的星球，有冰的、有水的，有全是石頭的行星、像地球一樣－ 叫做「超級地球」，甚至還有被認為全都是鑽石的行星。所以我們知道至少有一個星球有生命－ 我們的地球。", "en": "There are Jupiter-likeplanets that are hot, there are other planets that are icy,there are water worlds and there are rocky planetslike the Earth, so-called \"super-Earths,\" and there have even been planetsthat have been speculated diamond worlds. So we know there's at least one planet,our own Earth, in which there is life."}, {"zh-tw": "我們甚至發現了繞著兩個星球公轉的行星。這不再是只存在於科幻小說中的情節。", "en": "We've even found planetsthat are orbiting two stars. That's no longer the provinceof science fiction."}, {"zh-tw": "所以我們知道，在地球之外會有生命。我們已經發展出複雜的生命體，現在可以追溯起源。根據我們所發現的數字顯示，巨大的行星－可能會有幾百萬， 甚至幾億個行星 －離恆星夠近－也正好和它公轉中心有適當的距離－擁有能夠支持生命的液態水。", "en": "So around our own planet,we know there's life, we've developed a complex life,we now can question our own origins. And given all that we've discovered,the overwhelming numbers now suggest that there may be millions, perhaps --maybe even hundreds of millions -- of other [planets]that are close enough -- just the right distance from their starsthat they're orbiting -- to have the existence of liquid waterand maybe could potentially support life."}, {"zh-tw": "所以我們現在驚嘆於這些巧合，以及在下個十年將會有驚人發現，GMT也許可以採集這些行星的大氣層頻譜，來決定它們是否有可能孕育生命。所以，什麼是GMT計畫？這是一個國際計畫。", "en": "So we marvel now at those odds,the overwhelming odds, and the amazing thingis that within the next decade, the GMT may be able to take spectraof the atmospheres of those planets, and determine whether or notthey have the potential for life. So, what is the GMT project? It's an international project."}, {"zh-tw": "參與有澳大利亞，韓國，並且在里約這裡—我很高興地說，我們有新成員：巴西。參與計畫的還有一些美國機構，包括哈佛大學、斯密森學會、和卡耐基學院、亞利桑那大學、芝加哥大學、德克薩斯奧斯丁大學、和德州農工大學。", "en": "It includes Australia, South Korea,and I'm happy to say, being here in Rio, that the newest partnerin our telescope is Brazil. It also includes a number of institutionsacross the United States, including Harvard University, the Smithsonianand the Carnegie Institutions, and the Universities of Arizona, Chicago,Texas-Austin and Texas A&M University."}, {"zh-tw": "智利也參與其中。望遠鏡鏡片製造本身就很迷人。", "en": "It also involves Chile. So, the making of the mirrorsin this telescope is also fascinating in its own right."}, {"zh-tw": "取一大塊的玻璃，放到一個旋轉著的熔爐中熔化。這是在亞利桑那州大學橄欖球場底下進行。", "en": "Take chunks of glass, melt themin a furnace that is itself rotating. This happens underneaththe football stadium at the University of Arizona."}, {"zh-tw": "它藏在五萬兩千張椅子之下。沒人知道他的存在。", "en": "It's tucked away under 52,000 seats. Nobody know it's happening."}, {"zh-tw": "那本來就有一個旋轉時的大鍋。鏡片成形，並且慢慢冷卻，然後精緻打磨。", "en": "And there's essentiallya rotating cauldron. The mirrors are castand they're cooled very slowly, and then they're polishedto an exquisite precision."}, {"zh-tw": "你可以想一下鏡片的精細度：隆起顆粒在直徑27呎的整個鏡面上，總合不超過百萬分之一英寸。所以你能想像到嗎？噢！（笑）是我這根頭髮直徑的五千分之一，在27呎的鏡面之上。", "en": "And so, if you thinkabout the precision of these mirrors, the bumps on the mirror,over the entire 27 feet, amount to lessthan one-millionth of an inch. So, can you visualize that? Ow! That's one five-thousandthsof the width of one of my hairs, over this entire 27 feet."}, {"zh-tw": "這是一個驚人的成果。它讓我們獲得我們想要的精度。", "en": "It's a spectacular achievement. It's what allows us to havethe precision that we will have."}, {"zh-tw": "那麼，這樣的精度能帶來什麼呢？用GMT，想像一下。如果我舉起這－ 我剛好有－我從這個距離看到上面的臉，看清楚上面的文字和肖像。我猜即使第一排的觀眾也看不到這些。", "en": "So, what does that precision buy us? So the GMT, if you can imagine -- if I were to hold up a coin,which I just happen to have, and I look at the face of that coin,I can see from here the writing on the coin;I can see the face on that coin. My guess that even in the front row,you can't see that."}, {"zh-tw": "如果我用GMT來看我們會在這禮堂用直徑80英尺的GMT對準200英里（約320公里）以外如果我站在聖保羅，大家依舊可以看清這個硬幣。就是這個望遠鏡非凡的解析度與能力。", "en": "But if we were to turnthe Giant Magellan Telescope, all 80-feet diameterthat we see in this auditorium, and point it 200 miles away, if I were standing in São Paulo,we could resolve the face of this coin. That's the extraordinary resolutionand power of this telescope."}, {"zh-tw": "如果我們－如果太空人到了月球，離此 25萬 哩外，然後點起一根蠟燭－ 就一根 －我們用GMT 能看得到。相當非凡。", "en": "And if we were -- If an astronaut went up to the Moon,a quarter of a million miles away, and lit a candle -- a single candle -- then we would be ableto detect it, using the GMT. Quite extraordinary."}, {"zh-tw": "這是附近銀河系的星團模擬圖。「附近」是「天文觀測」的相對的概念。", "en": "This is a simulated imageof a cluster in a nearby galaxy. \"Nearby\" is astronomical,it's all relative."}, {"zh-tw": "其實它離我們有上千萬光年。這是星團的大概樣子。", "en": "It's tens of millions of light-years away. This is what this cluster would look like."}, {"zh-tw": "看這四個明亮的物體，現在我們拿哈伯望遠鏡上的照相機相比。你可以看到模糊的細節顯露出來了。", "en": "So look at those four bright objects, and now lets compare it with a cameraon the Hubble Space Telescope. You can see faint detailthat starts to come through."}, {"zh-tw": "最後看看這個－ 多麼驚人－由 GMT 看到的圖像。注意那幾個亮點。", "en": "And now finally -- and look how dramaticthis is -- this is what the GMT will see. So, keep your eyes on thosebright images again."}, {"zh-tw": "這是用現在地球上最強的望遠鏡看到的，然後這個GMT看到的。非凡的精確度。", "en": "This is what we see on one of the mostpowerful existing telescopes on the Earth, and this, again, what the GMT will see. Extraordinary precision."}, {"zh-tw": "那麼，我們到哪？我們現在已經把智利的山頂弄平了。我們炸平了它。", "en": "So, where are we? We have now leveled the topof the mountaintop in Chile. We blasted that off."}, {"zh-tw": "我們已測試與拋光第一面鏡片。已鑄造第二面和第三面。", "en": "We've tested and polishedthe first mirror. We've cast the secondand the third mirrors."}, {"zh-tw": "我們即將鑄造第四面鏡片。今年我們做了一系列的審查，國際委員會審查我們，他們說：「你們已經能開始建造了」。所以我們計劃用前四面鏡片建造這個望遠鏡。", "en": "And we're about to cast the fourth mirror. We had a series of reviews this year, international panelsthat came in and reviewed us, and said, \"You're readyto go to construction.\" And so we plan on building this telescopewith the first four mirrors."}, {"zh-tw": "我們想儘早完工，開始收集科學數據－天文學家所謂的 2021年「第一曙光」。整個望遠鏡將在未來的十年中期完工，七面鏡片將悉數完成。", "en": "We want to get on the air quickly,and be taking science data -- what we astronomers call\"first light,\" in 2021. And the full telescope will be finishedin the middle of the next decade, with all seven mirrors."}, {"zh-tw": "我們將回顧遙遠的宇宙，宇宙之黎明。我們將能詳細研究其它的行星。", "en": "So we're now poised to look backat the distant universe, the cosmic dawn. We'll be able to study other planetsin exquisite detail."}, {"zh-tw": "但對我而言，建造GMT最令人興奮的 －莫過於真正探索事物的機會，探索未知的－ 甚至現在無法想像的事物，一個全新的世界。我的希望是這些設施的建造將能鼓舞年輕人去追求探索這些星球。", "en": "But for me, one of the mostexciting things about building the GMT is the opportunityto actually discover something that we don't know about --that we can't even imagine at this point, something completely new. And my hope is that with the constructionof this and other facilities, that many young women and menwill be inspired to reach for the stars."}, {"zh-tw": "很感謝。謝謝（葡語）", "en": "Thank you very much. Obrigado."}, {"zh-tw": "布魯諾：謝謝你，溫蒂。等一下，我有個問題要請教你。", "en": "Bruno Giussani: Thank you, Wendy. Stay with me, becauseI have a question for you."}, {"zh-tw": "你提到了不同的設施。所以說麥哲倫望遠鏡正在阿爾馬，智利以及夏威夷等地建造。", "en": "You mentioned different facilities. So the Magellan Telescope is going up,but also ALMA and others in Chile and elsewhere, including in Hawaii."}, {"zh-tw": "它們會涉及合作，互補或者競爭嗎？我知道有關經費的競爭，那麼科學方面呢？溫蒂：科學方面是完全互補的。不論是太空或是地面望遠鏡，探測不同波長的望遠鏡，相似卻又不同的望遠鏡設備－它們探索問題的不同層面。", "en": "Is it about cooperationand complementarity, or about competition? I know there's competition in termsof funding, but what about the science? Wendy Freedman: In terms of the science,they're very complementary. The telescopes that are in space,the telescopes on the ground, telescopes with differentwavelength capability, telescopes even that are similar,but different instruments -- they will all look at different partsof the questions that we're asking."}, {"zh-tw": "當我們探索行星的時，我們將能夠嘗試不同的觀測、測量大氣狀況、以及能以高清晰度來觀察太空。所以他們都是互補的。", "en": "So when we discover other planets,we'll be able to test those observations, we'll be able to measure the atmospheres, be able to look in spacewith very high resolution.
