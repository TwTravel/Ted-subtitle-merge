And my question is this: \"why are we ignoring the oceans?\" Here's the reason, or not the reason, but here's why I ask that question.", "en": " 也就是NOAA，國家海洋與大氣管理局 而我的疑問是 -- 我們為什麼忽略海洋？ 也許這是原因、或者這不是，但這就是我為什麼要問"}, {"zh-tw": " If you compare NASA's annual budget to explore the heavens, that one-year budget would fund NOAA's budget to explore the oceans for 1,600 years. Why? Why are we looking up? Is it because it's heaven? And hell is down here? Is it a cultural issue? Why are people afraid of the ocean? Or do they just assume the ocean is just a dark, gloomy place that has nothing to offer? I'm going to take you on a 16-minute trip on 72 percent of the planet, so buckle up.", "en": " 如果比較太空總署探索太空的年度預算 這一年的預算可以支持NOAA 探索海洋一千六百年 為什麼？為什麼我們往上看？難道是因為天堂在上面？ 而地獄在下面？這是因為文化的影響嗎？ 為什麼人們害怕海洋？ 或他們認為海洋只是一片漆黑、又陰森的地方 一點貢獻也沒有 繫好安全帶，我將帶領你們在下面16分鐘遊遍這佔地球72％的地方"}, {"zh-tw": " OK. And what we're going to do is we're going to immerse ourselves in my world.

Is it a hot spot?\" No, no, that's the only place a ship's been.", "en": " 這不是地圖 我有另一個版本在我辦公室裡 而我問人們：「為什麼這裡，這塊區域有山脈」 「而那邊卻沒有呢？」他們通常都會說：「嗯～天啊」 「我不知道耶」 「這是地質脆弱地區嗎？它是熱點嗎？」 不不～那些地方只有船去過"}, {"zh-tw": " Most of the southern hemisphere is unexplored. We had more exploration ships down there during Captain Cook's time than now. It's amazing.", "en": " 大部分的南半球都沒有被探索過 我們曾有很多探測船隻在那裡 是在庫克船長的時代，比現代還多，這真叫人吃驚！"}, {"zh-tw": " All right.

OK. Now, I began my explorations the hard way. Back then -- actually my first expedition was when I was 17 years old.

And over the last 49 years, I've done about 120, 121 -- I keep doing them -- expeditions.

Because it's along the axis of the mid-ocean ridge where the great crustal plates are separating.", "en": " 當時的地球科學家們對於這山脈的最大興趣 不只是因為山脈在這星球上佔據極大面積 而是山脈在地球外層形成時所扮演的角色 因為他是中洋脊的軸線 大型地殼向兩邊分離開來"}, {"zh-tw": " And like a living organism, you tear it open, it bleeds its molten blood, rises up to heal that wound from the asthenosphere, hardens, forms new tissue and moves laterally. But no one had actually gone down into the actual site of the boundary of creation as we call it -- into the Rift Valley -- until a group of seven of us crawled in our little submarines in the summer of 1973, 1974 and were the first human beings to enter the Great Rift Valley.", "en": " 像是有機體一般，當你把它撕開 它將會流出古老的熔岩之血，來癒合這個傷口 岩漿來自軟流圈，硬化形成新的組織，向側面擴散 但是從來沒有人真正到下面去 到這我們稱作「創造的邊界」的地方 進入這個裂谷 -- 直到我們七人小組 在1973～1974年夏天爬近我們小小的潛水艇 而這是人類史上第一次抵達大裂谷"}, {"zh-tw": " We went down into the Rift Valley. This is all accurate except for one thing -- it's pitch black.", "en": " 我們下到這個裂谷 一切描述都十分正確，除了一件事情 -- 下面一片漆黑"}, {"zh-tw": " It's absolutely pitch black, because photons cannot reach the average depth of the ocean, which is 12,000 feet.
