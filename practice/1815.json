This study tracked 30,000 adultsin the United States for eight years, and they started by asking people, \"How much stress have youexperienced in the last year?\" They also asked, \"Do you believe that stressis harmful for your health?\" And then they used public death recordsto find out who died.", "en": " 讓我們從這個讓我重新思考 我對於壓力看法的研究報告說起吧 這個研究花了八年的時間追蹤美國的三萬名成年人 他們所做的就是先問受訪者 「過去一年裡你承受了多少的壓力？」 他們還會問： 「你是否相信壓力對你的健康有害？」 之後他們用戶政所的死亡記錄 去查出哪些人掛了"}, {"zh-tw": " Okay. Some bad news first.", "en": " 我先跟大家報告壞消息"}, {"zh-tw": " People who experienced a lot of stressin the previous year had a 43 percent increased risk of dying.

And this is one of the reasonsthat chronic stress is sometimes associatedwith cardiovascular disease.", "en": " 在一般的抗壓反應中 人的心搏率會升高 你的血管會像這樣收縮 這也是為什麼長期的壓力 被列為導致心血管疾病原因之一"}, {"zh-tw": " It's not really healthy to bein this state all the time.

I no longer wantto get rid of your stress.", "en": " 所以我身為健康心理學家的目標也因此而有所改變 我不再希望你去選擇擺脫壓力"}, {"zh-tw": " I want to make you better at stress. And we just did a little intervention.", "en": " 我希望你能更善於駕馭壓力 在這裡要打岔一下"}, {"zh-tw": " If you raised your hand and said you'd had a lot of stressin the last year, we could have saved your life, because hopefully the next timeyour heart is pounding from stress, you're going to remember this talk and you're going to think to yourself, this is my body helping merise to this challenge. And when you view stress in that way, your body believes you, and your stress responsebecomes healthier.", "en": " 如果剛剛你舉手說 過去一年裡你承受了很大的壓力 今天你的人生可能會就此改變 因為希望下次 當你的心臟因為感受到壓力而砰砰作響時 你會記得今天所聽到的 並會告訴自己 這是我的身體在幫助我面對這個挑戰 當你可以面對壓力可以這樣處之泰然 你的身體會聽命於你 這樣你面對壓力的反應機制就也會變得比較健康"}, {"zh-tw": " Now I said I have over a decadeof demonizing stress to redeem myself from, so we are going to doone more intervention. I want to tell you about one of the most under-appreciatedaspects of the stress response, and the idea is this: Stress makes you social.", "en": " 我剛說我過去十幾年的時間都把壓力妖魔化 所以我今天要好好彌補一下 現在我們要針對這點再重新思考 我要告訴大家關於抗壓反應最不為人知的一件事 我要告訴大家關於抗壓反應最不為人知的一件事 那就是 壓力會提升你的社交能力"}, {"zh-tw": " To understand this side of stress, we need to talk about a hormone, oxytocin, and I know oxytocin has already gottenas much hype as a hormone can get. It even has its own cute nickname,the cuddle hormone, because it's releasedwhen you hug someone.", "en": " 要想理解關於壓力的這一面 我們必須先來聊聊催產素這個賀爾蒙 我知道催產素作為賀爾蒙的一種 已經很能夠發揮它該有的功效 它甚至有個很可愛的小名：抱抱賀爾蒙 會取這名字是因為當你跟人擁抱時它就會被釋放出來"}, {"zh-tw": " But this is a very small partof what oxytocin is involved in. Oxytocin is a neuro-hormone.", "en": " 但這只是催產素功能的一小部分 催產素是一種神經賀爾蒙"}, {"zh-tw": " It fine-tunesyour brain's social instincts. It primes you to do things that strengthen close relationships.", "en": " 它可以在腦袋裡微調你的社交本能 預備你去做些事情 好增進你與他人的親密關係"}, {"zh-tw": " Oxytocin makes you crave physical contactwith your friends and family. It enhances your empathy.", "en": " 催產素也會讓你渴望與人有肢體接觸 包括跟朋友和家人 它也有助於增強同理心"}, {"zh-tw": " It even makes you more willingto help and support the people you care about. Some people have even suggestedwe should snort oxytocin...", "en": " 它甚至會讓你更願意去幫助那些 你所關心的人 還有人曾這麼建議 我們應該試著吸一點催產素"}, {"zh-tw": " to become more compassionate and caring. But here's what most peopledon't understand about oxytocin.", "en": " 好變成一個更有同情心、關心別人的人 但大家不了解關於催產素的是"}, {"zh-tw": " It's a stress hormone. Your pituitary gland pumps this stuff out as part of the stress response.", "en": " 它是一種隨壓力而生的賀爾蒙 當身體抗壓機制啓動時你的腦下垂體就會激生這種激素"}, {"zh-tw": " It's as much a partof your stress response as the adrenaline that makesyour heart pound. And when oxytocin is releasedin the stress response, it is motivating you to seek support.", "en": " 幾乎是抗壓的同時就會產生的 就好像腎上腺素會讓你的心臟加快速度一樣 而當催產素在抗壓過程中被釋放出來時 它會促使你去尋求幫助"}, {"zh-tw": " Your biological stress response is nudging you to tellsomeone how you feel, instead of bottling it up. Your stress response wantsto make sure you notice when someone elsein your life is struggling so that you can support each other.", "en": " 生理上的抗壓反應 會讓你想要向人傾訴你的感受 而不是獨自悶著不講 你的抗壓反應機制要確保你會注意到 身邊正在面對一些掙扎的人 好讓你們成為彼此的幫助"}, {"zh-tw": " When life is difficult, your stress response wants youto be surrounded by people who care about you.

Well, oxytocin doesn't only acton your brain.", "en": " 若遇到了困難你的抗壓反應機制 會讓你待在關心你的人身邊 那知道了這些可以怎麼幫助我們更健康地去面對壓力呢 催產素不光是對我們頭腦裡的想法有效"}, {"zh-tw": " It also acts on your body, and one of its main roles in your body is to protect your cardiovascular systemfrom the effects of stress. It's a natural anti-inflammatory.", "en": " 它也會在我們的身體裡有所作為 其中最主要一個角色就是 保護我們的心血管系統 不受到壓力的影響 它具有純天然的消炎功用"}, {"zh-tw": " It also helps your blood vesselsstay relaxed during stress. But my favorite effect on the bodyis actually on the heart.", "en": " 它也可以讓血管在感受到壓力的狀況下依然保持放鬆 但我個人最欣賞它能幫助我們的心臟"}, {"zh-tw": " Your heart has receptors for this hormone, and oxytocin helps heart cells regenerate and heal from any stress-induced damage. This stress hormonestrengthens your heart.", "en": " 你的心臟有一個針對這種賀爾蒙而設的接收器 催產素還能幫助心臟細胞再生 跟治療因壓力而造成的受損心細胞 這個壓力賀爾蒙能你的心臟更為強壯"}, {"zh-tw": " And the cool thingis that all of these physical benefits of oxytocin are enhancedby social contact and social support. So when you reach outto others under stress, either to seek supportor to help someone else, you release more of this hormone, your stress response becomes healthier, and you actually recoverfaster from stress.", "en": " 但更酷的是 我們剛所提各種催產素所能帶來生理上的益處 都能透過社交接觸或社會支持來強化 所以當你在受到壓力的情況下去與人接觸 不論是想要尋求幫助或是去幫助他人 你的身體都會更多釋放出這種賀爾蒙 於是你的抗壓機制會變得更為健康 你就也可以更快地從壓力當中解脫"}, {"zh-tw": " I find this amazing, that your stress responsehas a built-in mechanism for stress resilience, and that mechanism is human connection. I want to finish by telling youabout one more study.", "en": " 我發現這很奇妙 我們體內的抗壓反應有一個 有助於紓緩壓力的內建機制 而這個機制就是人與人之間的互動 最後結束前我想再跟大家分享一個研究報告"}, {"zh-tw": " And listen up, because this studycould also save a life.

But -- and I hope youare expecting a \"but\" by now -- but that wasn't true for everyone.", "en": " 好，我們先講壞消息 我們生命當中可能成為主要壓力來源的每一個事件 比方說財務困難或家庭風暴 都會讓死亡率上升30個百分點 但是...我希望大家都期待接下來要說的 但是這並不適用於每個人的狀況"}, {"zh-tw": " People who spent time caring for others showed absolutely no stress-relatedincrease in dying.

KM: Yeah, and one thingwe know for certain is that chasing meaningis better for your health than trying to avoid discomfort.
