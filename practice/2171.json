I didn't follow along with the crowd."}, {"zh-tw": "勇於嘗試各種奇裝異服或怪異髮型，也常常直言不諱，熱衷於社交。", "en": "I wasn't afraid to tryweird clothing trends or hairstyles. I was outspoken and extremely social."}, {"zh-tw": "這些照片是16年前我去倫敦交換那個學期拍攝的照片和明信片，從中也可以看出我並不在乎別人是否認為我怪異或另類。但就在 16 年前，我在倫敦的那一年，我意識到自己身上有些特別之處，而那從此改變了一切。", "en": "Even these pictures and postcards of my London semester abroad 16 years ago show that I obviously didn't careif I was perceived as weird or different. But that same year I was in London, 16 years ago, I realized something about myselfthat actually was somewhat unique, and that changed everything."}, {"zh-tw": "我竟變得和從前的自己判若兩人。我整天待在房間裡，不再出去社交。", "en": "I became the oppositeof who I thought I once was. I stayed in my roominstead of socializing."}, {"zh-tw": "我不再參與俱樂部和領導者培訓活動。我再也不想在眾人面前特立獨行了。", "en": "I stopped engaging in clubsand leadership activities. I didn't want to stand outin the crowd anymore."}, {"zh-tw": "我告訴自己，那是因為我在長大，在變得更加成熟，而並非因為我突然想要尋求他人的接受。我之前一直假定自己不需要被接受。", "en": "I told myself it was becauseI was growing up and maturing, not that I was suddenlylooking for acceptance. I had always assumed I was immuneto needing acceptance."}, {"zh-tw": "畢竟我還是挺脫俗的。可如今的我意識到，我發覺自己有些特立獨行的那一刻，正是我開始循規蹈矩、隱藏自我的那一刻。", "en": "After all, I was a bit unconventional. But I realize now that the moment I realizedsomething was different about me was the exact same momentthat I began conforming and hiding."}, {"zh-tw": "隱藏是一種漸進的習慣，一旦你開始隱藏自己，重新站出來展現自我、表達自我就會變得越來越艱難。事實上，即使是現在，當我跟別人探討這次演講的內容，我仍會編造出一個假故事來，而我甚至還隱瞞了要在 TED 演講的真相。", "en": "Hiding is a progressive habit, and once you start hiding, it becomes harder and harderto step forward and speak out. In fact, even now, when I was talking to peopleabout what this talk was about, I made up a cover story and I even hid the truthabout my TED Talk."}, {"zh-tw": "因此這次機會既合時宜，又令我感到害怕，我在十六年後重新回到這個城市，並選擇在這個舞台上，為隱藏自我劃下句點。16 年來我都在隱藏什麼呢？我是一個女同性戀。", "en": "So it is fitting and scary that I have returned to this city 16 years later and I have chosen this stageto finally stop hiding. What have I been hidingfor 16 years? I am a lesbian."}, {"zh-tw": "謝謝。一直以來我掙扎著將這幾個字說出口，因為我不想就此被它們定義。", "en": "Thank you. I've struggled to say those words, because I didn't wantto be defined by them."}, {"zh-tw": "過去每當我想要出櫃時，我都會暗想，我只想做我自己，那個獨一無二的莫甘娜，而不是「我的同性戀朋友莫甘娜」，或者「我的同性戀同事莫甘娜」。我就是我，莫甘娜。對於在座來自大都市的各位來說，這個問題或許根本不值一提。", "en": "Every time I would thinkabout coming out in the past, I would think to myself,but I just want to be known as Morgana, uniquely Morgana, but not \"my lesbian friend Morgana,\"or \"my gay coworker Morgana.\" Just Morgana. For those of you from largemetropolitan areas, this may not seem like a big deal to you."}, {"zh-tw": "或許這看起來甚是奇怪，我竟然將這個真相壓抑、隱藏了如此之久。但我被那份不被人接受的恐懼降服了。", "en": "It may seem strange that I have suppressed the truth and hidden this for so long. But I was paralyzed by my fearof not being accepted."}, {"zh-tw": "當然，有相同感受的並非我一人。2013 年德勤的一項研究發現，有相當多的人，多到令人驚訝，都在自己的身份方面有所隱藏。", "en": "And I'm not alone, of course. A 2013 Deloitte study foundthat a surprisingly large number of people hide aspects of their identity."}, {"zh-tw": "在這項研究調查的所有僱員中，有 61％ 的人表明他們曾改變自己某一方面的行為或外表，以適應工作環境。在所有同性戀和雙性戀僱員中，83％ 的人承認自己有過某些方面的改變，以在工作場合表現得「不那麼同性戀」。研究還發現，甚至在那些有多元化政策和融合性計劃的公司中，僱員們仍然難以在工作場合做自己，因為他們相信，順從和一致性對於他們長期的職業發展來說是至關重要的。", "en": "Of all the employees they surveyed, 61 percent reported changing an aspectof their behavior or their appearance in order to fit in at work. Of all the gay, lesbianand bisexual employees, 83 percent admitted to changingsome aspects of themselves so they would not appear at work \"too gay.\" The study found that even in companies with diversity policiesand inclusion programs, employees struggleto be themselves at work because they believe conformity is critical to their long-term career advancement."}, {"zh-tw": "儘管我驚訝於這麼多像我一樣的人都浪費了這麼多精力去試圖隱藏自己，但我還是恐懼的發現，我的沉默有著生死攸關的後果和長期的社會影響。十二年：壽命預期將會縮短十二年，如果你把那些生活在極端反同性戀和雙性戀的社區和相對接納同性戀的社區相比較的話。", "en": "And while I was surprisedthat so many people just like me waste so much energytrying to hide themselves, I was scared when I discoveredthat my silence has life-or-death consequencesand long-term social repercussions. Twelve years: the length by which life expectancy is shortened for gay, lesbian and bisexual peoplein highly anti-gay communities compared to accepting communities."}, {"zh-tw": "壽命預期縮短了整整十二年。今年，當我在同性戀雜誌“Advocate”上讀到這一條內容時，我意識到自己再也不能繼續沉默下去了。", "en": "Twelve years reduced life expectancy. When I read that in The Advocate magazine this year, I realized I could no longerafford to keep silent."}, {"zh-tw": "個人壓力和社會歧視的結合會產生致命的結果。研究發現，那些生活在反同性戀社區更有可能會出現心臟疾病、暴力和自殺。", "en": "The effects of personal stress andsocial stigmas are a deadly combination. The study found that gaysin anti-gay communities had higher rates of heart disease,violence and suicide."}, {"zh-tw": "我之前一直以為這是個私人問題，可如今卻意識到它有漣漪效應，影響著工作場合和延伸至社區，就像每一個與我類似的故事一樣。我選擇了隱藏自己，不去分享真實的自我，但這或許在無意間助長了相同的環境以及歧視的氛圍。", "en": "What I once thoughtwas simply a personal matter I realized had a ripple effect that went into the workplaceand out into the community for every story just like mine. My choice to hideand not share who I really am may have inadvertently contributedto this exact same environment and atmosphere of discrimination."}, {"zh-tw": "我曾一直告訴自己，沒有什麼理由告訴別人我是同性戀，但我的沉默有著社會影響的這一想法直到今年才閃入我的腦海，我一直以來都錯過了在家鄉堪薩斯州改變歧視氛圍的一個機會。在二月，堪薩斯州眾議院提出一項法案待表決，那將在原則上容許企業以宗教自由為理由，拒絕為同性戀者提供服務。", "en": "I'd always told myselfthere's no reason to share that I was gay, but the idea that my silencehas social consequences was really driven home this yearwhen I missed an opportunity to change the atmosphere of discriminationin my own home state of Kansas. In February, the Kansas House of Representatives brought up a bill for vote that would have essentiallyallowed businesses to use religious freedom as a reasonto deny gays services."}, {"zh-tw": "我的一個舊同事兼好友的父親在堪薩斯州的眾議院任職。他對這項法案投了贊成票，支持了這項容許企業拒絕為我提供服務的法案。", "en": "A former coworker and friend of mine has a father who servesin the Kansas House of Representatives. He voted in favor of the bill, in favor of a law that would allow businesses to not serve me."}, {"zh-tw": "而我的朋友對於同性戀、雙性戀、變性人、酷兒和對身份困惑的人是如何看待的呢？她的父親對這些人又是如何看待的呢？我不知道，因為我從未誠實地向他們坦白我是同性戀這一事實。而那讓我內心十分震撼。", "en": "How does my friend feel about lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender,queer and questioning people? How does her father feel? I don't know, because I was never honest with them about who I am. And that shakes me to the core."}, {"zh-tw": "如果我多年前就把真相告訴她，事情會怎麼樣呢？她會將我的經歷告訴她的父親嗎？我會最終改變他投下的那一票嗎？我永遠都不會知道了，而那令我意識到，自己沒有做出任何努力去試著帶來改變。多麼諷刺啊，我在人力資源部工作，這是一項致力於歡迎、聯繫並鼓勵僱員發展的職位，一項倡導應當在工作場合反映出社會多元化的職位，然而我沒有為倡導多元化出任何一份力。", "en": "What if I had told her my story years ago? Could she have told her father my experience? Could I have ultimatelyhelped change his vote? I will never know, and that made me realizeI had done nothing to try to make a difference. How ironic that I workin human resources, a profession that works to welcome, connect and encouragethe development of employees, a profession that advocatesthat the diversity of society should be reflected in the workplace, and yet I have done nothingto advocate for diversity."}, {"zh-tw": "當我一年前來到這家公司時，我暗想，這家公司有反歧視政策，會保護同性戀、雙性戀和變性人。他們對多元化的承諾已經在全球兼容並包項目中得到展現。", "en": "When I came to this company one year ago, I thought to myself, this company has anti-discrimination policies that protect gay, lesbian,bisexual and transgender people. Their commitment to diversity is evidentthrough their global inclusion programs."}, {"zh-tw": "當我走進這家公司的門時，我終於就可以出櫃了。可我並沒有。", "en": "When I walk through the doorsof this company, I will finally come out. But I didn't."}, {"zh-tw": "我並沒有好好利用這個機會，什麼都沒做。當我翻看 16 年前在倫敦那個學期的倫敦日誌和剪貼簿時，偶然發現一句來自托尼•莫里森的書「天堂」中的句子。「源自內心的恐懼比外界更多。」然後我在頁尾給自己寫下了：「記住這句話。」我確定當時是在為自己加油鼓勵，要出去走走，探索倫敦，但是我卻忽略了開始探索自己、悅納自己的需求。", "en": "Instead of taking advantageof the opportunity, I did nothing. When I was looking throughmy London journal and scrapbook from my London semesterabroad 16 years ago, I came across this modified quotefrom Toni Morrison's book, \"Paradise.\" \"There are more scary thingsinside than outside.\" And then I wrote a noteto myself at the bottom: \"Remember this.\" I'm sure I was trying to encourage myselfto get out and explore London, but the message I missed was the need to start exploring and embracing myself."}, {"zh-tw": "這麼多年後我才意識到的是我需要跨越的最大障礙永遠是我自己的恐懼和不安。我相信，直接面對自己內心的恐懼，我將能夠改變外在現實。", "en": "What I didn't realizeuntil all these years later is that the biggest obstaclesI will ever have to overcome are my own fears and insecurities. I believe that by facing my fears inside,I will be able to change reality outside."}, {"zh-tw": "今天，我做出決定，要揭露隱藏了太久太久的一部份自己。我希望這意味著我不會再次隱藏自己，我也希望透過今天在這裡出櫃，我能夠為改變那些駭人數據而做出點事情，並幫助其他覺得自己與衆不同的人更加做自己，並在職場和生活中獲得更多滿足。", "en": "I made a choice today to reveal a part of myselfthat I have hidden for too long. I hope that this meansI will never hide again, and I hope that by coming out today,I can do something to change the data and also to help others who feel differentbe more themselves and more fulfilled in both their professionaland personal lives."}, {"zh-tw": "謝謝大家。", "en": "Thank you."}], "title": "Morgana Bailey The Danger Of Hiding Who You Are"}
