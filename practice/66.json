I find this very interesting."}, {"zh-tw": "即便在一個晚宴上，你告訴大家你在教育界服務。坦白說你很少會參加那些晚宴啦，因為如果你在教育界工作沒人會邀請你去。", "en": "If you're at a dinner party, and you say you work in education -- Actually, you're not oftenat dinner parties, frankly. If you work in education,you're not asked."}, {"zh-tw": "詭異的是就算請你去一次，也不會再請你去第二次。但是如果你應邀出席了，你問同桌的某人，他在何處高就，然後說你自己在教育界工作。你立刻會看到他們臉上出現三條黑線，彷彿是說：", "en": "And you're never asked back, curiously.That's strange to me.

Like religion, and money and other things."}, {"zh-tw": "我個人對教育極感興趣，我猜我們都是這樣。大家都對教育興趣濃厚，其中部份原因是：教育可用來幫助我們掌握難以理解的未來。", "en": "So I have a big interest in education,and I think we all do.

They come in bearing gifts,gold, frankincense and myrrh. This really happened."}, {"zh-tw": "我們坐在那看戲時，這是真實發生的情況喲，我發現他們把獻禮的順序弄錯了，我們後來問兒子說：你不在意嗎？他說：這有什麼錯嗎？他們就換ㄧ下順序而已啊。故事繼續，這三個四歲小男孩走進耶穌的家，頭上包著毛巾布，他們把裝禮物的三個盒子放下，第一個小男孩說：我為你獻上黃金。第二個說：我為你獻上沒藥。第三個小男孩說：這是法蘭克送的(Frank sent this) [應為乳香-Frankincense，但小男孩不會發音]這些故事的共通處說明了小孩願意冒險。", "en": "We were sitting there and I thinkthey just went out of sequence, because we talked to the little boyafterward and we said, \"You OK with that?\" And he said,\"Yeah, why? Was that wrong?\" They just switched.

Am I right? They're notfrightened of being wrong."}, {"zh-tw": "當然，我不是說犯錯等於有創意。但是我們知道如果你沒有犯錯的心理準備，就永遠無法發揮獨創性。", "en": "I don't mean to say that being wrongis the same thing as being creative. What we do know is,if you're not prepared to be wrong, you'll never come upwith anything original -- if you're not prepared to be wrong."}, {"zh-tw": "如果你都不準備犯錯。當他們長大成人時，絕大部份孩子已經失去這項冒險的能力了。他們會變得害怕犯錯。", "en": "And by the time they get to be adults,most kids have lost that capacity. They have becomefrightened of being wrong."}, {"zh-tw": "順道一提，我們就是這樣經營公司企業的。我們懲罰錯誤。我們現在也以", "en": "And we run our companies like this. We stigmatize mistakes."}, {"zh-tw": "同樣方式在經營國家的教育制度，告訴孩子犯錯是最糟的事。而結果是我們教出一堆", "en": "And we're now runningnational education systems where mistakes are the worstthing you can make.

The problem is to remain an artistas we grow up."}, {"zh-tw": "我們不會越老越有創意，我們的成長背離創意。或者說，教育抹煞了我們的創造力。", "en": "I believe this passionately,that we don't grow into creativity, we grow out of it. Or rather, we get educated out of it."}, {"zh-tw": "為什麼呢？我以前住在英國埃文河畔的斯特拉福，莎士比亞的家鄉。我們五年前從那搬到美國洛杉磯。", "en": "So why is this? I lived in Stratford-on-Avonuntil about five years ago. In fact, we movedfrom Stratford to Los Angeles."}, {"zh-tw": "所以你可以了解，這是個多麼平順的轉變吧。事實上，我們那時住在斯特拉福外圍的斯尼特菲爾，那是", "en": "So you can imaginewhat a seamless transition that was. Actually, we lived in a placecalled Snitterfield, just outside Stratford, which is whereShakespeare's father was born."}, {"zh-tw": "莎翁父親出生的小鎮。這有沒有讓你聯想到什麼？我有。你從來沒想過莎士比亞也有爸爸吧？有嗎？想過嗎？因為你沒有想過莎士比亞曾經是個小孩，有嗎？七歲的莎士比亞？我從來沒想過。我是說，", "en": "Are you struck by a new thought? I was. You don't think of Shakespearehaving a father, do you? Do you? Because you don't thinkof Shakespeare being a child, do you? Shakespeare being seven? I never thought of it."}, {"zh-tw": "他曾經是七歲大。他曾經是某人英文課上的學生，難道不是嗎？想想那會有多討厭？「你得更用功」爸爸趕他上床睡覺，你知道的，跟莎士比亞說：上床睡覺，馬上！威廉．莎士比亞，「給我把鉛筆放下。而且別再用那種辭彙講話，大家都聽得霧煞煞。」反正呢，我們從斯特拉福搬到洛城，我事實上只是想談談我們的這個轉變。我的兒子並不想來。", "en": "I mean, he was seven at some point. He was in somebody'sEnglish class, wasn't he? How annoying would that be? \"Must try harder.\" Being sent to bed by his dad, you know,to Shakespeare, \"Go to bed, now!

I've got two kids;he's 21 now, my daughter's 16."}, {"zh-tw": "他不想來洛杉磯。他很喜歡這裡，但因為他在英國有女朋友。名叫莎拉，她是他人生至愛。", "en": "He didn't want to come to Los Angeles. He loved it, but he hada girlfriend in England."}, {"zh-tw": "他那時認識她一個月。告訴你，他們好像已經認識四年一樣，", "en": "This was the love of his life, Sarah. He'd known her for a month."}, {"zh-tw": "因為對 16 歲來說一個月是個很長的時間。無論如何，我兒子在飛機上很難過，他說：我再也找不到像莎拉這樣的女孩了。但坦白說，我們對此挺高興的，因為她是我們決定搬離英國的主要原因。", "en": "Mind you, they'd hadtheir fourth anniversary, because it's a long time when you're 16. He was really upset on the plane, he said, \"I'll never findanother girl like Sarah.\" And we were rather pleasedabout that, frankly -- Because she was the main reasonwe were leaving the country."}, {"zh-tw": "但當你來到美國或是在世界各地旅行時你會驚訝的發現，這地球上所有教育系統都有同樣的科目階級制度。不管你去哪裏，都是這樣。你以為會有所不同，但真的沒有差別。", "en": "But something strikes youwhen you move to America and travel around the world: Every education system on Earthhas the same hierarchy of subjects. Every one. Doesn't matter where you go."}, {"zh-tw": "最高階的學科是數學和語文，接著是人文社會科目，而藝術則是墊底的科目。到處都一樣。", "en": "You'd think it would beotherwise, but it isn't.

And in pretty much every system too,there's a hierarchy within the arts."}, {"zh-tw": "美術和音樂課程在學校永遠比戲劇和舞蹈課程更重要。這地球上沒有一個教育系統每天教授小孩們跳舞，就像教數學一樣。為什麼呢？為什麼不呢？我覺得這很重要。", "en": "Art and music are normallygiven a higher status in schools than drama and dance. There isn't an educationsystem on the planet that teaches dance everyday to children the way we teach them mathematics. Why? Why not? I think this is rather important."}, {"zh-tw": "我認為數學非常重要，但舞蹈也是。如果被允許，孩子們無時無刻不在跳舞，我們都是這樣。", "en": "I think math is veryimportant, but so is dance. Children dance all the timeif they're allowed to, we all do."}, {"zh-tw": "我們都有肢體，不是嗎？我錯過了什麼嗎？這一切背後的真相是，當小孩開始成長，我們的教育重心大量移至腰部以上。然後著重在頭部。", "en": "We all have bodies, don't we?Did I miss a meeting? Truthfully, what happens is,as children grow up, we start to educate them progressivelyfrom the waist up. And then we focus on their heads."}, {"zh-tw": "並且沒有左右均衡。如果你觀察這種教育制度，當個局外人，然後問：公立教育的目的是什麼呢？我想你的結論會是 — 如果你以結果論，誰能在這種制度下成功？誰是乖乖牌，從不犯錯？誰累積了最多嘉獎？誰是贏家？—我想你會得到這樣的結論，全球公立教育的目的只是", "en": "And slightly to one side. If you were to visiteducation, as an alien, and say \"What's it for, public education?\" I think you'd have to conclude,if you look at the output, who really succeeds by this, who does everything that they should, who gets all the browniepoints, who are the winners -- I think you'd have to concludethe whole purpose of public education throughout the world is to produce university professors."}, {"zh-tw": "製造大學教授，難道不是嗎？他們是那群高分畢業的人。我以前也是大學教授，所以你看吧！", "en": "Isn't it? They're the people who come out the top.

They're just a form of life, another form of life."}, {"zh-tw": "我會這樣說是因為，我對他們有深厚的感情。在我的經驗裏，教授們是有點難以理解的 —不是所有教授都這樣，但一般來說 — 他們活在自己腦袋中。", "en": "But they're rather curious, and I say thisout of affection for them. There's something curiousabout professors in my experience -- not all of them, but typically,they live in their heads."}, {"zh-tw": "他們都活在那兒，而且稍微偏向一邊。他們是脫離現實的，你知道，我沒有誇大。", "en": "They live up there,and slightly to one side. They're disembodied, you know,in a kind of literal way."}, {"zh-tw": "他們向下看著他們的身體，將其視為運輸頭部的一種交通工具，難道不是嗎？是將他們的腦袋帶往會議場所的一種方式。", "en": "They look upon their body as a formof transport for their heads.

It's a way of gettingtheir head to meetings."}, {"zh-tw": "如果你還需要這種離體經驗的真實證據，順道提一下，去參加一個由資深學者組成的需要住宿的研討會，然後在最後一個晚上，到大會附近的舞廳去。那你就會看到我所謂的證據，許多成年男女", "en": "If you want real evidenceof out-of-body experiences, get yourself along to a residentialconference of senior academics, and pop into the discothequeon the final night.

They all came into beingto meet the needs of industrialism."}, {"zh-tw": "所以這個階級制度根植在兩種概念上。首先，最有利工作的學科享有最高地位。所以當你還是個孩子的時候，", "en": "So the hierarchy is rooted on two ideas. Number one, that the most usefulsubjects for work are at the top."}, {"zh-tw": "在學校就被良性的指導不要去學某些東西，一些你喜歡的事物，因為就算你學了以後工作也用不上。對吧？別學音樂，因為你不會變成音樂家；別學美術，你不會變成藝術家。善意的建議 — 才怪，大錯特錯。這整個世界", "en": "So you wereprobably steered benignly away from things at school when youwere a kid, things you liked, on the grounds that you wouldnever get a job doing that.

Benign advice -- now, profoundly mistaken."}, {"zh-tw": "都被工業革命吞沒。第二，我們對智力的看法取決於學術能力的高底，因為大學院校以它們自己的經驗為藍本來設計教育制度。你仔細思考就會發現，", "en": "The whole worldis engulfed in a revolution. And the second is academic ability, which has really come to dominateour view of intelligence, because the universities designedthe system in their image."}, {"zh-tw": "全世界的公立教育系統都只是為進入大學之門鋪路。而結果造成許多有天份、有創意的、聰明的學生自我否定，因為他們的專長在學校不被重視，還可能因此受罰。", "en": "If you think of it, the whole systemof public education around the world is a protracted processof university entrance.

In the next 30 years, according to UNESCO, more people worldwide will be graduating through educationthan since the beginning of history."}, {"zh-tw": "更多的人，許多我們談過的因素結合造就了這項數字 —包括科技、對工作的轉型效應、人口組成和人口數大爆發。突然之間，文憑不值錢了。對吧？", "en": "More people, and it's the combinationof all the things we've talked about -- technology and its transformationeffect on work, and demography and the huge explosion in population. Suddenly, degrees aren't worth anything."}, {"zh-tw": "當我還是學生的時候，如果你有張大學文憑，你就有份工作。你要是沒工作，是因為你自己不想要。", "en": "Isn't that true? When I was a student,if you had a degree, you had a job.

We know three things about intelligence."}, {"zh-tw": "第一、多樣性。我們是以各種不同經驗來思考這個世界。我們可以用視覺、", "en": "One, it's diverse. We think about the world in all the waysthat we experience it."}, {"zh-tw": "聲音、肢體運動、抽象名詞和活動等各種方式來思考。", "en": "We think visually, we think in sound,we think kinesthetically.
