What is he doing? It's a grand idea of design -- a huge idea of design, common to all of the voices of religion and philosophy that emerged in the Classical period. What was going on then? They were trying to answer the question of what would human beings do now that they were no longer simply trying to survive? As the human race emerged from a prehistoric chaos, a confrontation with random, brutal nature, they suddenly had a moment to think -- and there was a lot to think about.", "en": " 讓我們想想柏拉圖試圖要做什麼 這是個有宏大想法的設計 與大部分的宗教和哲學相似 從經典時期誕生 那時發生了什麼事呢？ 他們試圖解答這個問題 人類若生活不只是單單為了求生存該做些什麼 當人類過了史前混亂期後 與隨機、兇殘的的內在產生了衝突 人們開始思考而有太說事情需要思考了"}, {"zh-tw": " All of a sudden, human existence needed an intent. Human life needed a reason.", "en": " 突然間，人類的存在需要目的性 人生在世是需要原因的"}, {"zh-tw": " Reality itself needed a designer.

Oh yeah. Today we don't confront the chaos of nature.", "en": " 是的，我們仍然與神爭戰 如今我們不須面對混亂的內在"}, {"zh-tw": " Today it is the chaos of humanity's impact on the Earth itself that we confront. This young discipline called design, I think, is in fact the emerging ethos formulating and then answering a very new question: What shall we do now in the face of the chaos that we have created? What shall we do? How shall we inscribe intent on all the objects we create, on all the circumstances we create, on all the places we change? The consequences of a planet with 7 billion people and counting.", "en": " 我們如今面對的混亂是人類對自然的影響 我認為，設計這個新興的領域 是新興的社會精神 組成並回答了一個新問題： 我們現在應該怎麼做 當我們面臨我們所創造的亂象 我們該怎麼做？ 我們如何將目的性 置入我們創造的所有物品 不管在任何我們造成的情況 或我們所改變的地點？ 70億甚至更多人口對地球所造成的後果"}, {"zh-tw": " That's the tune we're all covering today, all of us.
