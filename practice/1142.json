I'm going to talk about a new, old material that still continues to amaze us, and that might impact the way we think about material science, high technology -- and maybe, along the way, also do some stuff for medicine and for global health and help reforestation.", "en": " 謝謝 我非常高興來到這兒 我想談談一個新的老材料 而且, 我們持續在此材料的研究中感到驚奇 這可能會徹底改變我們對於 材料科學與高科技的想法 也或許 繼續下去 能為醫藥與全球健康盡心力 也能幫助再造林"}, {"zh-tw": " So that's kind of a bold statement. I'll tell you a little bit more.", "en": " 這是我們的大膽宣言 我會再多作說明的"}, {"zh-tw": " This material actually has some traits that make it seem almost too good to be true. It's sustainable; it's a sustainable material that is processed all in water and at room temperature -- and is biodegradable with a clock, so you can watch it dissolve instantaneously in a glass of water or have it stable for years.", "en": " 這材料的確會有著好到讓人難以想像的特徵 它絕對是對環境永續的 製程只在水中與室溫下進行 隨時間控制 它是生物可分解的 所以你能看著它很快的溶解於水中 或是能穩定存在好幾年"}, {"zh-tw": " It's edible; it's implantable in the human body without causing any immune response. It actually gets reintegrated in the body.", "en": " 是可食用 是可被植入人體 且不會造成排斥反應 它能在體內再組合"}, {"zh-tw": " And it's technological, so it can do things like microelectronics, and maybe photonics do. And the material looks something like this.", "en": " 它也是科技產品 所以它能製作成微電子元件 或是光電元件 這材料 長的像這樣"}, {"zh-tw": " In fact, this material you see is clear and transparent. The components of this material are just water and protein.", "en": " 實際上 這材料是透明的 成分就只是水和蛋白質"}, {"zh-tw": " So this material is silk. So it's kind of different from what we're used to thinking about silk.", "en": " 這材料是 絲 有點不同於 我們穿著的 絲"}, {"zh-tw": " So the question is, how do you reinvent something that has been around for five millennia? The process of discovery, generally, is inspired by nature. And so we marvel at silk worms -- the silk worm you see here spinning its fiber.", "en": " 所以問題是 怎麼能再創造發明這 已存在5000年的東西? 發現的過程 也是來自自然界的啟發 我們讚嘆蠶寶寶 這隻蠶正在吐出纖維"}, {"zh-tw": " The silk worm does a remarkable thing: it uses these two ingredients, protein and water, that are in its gland, to make a material that is exceptionally tough for protection -- so comparable to technical fibers like Kevlar. And so in the reverse engineering process that we know about, and that we're familiar with, for the textile industry, the textile industry goes and unwinds the cocoon and then weaves glamorous things.", "en": " 蠶寶寶作的神奇事是: 它用的成分就只是它腺體中的 蛋白質跟水 製造出具有保護作用的特別堅硬物質 相當於科技纖維 像是Kevlar (防彈纖維) 利用紡織界常用 也是我們都知道與 熟悉的 逆向工程研究: 紡織界解開蠶繭 再利用絲編出迷人織物"}, {"zh-tw": " We want to know how you go from water and protein to this liquid Kevlar, to this natural Kevlar. So the insight is how do you actually reverse engineer this and go from cocoon to gland and get water and protein that is your starting material.", "en": " 我們想知道的是 怎麼從水和蛋白質 產生液狀防彈纖維 就是這天然的防彈纖維 重要的是 你要如何執行逆向工程 從蠶繭到腺體分泌 才到水和蛋白質 也就是我們確定的初始物質"}, {"zh-tw": " And this is an insight that came, about two decades ago, from a person that I'm very fortunate to work with, David Kaplan. And so we get this starting material.", "en": " 這核心發現 來自於20年前 我有幸能共事過的一位同事 David Kaplan 我們有著初始物質"}, {"zh-tw": " And so this starting material is back to the basic building block. And then we use this to do a variety of things -- like, for example, this film.", "en": " 水和蛋白質 就是基本的構造 我們用這試著作出不同的東西 比如 像這個 薄膜"}, {"zh-tw": " And we take advantage of something that is very simple. The recipe to make those films is to take advantage of the fact that proteins are extremely smart at what they do.", "en": " 我門實際上利用蛋白質的優勢 這薄膜的製作方式 就是利用 蛋白質是非常聰明的"}, {"zh-tw": " They find their way to self-assemble. So the recipe is simple: you take the silk solution, you pour it, and you wait for the protein to self-assemble.", "en": " 他們能自己找到位置作組合堆疊 製作方法很簡單: 拿絲的溶液 倒出 等著蛋白質作自行結合堆疊"}, {"zh-tw": " And then you detach the protein and you get this film, as the proteins find each other as the water evaporates. But I mentioned that the film is also technological.", "en": " 撕下蛋白質就是這張薄膜 隨著溶液蒸發, 蛋白質會與其他蛋白質相觸 我剛剛強調這薄膜是具有科技性的"}, {"zh-tw": " And so what does that mean? It means that you can interface it with some of the things that are typical of technology, like microelectronics and nanoscale technology. And the image of the DVD here is just to illustrate a point that silk follows very subtle topographies of the surface, which means that it can replicate features on the nanoscale.", "en": " 怎麼說呢? 它可以成為 典型的科技事物 像是微電子元件 與 奈米級科技的介面 這照片上的DVD光碟片 只是要表示一個重點 絲能夠將就各式表面的微妙形狀 換句話說他們能複製奈米級的特性"}, {"zh-tw": " So it would be able to replicate the information that is on the DVD. And we can store information that's film with water and protein.", "en": " 也就能夠複製 DVD上的資訊 我們能儲存資訊在水和蛋白質作成的薄膜"}, {"zh-tw": " So we tried something out, and we wrote a message in a piece of silk, which is right here, and the message is over there. And much like in the DVD, you can read it out optically.", "en": " 這是我們的嘗試 留下些訊息在這塊絲上面 就是這塊絲 訊息在這邊 像DVD般 可以用光學方式讀取"}, {"zh-tw": " And this requires a stable hand, so this is why I decided to do it onstage in front of a thousand people. So let me see.", "en": " 這需要一雙穩定的手操作 也是我為什麼選擇要自己在台上呈現給數百人看 來吧!"}, {"zh-tw": " So as you see the film go in transparently through there, and then ... And the most remarkable feat is that my hand actually stayed still long enough to do that.", "en": " 薄膜大部分是透明的 再來... 最驚人的是 我的手真的能維持一定的穩定"}, {"zh-tw": " So once you have these attributes of this material, then you can do a lot of things. It's actually not limited to films.", "en": " 當你認識了關於這物質的 這些屬性 你可以利用絲 作出許多東西 不只是透明薄膜"}, {"zh-tw": " And so the material can assume a lot of formats. And then you go a little crazy, and so you do various optical components or you do microprism arrays, like the reflective tape that you have on your running shoes.", "en": " 這物質可以長成許多型式 然後可以瘋狂一點, 作出不同的光學零件 或是作出 微菱鏡陣列 像是在運動鞋上的反光條"}, {"zh-tw": " Or you can do beautiful things that, if the camera can capture, you can make. You can add a third dimensionality to the film.", "en": " 或作出美麗的東西 希望攝影機能看到這 你可以在薄膜上有三度空間的訊息"}, {"zh-tw": " And if the angle is right, you can actually see a hologram appear in this film of silk. But you can do other things.", "en": " 當角度對時 你可以看到一個全像顯示在這絲的薄膜上 也能做出其他東西"}, {"zh-tw": " You can imagine that then maybe you can use a pure protein to guide light, and so we've made optical fibers. But silk is versatile and it goes beyond optics.", "en": " 可以想像利用一個純蛋白質作光的傳導 所以我們做出光纖 絲是多樣的 能不只是光學用途"}, {"zh-tw": " And you can think of different formats. So for instance, if you're afraid of going to the doctor and getting stuck with a needle, we do microneedle arrays.", "en": " 也能想出些不同的型式 舉例說 怕上醫院打針 我們可以做出微針陣列"}, {"zh-tw": " What you see there on the screen is a human hair superimposed on the needle that's made of silk -- just to give you a sense of size. You can do bigger things.", "en": " 螢幕上顯示著一根人類頭髮 對比的是 用絲作成的針頭 給大家一個實際大小的感覺 也能做大一點的東西"}, {"zh-tw": " You can do gears and nuts and bolts -- that you can buy at Whole Foods. And the gears work in water as well.", "en": " 可以做齒輪 螺絲 螺母 以後可以在食品店買到 齒輪也能於水中運作"}, {"zh-tw": " So you think of alternative mechanical parts. And maybe you can use that liquid Kevlar if you need something strong to replace peripheral veins, for example, or maybe an entire bone.", "en": " 可以想成是另類的機構組件 可以用液態Kevlar 做出較硬的材料 以, 譬如, 取代周邊靜脈 或取代整跟骨頭"}, {"zh-tw": " And so you have here a little example of a small skull -- what we call mini Yorick. But you can do things like cups, for example, and so, if you add a little bit of gold, if you add a little bit of semiconductors you could do sensors that stick on the surfaces of foods.", "en": " 這裡有一些例子 小骷顱頭 我們稱它是迷你 Yorick (哈姆雷特中之人物) 舉例 也能做成杯子 或是加點金 加點半導體元件 能做出貼在食物上的感應器"}, {"zh-tw": " You can do electronic pieces that fold and wrap. Or if you're fashion forward, some silk LED tattoos.", "en": " 可以做出能被撓曲的 電子元件 或是你走在流行尖端, 可以是LED刺青"}, {"zh-tw": " So there's versatility, as you see, in the material formats, that you can do with silk. But there are still some unique traits.", "en": " 就如大家所見的 你可以用絲 在材料形式 作出不同的多樣性 但絲還是有些獨特的性質"}, {"zh-tw": " I mean, why would you want to do all these things for real? I mentioned it briefly at the beginning; the protein is biodegradable and biocompatible. And you see here a picture of a tissue section.", "en": " 我的意思是 為什麼要做出這些東西呢? 一開始我有簡單地說明過 蛋白質是可分解的以及不被排斥的 這裡是個人工器官的照片"}, {"zh-tw": " And so what does that mean, that it's biodegradable and biocompatible? You can implant it in the body without needing to retrieve what is implanted. Which means that all the devices that you've seen before and all the formats, in principle, can be implanted and disappear.", "en": " 絲具有生物可分解性或生物相容性 到底是什麼意思呢? 你可以將它植入體內又不必取出植入物 也就是說 之前看到的各形式 基本上都能被植入與取出"}, {"zh-tw": " And what you see there in that tissue section, in fact, is you see that reflector tape. So, much like you're seen at night by a car, then the idea is that you can see, if you illuminate tissue, you can see deeper parts of tissue because there is that reflective tape there that is made out of silk.", "en": " 那些器官部分 可以利用反光貼布的特性 像是被車燈照到反光 所以當光線照射到器官 就能因反光看到器官的更深部位 因為反光貼布是用絲所做的"}, {"zh-tw": " And you see there, it gets reintegrated in tissue. And reintegration in the human body is not the only thing, but reintegration in the environment is important.", "en": " 就可以整合到器官上 不只能應用到 器官植入人體 也能與環境保護結合"}, {"zh-tw": " So you have a clock, you have protein, and now a silk cup like this can be thrown away without guilt -- unlike the polystyrene cups that unfortunately fill our landfills everyday. It's edible, so you can do smart packaging around food that you can cook with the food.", "en": " 因蛋白質的成分 所以有著內部分解時鐘 一個絲作成的杯子 就能安心的丟棄 不像保利龍杯 每天成為垃圾堆積 它是可食的 所以可設計成聰明的食物包裝 也能與食物一起烹煮"}, {"zh-tw": " It doesn't taste good, so I'm going to need some help with that. But probably the most remarkable thing is that it comes full circle.", "en": " 只是吃起來口感不佳 我需要些這方面的協助 但最最神奇的事是它是天然循環的"}, {"zh-tw": " Silk, during its self-assembly process, acts like a cocoon for biological matter. And so if you change the recipe, and you add things when you pour -- so you add things to your liquid silk solution -- where these things are enzymes or antibodies or vaccines, the self-assembly process preserves the biological function of these dopants.", "en": " 絲 在自行組合時 生物行為上像是蠶繭 所以如果改變配方時 加點東西進去 在液狀絲溶液加點東西進去 通常就是酶 抗生素 或是 疫苗 自行組合時 會保持這些摻雜物的生物功能"}, {"zh-tw": " So it makes the materials environmentally active and interactive. So that screw that you thought about beforehand can actually be used to screw a bone together -- a fractured bone together -- and deliver drugs at the same, while your bone is healing, for example.", "en": " 所以可以做成環境活性的材料 或是會對環境反應的材料 所以剛剛看到的螺絲螺母 可以真的用來 將骨折的骨頭鎖在一起 又能在骨頭痊癒期間 比如, 同時釋放藥劑"}, {"zh-tw": " Or you could put drugs in your wallet and not in your fridge. So we've made a silk card with penicillin in it.", "en": " 會是變成能攜帶於皮夾中, 而非存於冰箱中的藥品 像這個絲作成的卡片 有著盤尼西林的成分"}, {"zh-tw": " And we stored penicillin at 60 degrees C, so 140 degrees Fahrenheit, for two months without loss of efficacy of the penicillin. And so that could be --- that could be potentially a good alternative to solar powered refrigerated camels.", "en": " 我們將盤尼西林存放在攝氏60度 也就是華氏140度 的環境 盤尼西林的藥效可維持整整兩個月 就可以 ... 就可以是背著太陽光電板以冷凍保存藥物的駱駝 的另一種解決方案"}, {"zh-tw": " And of course, there's no use in storage if you can't use [it]. And so there is this other unique material trait that these materials have, that they're programmably degradable.", "en": " 當然 最重要還是它應有的效果 所以這是它另一獨特的性質 它們能被設計成 可程式的分解"}, {"zh-tw": " And so what you see there is the difference. In the top, you have a film that has been programmed not to degrade, and in the bottom, a film that has been programmed to degrade in water.", "en": " 這裡顯現不同處 上方是設計成不分解 下方是設計成可水解"}, {"zh-tw": " And what you see is that the film on the bottom releases what is inside it. So it allows for the recovery of what we've stored before.", "en": " 看到的就是下方的薄膜 會釋出內容 所以我們能重新獲得當初儲存的物質"}, {"zh-tw": " And so this allows for a controlled delivery of drugs and for reintegration in the environment in all of these formats that you've seen. So the thread of discovery that we have really is a thread.", "en": " 所以就是一個可控制的藥物釋出 能再與週遭相結合 這些可以以上述的各種形式進行 所以我們發現的線索 也真的就是條線"}, {"zh-tw": " We're impassioned with this idea that whatever you want to do, whether you want to replace a vein or a bone, or maybe be more sustainable in microelectronics, perhaps drink a coffee in a cup and throw it away without guilt, maybe carry your drugs in your pocket, deliver them inside your body or deliver them across the desert, the answer may be in a thread of silk. Thank you.", "en": " 我們全力要做出你們能想出的東西 是血管 或是骨頭 或是具永續概念的微電子元件 或是可安心丟棄的 咖啡杯 或是可放在皮夾的藥 送入體內 或是 帶著越過沙漠 這一切就是在這條絲線上 謝謝!"}], "title": "Fiorenzo Omenetto Silk The Ancient Material Of The Future"}
