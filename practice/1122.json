I was born in Poland, now in the U.S.", "en": " 嗨，我的名字是Marcin 是個農夫，也是技術專家 我在波蘭出生，現在則在美國"}, {"zh-tw": " I started a group called Open Source Ecology. We've identified the 50 most important machines that we think it takes for modern life to exist -- things from tractors, bread ovens, circuit makers.", "en": " 我創立了一個名為Open Source Ecology的團隊 我們已經鑒別出維持現代生活運轉 所需五十種最重要的機器 諸如拖拉機 烤麵包機, 電路製造機"}, {"zh-tw": " Then we set out to create an open source, DIY, do it yourself version that anyone can build and maintain at a fraction of the cost. We call this the Global Village Construction Set.", "en": " 然後我們創設了資源共享, DIY, 自己動手做的版本 也就是任何人都能建造 並以少數花費來維護的機器 我們稱這為全球村建構集"}, {"zh-tw": " So let me tell you a story. So I finished my 20s with a Ph.D. in fusion energy, and I discovered I was useless.", "en": " 讓我來說個故事 在我二十歲時 獲得了融合能源的博士學位 我了解到我根本一無是處"}, {"zh-tw": " I had no practical skills. The world presented me with options, and I took them.", "en": " 我沒有任何的實質技能 世界給了我不同的選擇 我也接受了"}, {"zh-tw": " I guess you can call it the consumer lifestyle. So I started a farm in Missouri and learned about the economics of farming.", "en": " 我想你們可以說那是消費者的生活方式 所以我開始在密蘇里當起了農夫 並且學習經營農場的經濟學"}, {"zh-tw": " I bought a tractor -- then it broke. I paid to get it repaired -- then it broke again.", "en": " 我買了台拖拉機, 然後它壞了 我花了錢將它修復好 然後它又壞了"}, {"zh-tw": " Then pretty soon, I was broke too. I realized that the truly appropriate, low-cost tools that I needed to start a sustainable farm and settlement just didn't exist yet.", "en": " 沒多久 我也跟著沒錢了 我瞭解到 我需要真正合適, 低成本的工具 來打造出一個還不存在的 永續農場和住所"}, {"zh-tw": " I needed tools that were robust, modular, highly efficient and optimized, low-cost, made from local and recycled materials that would last a lifetime, not designed for obsolescence. I found that I would have to build them myself.", "en": " 我需要堅固的, 模組化的 高效率並最佳化 低成本, 以當地可回收材料做成的工具 而不只是設計用來作為過渡用 我瞭解到我必須自己建造它們"}, {"zh-tw": " So I did just that. And I tested them.", "en": " 而我也就這麼做了 並且測試它們"}, {"zh-tw": " And I found that industrial productivity can be achieved on a small scale. So then I published the 3D designs, schematics, instructional videos and budgets on a wiki.", "en": " 我瞭解到工業化的生產效率 是可以小量的達成 所以我在維基創立3D設計, 解析圖, 操作指南影片 和預算"}, {"zh-tw": " Then contributors from all over the world began showing up, prototyping new machines during dedicated project visits. So far, we have prototyped eight of the 50 machines.", "en": " 而之後世界各地的贊助者開始出現 並在造訪我們的計畫中 創造多種新的原創機器 到目前為止, 我們的五十種機器中有八項是原創設計"}, {"zh-tw": " And now the project is beginning to grow on its own. We know that open source has succeeded with tools for managing knowledge and creativity.", "en": " 而現在這個計畫 正開始自我茁壯 我們知道資源共享是藉由軟體的使用 來駕馭知識與創意而成功"}, {"zh-tw": " And the same is starting to happen with hardware too. We're focusing on hardware because it is hardware that can change people's lives in such tangible material ways.", "en": " 而相同的事正開始發生在硬體上 我們著眼在硬體 因為正是硬體設施這樣實質形體的事物 能改變人的生活"}, {"zh-tw": " If we can lower the barriers to farming, building, manufacturing, then we can unleash just massive amounts of human potential. That's not only in the developing world.", "en": " 如果我們能降低耕作, 建築, 製造的成本 我們就能釋放出人類大量的潛能 這不僅僅只發生在開發中國家"}, {"zh-tw": " Our tools are being made for the American farmer, builder, entrepreneur, maker. We've seen lots of excitement from these people, who can now start a construction business, parts manufacturing, organic CSA or just selling power back to the grid.", "en": " 美國的農夫, 建築業者, 企業家, 生產者 也建構出我們的機器 我們看見了這些人 因能開創一個建構事業 或者是製造業 有機 CSA 或僅僅販售這些機器而感到開心興奮"}, {"zh-tw": " Our goal is a repository of published designs so clear, so complete, that a single burned DVD is effectively a civilization starter kit.

A greater distribution of the means of production, environmentally sound supply chains, and a newly relevant DIY maker culture can hope to transcend artificial scarcity.", "en": " 如果這點子真的管用 那它的影響一定十分重大 製造的意義將能有更好的分佈, 聽起來更環保的供應鏈, 和一個全新價值的DIY製造者文化 期望能優於 過往過度工業化的製程"}, {"zh-tw": " We're exploring the limits of what we all can do to make a better world with open hardware technology. Thank you.", "en": " 我們正探索著 藉由硬體科技資源共享 使世界更好的極限 謝謝 (鼓掌)"}], "title": "Marcin Jakubowski"}
