The most important thing to knowabout prehistoric humans is that they were unimportant. Their impact on the world was notmuch greater than that of jellyfish or fireflies or woodpeckers.", "en": " 七萬年前，我們的先祖不過是各種動物中的一種。 當你想到原人時，最重要的是 他們一點也不重要。 他們對世界的影響力 和水母、螢火蟲、啄木鳥差別不大。"}, {"zh-tw": " Today, in contrast,we control this planet. And the question is: How did we come from there to here? How did we turn ourselvesfrom insignificant apes, minding their own businessin a corner of Africa, into the rulers of planet Earth? Usually, we look for the differencebetween us and all the other animals on the individual level.", "en": " 今天，我們卻變成地球的霸主。 所以問題是： 我們是怎麼走到這一步的？ 我們是如何從毫不起眼的人猿， 在非洲的角落自生自滅， 搖身一變成為地球霸主的？ 通常我們會在個體差異上 檢視我們與其它動物的分別，"}, {"zh-tw": " We want to believe -- I want to believe -- that there is something special about me, about my body, about my brain, that makes me so superiorto a dog or a pig, or a chimpanzee. But the truth is that,on the individual level, I'm embarrassingly similarto a chimpanzee.", "en": " 我們想信 － 我想要相信 我們與眾不同， 我的身體，我的大腦， 讓我遠比狗、豬，或是黒猩猩優越。 但事實是，就個體差異來說 我和黑猩猩驚人的相似。"}, {"zh-tw": " And if you take me and a chimpanzeeand put us together on some lonely island, and we had to struggle for survivalto see who survives better, I would definitely place my beton the chimpanzee, not on myself. And this is not somethingwrong with me personally.", "en": " 如果你把我和一頭黒猩猩置於同一孤島 看我們之中誰能存活的更好， 我會把籌碼放在黒猩猩身上，而不是我自己。 這不是因為我個人的缺陷，"}, {"zh-tw": " I guess if they took almost any oneof you, and placed you alone with a chimpanzee on some island, the chimpanzee would do much better. The real difference between humansand all other animals is not on the individual level; it's on the collective level.", "en": " 我想如果有人把你們其中任何人 與一頭黒猩猩一起放在孤島上， 黑猩猩絕對會生存的更好。 真正讓人類與其它動物分別開來的特質 不是個體的， 而是群體的。"}, {"zh-tw": " Humans control the planetbecause they are the only animals that can cooperate both flexiblyand in very large numbers.

There is basically just one wayin which a beehive can function.", "en": " 牠們的合作方式是固定的。 蜂窩總是用同一種方式運作。"}, {"zh-tw": " And if there's a new opportunityor a new danger, the bees cannot reinventthe social system overnight.

What kind of chimpanzee are you? Are you a nice chimpanzee? Are you an evil chimpanzee? Are you trustworthy? If I don't know you, how can Icooperate with you?

In contrast, humans normallygather there in tens of thousands, and what we get is not chaos, usually.", "en": " 那個景象將有多瘋狂。 相對的，成千上萬的人時常一同在那， 也通常不會陷入混亂。"}, {"zh-tw": " What we get is extremely sophisticatedand effective networks of cooperation.

Chimpanzees don't have slaughterhousesand prisons and concentration camps.", "en": " 監獄是一種合作系統， 屠宰場是一種合作系統， 集中營是一種合作系統， 黒猩猩沒有屠宰場、監獄、或集中營。"}, {"zh-tw": " Now suppose I've managedto convince you perhaps that yes, we control the world because we cancooperate flexibly in large numbers. The next question that immediately arises in the mind of an inquisitive listener is: How, exactly, do we do it? What enables us alone, of all the animals,to cooperate in such a way? The answer is our imagination.", "en": " 現在或許我已經說服你 我們的確掌控了世界，因為我們能大規模靈活合作。 下一個問題隨之而來， 好奇的聽眾心裡想： 我們是怎麼做到的？ 在所有動物中，為什麼只有我們這樣合作？ 答案是我們的想像力。"}, {"zh-tw": " We can cooperate flexiblywith countless numbers of strangers, because we alone, of allthe animals on the planet, can create and believe fictions,fictional stories.

This is something only humans can do.", "en": " 人可以說：「看啊！雲上有神！ 如果你不聽從命令， 你死後，神會懲罰你下地獄。」 如果你們都相信我發明的故事， 就會依循一樣的基準、法則、價值觀， 你們就會合作。 這件事只有人類做得到。"}, {"zh-tw": " You can never convince a chimpanzeeto give you a banana by promising him, \"... after you die,you'll go to chimpanzee heaven ...\" \"... and you'll receive lots and lotsof bananas for your good deeds.

Now you may find it acceptable that yes, in the religious field, humans cooperateby believing in the same fictions.", "en": " 只有人類會相信這種故事。 這就是我們稱霸世界， 而黑猩猩卻淪落到動物園和實驗室的原因。 或許你同意， 的確，在宗教領域， 人們因為信仰相同而彼此合作，"}, {"zh-tw": " Millions of people come togetherto build a cathedral or a mosque or fight in a crusade or a jihad, becausethey all believe in the same stories about God and heaven and hell. But what I want to emphasizeis that exactly the same mechanism underlies all other formsof mass-scale human cooperation, not only in the religious field.", "en": " 百萬人同心合力建造教堂、清真寺， 奮身投入各種聖戰， 全都是因為對於神、天堂與地獄有著相同的信仰。 但我想說的是同樣的運作機制， 存在於所有人類的大規模合作， 不限於宗教領域。"}, {"zh-tw": " Take, for example, the legal field. Most legal systems today in the worldare based on a belief in human rights.", "en": " 譬如，法治概念。 現在世界上大部分的法律，都以人權為基礎。"}, {"zh-tw": " But what are human rights? Human rights, just like God and heaven,are just a story that we've invented.

The same is true of the political field.", "en": " 這些故事可能很正面、很好， 但仍然是我們虛構的。 政治領域也一樣。"}, {"zh-tw": " The most important factorsin modern politics are states and nations.

You can see it, you can touch it,you can even smell it.", "en": " 山嶽才是客觀事實。 你看得到，摸得到，甚至聞得到。"}, {"zh-tw": " But a nation or a state, like Israel or Iran or France or Germany, this is just a story that we've invented and became extremely attached to. The same is true of the economic field.", "en": " 但國族， 像以色列、伊朗、法國或德國， 只是我們創造的故事， 並且變得深信不疑。 經濟領域也一樣。"}, {"zh-tw": " The most important actors todayin the global economy are companies and corporations. Many of you today, perhaps, workfor a corporation, like Google or Toyota or McDonald's.", "en": " 今日全球經濟的主角 是公司和企業。 你們當中可能有許多人為企業工作， 像谷歌或豐田汽車或麥當勞。"}, {"zh-tw": " What exactly are these things? They are what lawyers call legal fictions.

Chimpanzees trade, of course: \"Yes, you give me a coconut,I'll give you a banana.\" That can work.", "en": " 黑猩猩可辦不到。 當然，黑猩猩也懂得交換： 「你給我一顆椰子，我給你一根香蕉」 也行。"}, {"zh-tw": " But, you give mea worthless piece of paper and you except me to give you a banana? No way! What do you think I am, a human? Money, in fact, isthe most successful story ever invented and told by humans, because it is the only storyeverybody believes.

He hated American politicsand American religion and American culture, but he had no objectionto American dollars.", "en": " 就像賓拉登。 他憎恨美國的政策和信仰， 美國文化， 但他完全不排斥美金，"}, {"zh-tw": " He was quite fond of them, actually.
