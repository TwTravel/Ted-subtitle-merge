Even nuclear seems to bemaking a comeback.", "en": " 德國有時能有一半能源來自太陽能， 印度現正籌備建設的太陽能發電裝置數量， 比加州在2022年將建成的 還要多10倍。 甚至核能似乎都捲土重來了。"}, {"zh-tw": " Bill Gates is in Chinaworking with engineers, there's 40 different companiesthat are working together to try to race to build the firstreactor that runs on waste, that can't melt down and is cheaper than coal.

That was the question we wanted to know, so my colleagues and I decidedto take a deep dive into the data.", "en": " 比爾·蓋茨在中國與工程師們合作， 40家公司一起合作 試圖爭先建造第一個依靠核廢料運行的反應堆， 它的爐心不會熔化， 而且比煤更便宜。 所以，你可能會想問： 那麼全球暖化問題 真的比任何人想像中都要容易解決嗎？ 這是我們想知道的問題， 所以我和同事決定深入研究數據。"}, {"zh-tw": " We were a little skeptical of some parts of the clean energy revolution story, but what we found really surprised us. The first thing is that cleanenergy has been increasing.", "en": " 我們對潔淨能源革命的故事 其中有某些地方有點疑問。 但是研究的結果卻讓我們感到驚訝。 第一件事就是潔淨能源的使用一直在增加。"}, {"zh-tw": " This is electricity from clean energysources over the last 20 years.

When you combine all the electricityfrom solar and wind, you see it actually barely makes uphalf of the decline from nuclear.", "en": " 但數據顯示並非如此。 當你把所有太陽和風能相加， 你看它實際上只能勉強彌補核能下降值的一半。"}, {"zh-tw": " Let's take a closer lookin the United States.

There's really three things. There's the safetyof the plants themselves -- the fears that they're goingto melt down and cause damage; there's the waste from them; and there's the association with weapons.", "en": " 那麼，是什麼讓我們恐懼？ 有三件確定的事： 核電廠本身的安全 - 害怕爐心熔化，造成損壞。 其次是核電廠的核廢料。 最後還有與核武器的關聯。"}, {"zh-tw": " And I think, understandably, engineers look at those concernsand look for technological fixes. That's why Bill Gates is in Chinadeveloping advanced reactors.", "en": " 我認為，這是可以理解的， 工程師們專注於這些疑慮，並在技術上加以修正。 這就是為什麼比爾·蓋茨在中國開發先進的反應器。"}, {"zh-tw": " That's why 40 different entrepreneursare working on this problem.

Because we're in a little bitof a climate crisis right now. And your cities are reallypolluted, by the way.\" And they responded back, they were like, \"I'm not sure what you've heardabout our thorium program, but we don't have a third of our budget, and your department of energyhasn't been particularly forthcoming with all that data you guyshave on testing reactors.\" And I said, \"Well, I've got an idea.", "en": " 他們介紹完了，談到計畫時程時， 他們說： “我們不得不將釷熔鹽反應器 上市的時間訂於 2040年。\" 我當時就像這樣--“啥？” 我看了看我的同事，然後就像這樣， “對不起 - “ 你們可以稍微加速一點嗎？ 因為我們現在有一點氣候危機， 而同時你們的城市污染真的是嚴重。\" 他們回應道，他們也想， “我不知道你聽說過我們的什麼釷計劃， 但我們連三分之一的預算都沒有， 你們能源部好像也不是很主動 公開你們測試的反應器數據。“ 我說：“嗯，我有一個想法。"}, {"zh-tw": " You know how you've got 10 yearswhere you're demonstrating that reactor? Let's just skip that part, and let's just go rightto commercializing it.

There's a reactor that's coming onlinenow, they're starting to sell it.", "en": " 你知道10年你們在哪裡展示這反應器？ 讓我們跳過這一部分， 直接商業化。 這將節省時間和金錢。“ 工程師看著我，說： “讓我問你一個問題： 你會買一輛從來沒有展示過的汽車嗎？“ 那麼，關於其他的反應器呢？ 也就說即將上線的反應器，現在他們已經開始出售了。"}, {"zh-tw": " It's a high-temperature gas reactor. It can't melt down.", "en": " 這是一個高溫氣體反應器。 它不會熔毀。"}, {"zh-tw": " But it's really big and bulky,that's part of the safety, and nobody thinksit's going to ever get cheaper than the reactors that we have.

The truth is, there's real questions about how muchof that we're going to do.", "en": " 你要冒著實際上製造更多的核廢料的風險， 大多數人認為如果你把 處理廢料的部份加上去， 整個機器將更加而昂貴不少， 它只是增加另一個複雜的步驟。 事實是， 有多少真正的問題是我們要處理的。"}, {"zh-tw": " I mean, we went to India and askedabout the nuclear program. The government saidbefore the Paris climate talks that they were going to do somethinglike 30 new nuclear plants.", "en": " 我的意思是，我們去了印度，並要求看核能計劃。 政府表示，巴黎的氣候談判之前 他們打算做些什麼，例如蓋30座新的核電廠。"}, {"zh-tw": " But when we got thereand interviewed people and even looked at the internal documents, they're now sayingthey're going to do about five. And in most of the world,especially the rich world, they're not talkingabout building new reactors.", "en": " 但是，當我們到了那裡並採訪相關人士 甚至看了看內部文件， 他們現在說大約要蓋5座。 而在世界上大多數國家，尤其是有錢人的世界， 他們不要建立新的核反應器。"}, {"zh-tw": " We're actually talkingabout taking reactors down before their lifetimes are over. Germany's actually pressuringits neighbors to do that.", "en": " 我們實際上是在談論 關於在使用期限前將其除役。 德國實際上施壓他的鄰居這樣做。"}, {"zh-tw": " I mentioned the United States -- we could lose half of our reactorsover the next 15 years, which would wipe out 40 percentof the emissions reductions we're supposed to getunder the Clean Power Plan. Of course, in Japan, they tookall their nuclear plants offline, replaced them with coal,natural gas, oil burning, and they're only expected to bringonline about a third to two-thirds.", "en": " 我提到美國 - 在接下來的15年裡，我們可能會關掉一半的反應器。 這將使碳排放減少40％。 前提是得全由潔淨能源取代才行。 當然，在日本，他們將所有的核電廠下線， 用煤、天然氣及石油取而代之， 而他們只預期將約三分之一到三分之二的反應器再上線。"}, {"zh-tw": " So when we went through the numbers, and just added that up -- how much nuclear do we seeChina and India bringing online over the next 15 years, how much do we see at riskof being taken offline -- this was the most startling finding. What we found is thatthe world is actually at risk of losing four times more clean energythan we lost over the last 10 years.", "en": " 所以，當我們核算一下數字， 給它們算了算 - 接下來的15年裡， 中國和印度將有多少核電廠上線， 有多少是有被下線的風險 。 這是最令人吃驚的發現。 我們發現的是，世界其實是有風險可能失去 4倍於過去10年減少量的潔淨能源。"}, {"zh-tw": " In other words: we're notin a clean energy revolution; we're in a clean energy crisis. So it's understandable that engineerswould look for a technical fix to the fears that people have of nuclear.", "en": " 換句話說：我們不處於潔淨能源革命， 而是在潔淨能源危機中。 所以工程師將尋求技術性修正 人們對核能的疑慮是可以理解的。"}, {"zh-tw": " But when you considerthat these are big challenges to do, that they're going to takea long time to solve, there's this other issue, which is: Are those technical fixesreally going to solve people's fears? Let's take safety. You know, despite what people think, it's hard to figure out howto make nuclear power much safer.", "en": " 但是，當你考慮這些都是巨大的挑戰， 他們要花費很長的時間來解決， 還有這另一個問題，這就是： 那些技術性修正真的能解決人們的恐慌、 使我們感到安全嗎？ 要知道，儘管人們這樣想， 還是很難弄清楚如何才能使核電更加安全。"}, {"zh-tw": " I mean, every medicaljournal that looks at it -- this is the most recent studyfrom the British journal, \"Lancet,\" one of the most respectedjournals in the world -- nuclear is the safest wayto make reliable power. Everybody's scared of the accidents.", "en": " 我的意思是，每本探討這個問題的醫學期刊- 這是英國醫學期刊“柳葉刀”最近的研究。 世上最受尊敬的期刊之一 - 核能是最安全可靠的能源。 發生事故時，每個人都嚇壞了。"}, {"zh-tw": " So you go look at the accident data -- Fukushima, Chernobyl -- the World Health Organizationfinds the same thing: the vast majority of harmis caused by people panicking, and they're panickingbecause they're afraid. In other words, the harm that's causedisn't actually caused by the machines or the radiation.", "en": " 所以，你去看看事故的數據 - 福島、車諾比爾 - 世界衛生組織發現同樣的事情： 絕大多數的危害是人們恐慌造成的， 他們恐慌，因為他們害怕。 換一種說法， 造成損害的不是實際的機器 或輻射。"}, {"zh-tw": " It's caused by our fears. And what about the waste? Everyone worries about the waste.", "en": " 它是恐懼。 那核廢料呢？ 每個人都擔心核廢料。"}, {"zh-tw": " Well, the interestingthing about the waste is how little of it there is. This is just from one plant.", "en": " 好了，關於核廢料有趣的是： 它有多麼小。 這是從一個核電廠運出來的廢料。"}, {"zh-tw": " If you take all the nuclear wastewe've ever made in the United States, put it on a football field, stacked it up, it would only reach 20 feet high.

By contrast, the waste that we don'tcontrol from energy production -- we call it \"pollution,\" and it killsseven million people a year, and it's threatening very seriouslevels of global warming.", "en": " 就只是這樣而已。 相較之下，能源生產中不受控制的廢料 - 我們稱之為“污染”，一年殺死七百萬人。 並造成全球暖化的嚴重威脅。"}, {"zh-tw": " And the truth is that even if we getgood at using that waste as fuel, there's always going to besome fuel left over.

Maybe the most surprising thingis that we can't find any examples of countries that have nuclear power and then, \"Oh!\" decide to go get a weapon. In fact, it works the opposite.", "en": " 那麼，核電與核武的關聯呢？ 也許最令人吃驚的事情是， 我們找不到任何的例子，有擁有核電的國家表示， “哦！”，決定把核廢料變核武。 事實上，它的工作原理是相反的。"}, {"zh-tw": " What we find is the only way we know how to get rid large numbersof nuclear weapons is by using the plutonium in the warheads as fuel in our nuclear power plants. And so, if you are wanting to getthe world rid of nuclear weapons, then we're going to needa lot more nuclear power.", "en": " 我們發現就所知能擺脫大量核武的唯一途徑， 就是將核武中的鈽彈頭 做為核電廠的燃料。 所以，如果你讓世界擺脫核武器， 那麼我們會需要更大量的核電。"}, {"zh-tw": " As I was leaving China, the engineer that brought Bill Gates therekind of pulled me aside, and he said, \"You know, Michael,I appreciate your interest in all the different nuclearsupply technologies, but there's this more basic issue, which is that there's just notenough global demand.
