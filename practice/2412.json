And this is a really rare phenomenon.", "en": " 這些就像種子一樣可以禁得起極端環境條件。 這是非常罕見的現象。"}, {"zh-tw": " There are only 135 floweringplant species that can do this. I'm going to show you a video of the resurrection processof these three species in that order.", "en": " 只有 135 種開花植物可以做到這點。 我要給大家看一段影片， 是這三種植物的復甦過程， 按圖片上的順序播放。"}, {"zh-tw": " And at the bottom, there's a time axisso you can see how quickly it happens. Pretty amazing, huh? So I've spent the last 21 yearstrying to understand how they do this.", "en": " 影片下方有時間軸， 大家可以看到過程有多快。 很驚人吧？ 我過去 21 年都在試著瞭解它們如何辦到這一點。"}, {"zh-tw": " How do these plants dry without dying? And I work on a varietyof different resurrection plants, shown here in the hydrated and dry states, for a number of reasons. One of them is that eachof these plants serves as a model for a crop that I'd liketo make drought-tolerant.", "en": " 這些植物如何能乾枯卻不死亡？ 我研究很多種不同的復甦植物， 這裡看到的是含水及乾燥狀態， 有幾個原因。 其中一個是這裡的每種植物都充作研究範本， 以研究我想培育的耐旱作物。"}, {"zh-tw": " So on the extreme top left,for example, is a grass, it's called Eragrostis nindensis, it's got a close relativecalled Eragrostis tef -- a lot of you might know it as \"teff\" -- it's a staple food in Ethiopia, it's gluten-free, and it's something we would liketo make drought-tolerant. The other reason for lookingat a number of plants, is that, at least initially, I wanted to find out:do they do the same thing? Do they all use the same mechanisms to be able to loseall that water and not die? So I undertook what we calla systems biology approach in order to geta comprehensive understanding of desiccation tolerance, in which we look at everything from the molecular to the whole plant,ecophysiological level.", "en": " 舉個例子，左上方是一種草， 畫眉草屬植物， 它有個近親叫衣索比亞畫眉草， 很多人叫它苔麩， 這是衣索比亞國民食物， 無麩質， 我們想讓它耐旱。 另一個原因要看各種植物， 就是，至少起初是這樣， 我想知道：是不是每種植物都有同樣的反應？ 是不是都用同一種機制 讓自己失水卻不至於死？ 所以我著手用我們稱為系統生物學的方法， 以期對耐旱性能有完整的瞭解， 我們看所有的東西， 從分子到全株、生理生態學階層都看。"}, {"zh-tw": " For example we look at things like changes in the plant anatomyas they dried out and their ultrastructure. We look at the transcriptome,which is just a term for a technology in which we look at the genes that are switched on or off,in response to drying.", "en": " 舉個例子，我們會看像是 植物在變乾的過程中，在解剖學上經歷的變化 及其超微結構。 我們會看轉錄組，這只是一個技術名詞， 基本上就是要看哪些基因 在因應乾燥過程中會被開啟或關閉。"}, {"zh-tw": " Most genes will code for proteins,so we look at the proteome. What are the proteins madein response to drying? Some proteins would code for enzymeswhich make metabolites, so we look at the metabolome.", "en": " 大部分的基因都製造蛋白質，所以我們也看蛋白質組。 為了因應乾燥，會製造出哪些蛋白質？ 有些蛋白質是為了合成酵素，產生代謝物， 所以我們也看代謝物組。"}, {"zh-tw": " Now, this is importantbecause plants are stuck in the ground. They use what I calla highly tuned chemical arsenal to protect themselves from allthe stresses of their environment.", "en": " 這很重要，因為植物牢牢釘在地上。 它們用我稱為非常精準的化學兵工廠 來保護自己不受環境逆境影響。"}, {"zh-tw": " So it's important that we look at the chemical changesinvolved in drying. And at the last studythat we do at the molecular level, we look at the lipidome -- the lipid changes in response to drying.", "en": " 所以去看死亡過程的化學變化就很重要。 我們最近的研究在看分子層次， 我們看的是脂類組， 脂質如何變化以因應死亡。"}, {"zh-tw": " And that's also important because all biological membranesare made of lipids. They're held as membranesbecause they're in water.", "en": " 這也很重要， 因為所有的生物膜都由脂質組成。 它們能形成薄膜是因為在水中。"}, {"zh-tw": " Take away the water,those membranes fall apart. Lipids also act as signalsto turn on genes.", "en": " 把水拿掉，薄膜就會解體。 脂質還作為打開基因的信號。"}, {"zh-tw": " Then we use physiologicaland biochemical studies to try and understandthe function of the putative protectants that we've actually discoveredin our other studies. And then use all of thatto try and understand how the plant copeswith its natural environment.", "en": " 然後我們用生理及生化研究 試著瞭解我們假設的保護因子的功用， 這些因子是我們在其它研究中發現的。 然後用所有研究結果去試著瞭解 植物如何適應自然環境。"}, {"zh-tw": " I've always had the philosophy thatI needed a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms of desiccation tolerance in order to make a meaningful suggestionfor a biotic application. I'm sure some of you are thinking, \"By biotic application, does she mean she's going to makegenetically modified crops?\" And the answer to that question is: depends on your definitionof genetic modification.", "en": " 我一直有套哲理，就是我必須 對耐旱性機制有全盤瞭解， 才能對其生物應用提出有意義的建議。 我很確信有些人正在想： 「生物應用？ 她是說她要培育基改作物？」 這個問題的答案是： 要看你怎麼定義基改。"}, {"zh-tw": " All of the crops that we eat today,wheat, rice and maize, are highly genetically modifiedfrom their ancestors, but we don't consider them GM because they're being producedby conventional breeding. If you mean, am I going to putresurrection plant genes into crops, your answer is yes.", "en": " 我們今天吃的作物，小麥、稻米、玉米， 其基因都已改造成與原來的老祖宗大不相同， 但是我們不認為這些是基改， 因為這些是傳統育種的產物， 如果你問，我是否要把復甦作物的基因放進作物中， 答案是沒錯。"}, {"zh-tw": " In the essence of time,we have tried that approach. More appropriately,some of my collaborators at UCT, Jennifer Thomson, Suhail Rafudeen, have spearheaded that approach and I'm going to show you some data soon.", "en": " 時間就是成敗的關鍵，我們已經試過這種方法。 更正確的說法是我在開普敦大學的合作夥伴， 湯姆森和拉弗丁博士， 已經帶頭做這種方法， 我等一下就會給大家看一些數據。"}, {"zh-tw": " But we're about to embarkupon an extremely ambitious approach, in which we aim to turn onwhole suites of genes that are already present in every crop. They're just never turned onunder extreme drought conditions.", "en": " 但是我們即將用一項非常有野心的方法， 我們的目標是打開一系列基因， 它們本來就存在於每種作物內。 只是在非常乾旱的情況下這些基因從未被打開過。"}, {"zh-tw": " I leave it up to you to decide whether those should be called GM or not. I'm going to now just give yousome of the data from that first approach.", "en": " 我讓大家自己判斷 這該不該稱為基改。 我現在就給大家看一下第一次做的數據。"}, {"zh-tw": " And in order to do that I have to explain a little bitabout how genes work. So you probably all know that genes are madeof double-stranded DNA.", "en": " 為了讓大家明白， 我必須解釋一下基因如何運作。 你們大概都知道 基因由雙股 DNA 組成。"}, {"zh-tw": " It's wound very tightly into chromosomes that are present in every cellof your body or in a plant's body. If you unwind that DNA, you get genes.", "en": " DNA 緊密纏繞成染色體， 存在於你或植物體內的每一個細胞中。 如果你把 DNA 解開，就得到基因。"}, {"zh-tw": " And each gene has a promoter, which is just an on-off switch, the gene coding region, and then a terminator, which indicates that this is the endof this gene, the next gene will start. Now, promoters are notsimple on-off switches.", "en": " 每個基因都有一個啟動子， 就像開關一樣， 還有基因編碼區， 及一個終止子， 表示這是該基因的終點，下一個基因要開始。 啟動子不像開關那麼簡單。"}, {"zh-tw": " They normally requirea lot of fine-tuning, lots of things to be present and correctbefore that gene is switched on. So what's typically donein biotech studies is that we use an inducible promoter, we know how to switch it on.", "en": " 它們通常需要很多微調， 很多條件必須存在且正確，基因才會打開。 所以做生技研究時， 我們通常使用可誘導型啟動子， 我們知道如何開啟它。"}, {"zh-tw": " We couple that to genes of interest and put that into a plantand see how the plant responds. In the study that I'm goingto talk to you about, my collaborators useda drought-induced promoter, which we discoveredin a resurrection plant.", "en": " 我們將其與要研究的基因配對 並放入植物中，看該植物如何反應。 在我要跟大家談的這個研究中， 我的合作夥伴用一種由乾旱誘發的啟動子， 我們在復甦植物中發現。"}, {"zh-tw": " The nice thing about this promoteris that we do nothing. The plant itself senses drought.", "en": " 這個啟動子的好處是我們不用管它。 植物本身會感覺到乾旱。"}, {"zh-tw": " And we've used it to drive antioxidantgenes from resurrection plants. Why antioxidant genes? Well, all stresses,particularly drought stress, results in the formation of free radicals, or reactive oxygen species, which are highly damagingand can cause crop death.", "en": " 我們用這個啟動子驅動復甦植物內的抗氧化基因。 為什麼是抗氧化基因？ 因為所有的逆境，尤其是乾旱， 都會產生自由基， 或活性氧類， 它們的破壞性極強，且會導致作物死亡。"}, {"zh-tw": " What antioxidants do is stop that damage. So here's some data from a maize strainthat's very popularly used in Africa.", "en": " 抗氧化基因會停止該破壞。 現在看到的是某種玉米品系的數據，這在非洲極常使用。"}, {"zh-tw": " To the left of the arroware plants without the genes, to the right -- plants with the antioxidant genes. After three weeks without watering, the ones with the genesdo a hell of a lot better.", "en": " 箭頭左邊的是沒有該基因的植株， 右邊的 植株有抗氧化基因。 三星期不澆水後， 有該基因的植株表現好的不得了。"}, {"zh-tw": " Now to the final approach. My research has shownthat there's considerable similarity in the mechanisms of desiccation tolerancein seeds and resurrection plants.", "en": " 最後一點。 我的研究顯示 種子與復甦植物耐旱性的機制相當相似。"}, {"zh-tw": " So I ask the question, are they using the same genes? Or slightly differently phrased, are resurrection plants using genesevolved in seed desiccation tolerance in their roots and leaves? Have they retasked these seed genes in roots and leavesof resurrection plants? And I answer that question, as a consequence of a lotof research from my group and recent collaborations from a groupof Henk Hilhorst in the Netherlands, Mel Oliver in the United States and Julia Buitink in France. The answer is yes, that there is a core set of genesthat are involved in both.", "en": " 所以我問這個問題， 這兩者都用同樣的基因嗎？ 或用略為不同的問法， 復甦植物會利用種子的耐旱性基因 在根部與植物上嗎？ 它們會把這些種子基因的任務 在根部及葉片上利用嗎？ 我的答案是， 從我的研究小組， 及最近一起合作，位於荷蘭的希和教授， 美國的奧利佛 法國的茱莉亞等所得的結果， 我的答案是有， 的確有一組關鍵基因與兩者都有關。"}, {"zh-tw": " And I'm going to illustrate thisvery crudely for maize, where the chromosomes below the off switch represent all the genes that are requiredfor desiccation tolerance. So as maize seeds dried outat the end of their period of development, they switch these genes on.", "en": " 我用這張圖跟大家粗略說一下玉米的情況， 開關之下的染色體 代表耐旱基因。 玉米在種子發育最後階段要乾掉時， 就會打開這些基因。"}, {"zh-tw": " Resurrection plantsswitch on the same genes when they dry out. All modern crops, therefore, have these genesin their roots and leaves, they just never switch them on.", "en": " 復甦植物在乾掉時也會打開同樣的基因。 因此，所有現代作物 根部及葉片內都有這種基因， 只是從來不打開。"}, {"zh-tw": " They only switch them on in seed tissues. So what we're trying to do right now is to understand the environmentaland cellular signals that switch on these genesin resurrection plants, to mimic the process in crops.", "en": " 它們僅打開種子組織內的這種基因。 所以我們現在正在 瞭解環境與細胞信號 如何打開復甦植物內的這些基因， 並在作物中模擬此過程。"}, {"zh-tw": " And just a final thought. What we're trying to do very rapidly is to repeat what nature didin the evolution of resurrection plants some 10 to 40 million years ago.", "en": " 最後一點想法。 我們現在做的就是， 很快速地重現一千到四千萬年前大自然復甦植物演化的過程。"}, {"zh-tw": " My plants and I thank youfor your attention.", "en": " 我的植物和我都感謝大家的關注。"}], "title": "Jill Farrant How We Can Make Crops Survive Without Water"}
