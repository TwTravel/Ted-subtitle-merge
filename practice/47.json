So I'll try and do that, but I want to start with two thingsthat everyone already knows. And the first one, in fact,is something that has been known for most of recorded history, and that is, that the planet Earth,or the solar system, or our environment or whatever, is uniquely suitedto sustain our evolution -- or creation, as it used to be thought -- and our present existence,and most important, our future survival."}, {"zh-tw": "今天這一個概念有個戲劇化的名字-太空船地球。在這個概念裡，太空船之外宇宙不可調和地充滿敵意，而其內部是我們賴以為生的一切。我們只有一次機會：如果我們弄壞我們的太空船,我們將無處可去.", "en": "Nowadays, this ideahas a dramatic name: Spaceship Earth. And the idea thereis that outside the spaceship, the universe is implacably hostile, and inside is all we have,all we depend on, and we only get the one chance:if we mess up our spaceship, we've got nowhere else to go."}, {"zh-tw": "第二件大家都知道的事是與我們在人類歷史中大部份時間所堅信的相反人類事實上並不是存在的中心.就如史蒂芬·霍金說過我們只是存在於典型的星球表面的化學汙垢這個典型的星球在軌道上環繞著一個典型的恆星,且位於一個典型的銀河系的邊緣,以此類推.", "en": "Now, the second thingthat everyone already knows is that, contrary to what was believedfor most of human history, human beings are not, in fact,the hub of existence. As Stephen Hawking famously said, we're just a chemical scumon the surface of a typical planet that's in orbit around a typical star, which is on the outskirtsof a typical galaxy, and so on."}, {"zh-tw": "大家都知道的兩件事當中的第一件大概是說我們存在於一個非常不典型的地方.獨一無二的適合性等.而第二件事卻說我們存在於一個典型的地方.尤其是當你將這兩件事當作生命中深刻的真理並以此作為你人生決策的依據.那麼他們似乎彼此有些衝突.", "en": "Now, the first of those two thingsthat everyone knows is kind of saying that we're at a very un-typical place,uniquely suited and so on, and the second one is sayingthat we're at a typical place. And, especially if you regardthese two as deep truths to live by and to inform your life decisions, then they seem a little bitto conflict with each other."}, {"zh-tw": "但這也無法改變他們都是徹底錯誤的這個事實.", "en": "But that doesn't prevent themfrom both being completely false.

The vacuum there is one million timesless dense than the highest vacuum that our best technology on Earthcan currently create."}, {"zh-tw": "所以這就是宇宙裡一個典型的地方與這兒如何不同.也就是說我們現在所處的這個地方是如此地不典型.", "en": "So that's how differenta typical place is from this place. And that is how un-typical this place is."}, {"zh-tw": "請開燈,謝謝.那麼我們如何瞭解距離離我們如此遙遠的一個環境呢？與我們所熟悉的一切相比,它是如次不同,如此陌生.地球--我們的環境,以我們這一形式存在-- 創造知識.", "en": "So can we have the lightsback on please? Thank you. Now, how do we know about an environmentthat's so far away and so different and so alien from anything we're used to?

Well, look out even furtherthan we've just been -- I mean from here, with a telescope -- and you'll see things that looklike stars, they're called quasars. \"Quasars\" originally meant\"quasi-stellar object,\" which means \"things that looka bit like stars.\" But they're not stars."}, {"zh-tw": "我們已經知道他們是什麼了.數十億年前,數十億光年之外,一個星系中心的物質朝著一個巨大的黑洞塌陷.", "en": "And we know what they are. Billions of years agoand billions of light-years away, the material at the centerof a galaxy collapsed towards a super-massive black hole."}, {"zh-tw": "隨後密集的磁場對重力塌陷中的一些能量產生了導向作用.其中一些物質.以巨大的噴射流得形式逃離,照亮了宏偉的太空,--我認為相當於一千億個太陽的光亮.然而,與這樣一個噴射流的物理相比,我們大腦的物理大鄉逕庭到極點.", "en": "And then intense magnetic fields directed some of the energyof that gravitational collapse and some of the matter back out in the form of tremendous jets, which illuminated lobes with the brilliance of --I think it's a trillion -- suns.

Not just a superficial image of it,though it contains that as well, but an explanatory model, embodying the samemathematical relationships and the same causal structure."}, {"zh-tw": "這就是知識.如過這還不夠讓你驚訝的話,一個結構表達另外一個的準確性", "en": "Now, that is knowledge. And if that weren't amazing enough, the faithfulness with whichthe one structure resembles the other is increasing with time."}, {"zh-tw": "正隨著時間不斷提高.這就是知識的增長.因此,物理規律擁有這樣一個特殊的性質.物體,不管他們彼此多麼相異,卻仍然能夠表現同樣的數學和因果結構,而且隨著時間增長表現的越來越多.", "en": "That is the growth of knowledge.
