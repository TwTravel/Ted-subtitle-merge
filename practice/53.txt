When she came into my life, we werefighting against a huge waste facility planned for the East River waterfront despite the fact thatour small part of New York City already handled more than 40 percentof the entire city's commercial waste: a sewage treatment pelletizing plant,a sewage sludge plant, four power plants, the world's largestfood-distribution center, as well as other industries that bringmore than 60,000 diesel truck trips to the area each week.", "en": " 她後來長的比我預期的還要大很多。 當她加入我的生活時，我們正在抗議一個龐大的廢棄物處理廠的設置， 他們計畫設在河東濱水區，完全不考慮我們這個區域 已經為整個紐約市處理了超過四成的商業廢棄物。 一座污水處理廠、一座淤泥處理廠、四座發電廠、 加上世界上最大的食品分銷中心， 還有其他產業，每週有超過6萬趟柴油卡車來到這個區域。"}, {"zh-tw": " The area also has one of the lowest ratiosof parks to people in the city. So when I was contactedby the Parks Department about a $10,000 seed-grant initiativeto help develop waterfront projects, I thought they were reallywell-meaning, but a bit naive.", "en": " 這一區同時也是全市公園對人口比最低的地方。 所以當公園單位找上我， 要我進行一項初始規模只有1萬美金的計畫，來發展濱水區域， 我真的覺得他們的想法很有意義，但是太過天真了點。"}, {"zh-tw": " I'd lived in this area all my life,and you could not get to the river, because of all the lovely facilitiesthat I mentioned earlier.

Many landlords believed it was moreprofitable to torch their buildings and collect insurance money ratherthan to sell under those conditions -- dead or injured former tenantsnotwithstanding.", "en": " 而那些白人遷離的區域，包括我們這一區， 就被銀行畫了紅線，禁止任何投資。 許多地主認為，把他們的建築用火燒掉， 收取的保險費還比在那種狀況下賣掉來的好， 完全不考慮房客的死傷。"}, {"zh-tw": " Hunts Point was formerlya walk-to-work community, but now residents had neitherwork nor home to walk to. A national highway construction boomwas added to our problems.", "en": " 獵點社區以前曾經是個可以走路去工作的社區， 但現在當地的居民要不沒有工作，要不就是連家也沒有。 後來全國性的高速公路擴張計畫，更使我們雪上加霜。"}, {"zh-tw": " In New York State, Robert Moses spearheadedan aggressive highway-expansion campaign.

Because from a planning perspective, economic degradationbegets environmental degradation, which begets social degradation. The disinvestment that beganin the 1960s set the stage for all the environmentalinjustices that were to come.", "en": " 這個故事有什麼值得一提的地方嗎？ 就規劃的角度而言，經濟的衰退， 會導致環境的衰敗，還會引發社會的動亂。 而這種不投資於我們社區的策略始於1960年代， 因此導致目前我們所看到環境上的不公不義的現象。"}, {"zh-tw": " Antiquated zoning and land-useregulations are still used to this day to continue putting pollutingfacilities in my neighborhood.
