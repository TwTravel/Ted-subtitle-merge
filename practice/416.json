Murdering -- Audience: Bee? Dennis vanEngelsdorp: Bee. Okay, thanks. What these bees do is, they sit there. These solitary bees, they drill a hole in the ground or drill a hole in a branch, and they collect pollen and make it into a ball, and they lay an egg on it.", "en": " 另外我們還有另外一類蜂，叫做偷寄生蜂， 它還有個很有創意的名字：壞脾氣的謀殺-- 我在想那個詞呢？ 聽眾：蜂? 鄧尼斯-範-恩格勒斯多普:蜂!是的，謝謝！ 這些蜂的做法就是守株待兔。這些獨居蜂， 它們在地面或者樹枝上打好洞， 收集來花粉做成花粉球， 然後在花粉球上產一枚卵。"}, {"zh-tw": " Well, these bees hang out at that hole, and they wait for that mother to fly away, they go in, eat the egg, and lay their own egg there.
