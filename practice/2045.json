No knock on the neuroscientists.", "en": " 但在某種意義上，這些只是簡單的疑問， 並沒有難倒神經學家。"}, {"zh-tw": " There are no truly easyproblems with consciousness.

It'll turn out to be another emergent phenomenon like traffic jams, like hurricanes, like life, and we'll figure it out.", "en": " 或許你會說 再多給神經科學多一些時間， 它最終會向我們說明意識也是一種湧現現象， 就像交通堵塞、龍捲風， 就像生命，我們會搞清楚的。"}, {"zh-tw": " The classical cases of emergence are all cases of emergent behavior, how a traffic jam behaves, how a hurricane functions, how a living organism reproduces and adapts and metabolizes, all questions about objective functioning.

It's a long story, but the core idea is just that what you get from purely reductionist explanations in physical terms, in brain-based terms, is stories about the functioning of a system, its structure, its dynamics, the behavior it produces, great for solving the easy problems — how we behave, how we function — but when it comes to subjective experience — why does all this feel likesomething from the inside? — that's something fundamentally new, and it's always a further question.", "en": " 但我最終得出一個結論 由於系統原因，它不會奏效。 說來話長， 但是思想的核心就是 你從物理方面，在基於大腦方面 通過純粹的還原解釋得到的 都是關於系統的運行， 它的結構、活力、 產生的行為 很適合解決簡單問題， 比如我們的行為如何活動， 但涉及到主觀體驗時， 為什麼這些都像是來自內部？ 這是個全新的 更進一步的問題。"}, {"zh-tw": " So I think we're at a kind of impasse here. We've got this wonderful, great chain of explanation, we're used to it, where physics explains chemistry, chemistry explains biology, biology explains parts of psychology.", "en": " 我覺得我們有點兒卡在這了， 我們有一套美妙的解釋鏈， 我們習慣了用物理解釋化學， 用化學解釋生物學， 用生物學解釋心理學的一部分。"}, {"zh-tw": " But consciousness doesn't seem to fit into this picture.

Now, there are a few candidates for what those crazy ideas might be.", "en": " 面對這樣的異常事物， 可能需要激進的想法， 我認為，我們在科學地 抓住意識之前， 可能需要一兩個 最初看起來瘋狂的點子。 現在對於這些瘋狂的想法是什麼， 已經有了一些選項。"}, {"zh-tw": " My friend Dan Dennett, who's here today, has one. His crazy idea is that there is no hard problem of consciousness.", "en": " 我的朋友 Dan Dennet有一個想法，他今天也來了， 他認為關於意識 完全沒有什麼難題。"}, {"zh-tw": " The whole idea of the inner subjective movie involves a kind of illusion or confusion. Actually, all we've got to do is explain the objective functions, the behaviors of the brain, and then we've explained everything that needs to be explained.", "en": " 主觀電影這一觀點 涉及到一種幻覺或困惑， 實際上我們需要做的就是解釋 客觀功能大腦的行為活動， 然後就解釋了一切 需要被解釋的"}, {"zh-tw": " Well I say, more power to him. That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if you want to have a purely reductionist brain-based theory of consciousness.", "en": " 要我說賜予他更多力量吧。 我們需要探索 這種激進的想法， 如果你想得出純簡化論的關於 意識的基於大腦的理論。"}, {"zh-tw": " At the same time, for me and for many other people, that view is a bit too close to simply denying the datum of consciousness to be satisfactory. So I go in a different direction.", "en": " 同時，對我和其他人來說， 這個觀點有些接近簡單地 直接否定有關意識的已知資料， 而不能令人滿意， 因此我選擇了另外一個方向。"}, {"zh-tw": " In the time remaining, I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think may have some promise. The first crazy idea is that consciousness is fundamental.", "en": " 在剩下的時間裡， 我想探討兩個我認為 可能有希望的想法。 第一個瘋狂的想法就是 意識是一種基本概念。"}, {"zh-tw": " Physicists sometimes takesome aspects of the universe as fundamental building blocks: space and time and mass. They postulate fundamental laws governing them, like the laws of gravity or of quantum mechanics.", "en": " 物理學家有時會把宇宙中的某些方面 作為一種基本概念： 空間、時間，和質量。 他們假定一些基本定律來約束它們， 比如重力定律，或量子力學定律，"}, {"zh-tw": " These fundamental properties and laws aren't explained in terms of anything more basic. Rather, they're taken as primitive, and you build up the world from there.", "en": " 這些基本性質和定律 並不能解釋一些更基礎的東西， 這相當於以它們為基礎， 然後在構建其他。"}, {"zh-tw": " Now sometimes, the list of fundamentals expands. In the 19th century, Maxwell figured out that you can't explain electromagnetic phenomena in terms of the existing fundamentals — space, time, mass, Newton's laws — so he postulated fundamental laws of electromagnetism and postulated electric charge as a fundamental element that those laws govern.", "en": " 現在這張基本定律的清單不時會擴大， 19世紀 Maxwell 發現 不能用當時存在的基本概念—— 空間、時間、質量、牛頓定律 來解釋電磁現象， 因此他設定了電磁現象的 基本定律， 設定電荷作為 這些定律的 基本元素。"}, {"zh-tw": " I think that's the situation we're in with consciousness. If you can't explain consciousness in terms of the existing fundamentals — space, time, mass, charge — then as a matter of logic,you need to expand the list.", "en": " 我認為這與我們在 研究意識上的情形是一樣的， 如果你不能用現有的 基本概念來解釋意識、 空間、時間、質量、電荷， 那麼從邏輯上來講就應該擴展清單。"}, {"zh-tw": " The natural thing to do is to postulate consciousness itself as something fundamental, a fundamental building block of nature. This doesn't mean you suddenlycan't do science with it.", "en": " 自然就應該假設意識 為某種根本的東西， 自然界中最基本的一部分。 這不意味著突然就不能用它來研究科學，"}, {"zh-tw": " This opens up the way for you to do science with it. What we then need is to study the fundamental laws governing consciousness, the laws that connect consciousness to other fundamentals: space, time, mass, physical processes.", "en": " 它為你研究科學開闢了一條新路， 我們需要做的就是研究 控制意識的基本定律、 那些將意識與其他基本概念， 空間、時間、質量 相聯繫的概念。"}, {"zh-tw": " Physicists sometimes say that we want fundamental laws so simple that we could write them on the front of a t-shirt. Well I think something like that is the situation we're in with consciousness.", "en": " 物理學家有時會說 我們希望基本定律簡單地 能讓我們印在T恤上， 我想對意識的研究 也同樣如此。"}, {"zh-tw": " We want to find fundamental laws so simple we could write them on the front of a t-shirt. We don't know what those laws are yet, but that's what we're after.", "en": " 我們希望基本定律簡單的 能讓我們印在T恤上。 我們現在還不知道這些定律， 但這是我們接下來要做的。"}, {"zh-tw": " The second crazy idea is that consciousness might be universal. Every system might have some degree of consciousness.", "en": " 第二個瘋狂的想法是 意識也許是普遍存在的。 每個系統都有 某種程度的意識，"}, {"zh-tw": " This view is sometimes called panpsychism: pan for all, psych for mind, every system is conscious, not just humans, dogs, mice, flies, but even Rob Knight's microbes, elementary particles. Even a photon has some degree of consciousness.", "en": " 這種觀點被稱作泛心論， 一切皆有心理活動， 每個系統都是有意識的， 不僅僅是人類、狗、老鼠、蒼蠅， 甚至 Rob Knight 的微生物， 基本粒子都有意識， 甚至一個光子都有某種程度的意識。"}, {"zh-tw": " The idea is not that photons are intelligent or thinking. It's not that a photon is wracked with angst because it's thinking, \"Aww, I'm alwaysbuzzing around near the speed of light.", "en": " 這一觀點並不表明光子擁有智慧 或更夠思考， 不是說一個光子會 陷入深深地焦慮， 因為它想著：「我總是以光速跑來跑去，"}, {"zh-tw": " I never get to slow down and smell the roses.\" No, not like that. But the thought is maybe photons might have some element of raw, subjective feeling, some primitive precursor to consciousness.", "en": " 從未停下來輕嗅玫瑰。」 並不是這樣。 而是表明光子也可能有 一些原始的主觀體驗， 一些原始的意識的前兆，"}, {"zh-tw": " This may sound a bit kooky to you. I mean, why would anyone think such a crazy thing? Some motivation comes from the first crazy idea, that consciousness is fundamental.", "en": " 這對你來說可能有些奇怪， 為什麼會有人思考這種瘋狂的事呢？ 一些動機來自第一個瘋狂的想法， 即意識是基本概念。"}, {"zh-tw": " If it's fundamental, like space and time and mass, it's natural to suppose that it might be universal too, the way they are. It's also worth noting that although the idea seems counterintuitive to us, it's much less counterintuitive to people from different cultures, where the human mind is seen as much more continuous with nature.", "en": " 如果它同空間、時間、質量一樣是基本概念， 那自然也可以假定它具有普遍性， 同其他基本概念一樣。 還有一點值得注意的是， 雖然這個想法對我們來說是反直覺的， 但對於來自其他文化的人來說 沒那麼反直覺， 那裡人的心靈同自然 緊密相連。"}, {"zh-tw": " A deeper motivation comes from the idea that perhaps the most simple and powerful way to find fundamental laws connecting consciousness to physical processing is to link consciousness to information. Wherever there's information processing, there's consciousness.", "en": " 從這個想法中得到的更深一層動機是 也許找出將意識同物理過程 相聯繫的 最簡單有效的方法就是 將意識與資訊相結合。 有資訊處理的地方 就有意識，"}, {"zh-tw": " Complex information processing, like in a human, complex consciousness. Simple information processing, simple consciousness.", "en": " 複雜的資訊處理，比如人類的 複雜的意識， 簡單的資訊處理， 就有簡單的意識。"}, {"zh-tw": " A really exciting thing is in recent years a neuroscientist, Giulio Tononi, has taken this kind of theory and developed it rigorously with a mathematical theory. He has a mathematical measure of information integration which he calls phi, measuring the amount of information integrated in a system.", "en": " 近年來最令人興奮的是 神經學家 Giulio Tononi 採用了這種理論 並將其嚴格按照 數學理論發展。 他有一個關於資訊整合的 數學測量， 他稱之為 phi， 用來測量一個系統中 資訊整合的量。"}, {"zh-tw": " And he supposes that phi goes along with consciousness. So in a human brain, incredibly large amount of information integration, high degree of phi, a whole lot of consciousness.", "en": " 他推測 phi 同 意識相關 所以在人類大腦中 有令人難以置信的資訊整合數量， 高度的 phi 值， 大量的意識。"}, {"zh-tw": " In a mouse, medium degreeof information integration, still pretty significant, pretty serious amount of consciousness. But as you go down to worms, microbes, particles, the amount of phi falls off.", "en": " 老鼠有中等程度的資訊整合數量， 但數目仍然龐大， 有大量的意識。 但降至蠕蟲、 微生物、粒子， phi 的值就會跌落，"}, {"zh-tw": " The amount of information integration falls off, but it's still non-zero. On Tononi's theory, there's still going to be a non-zero degree of consciousness.", "en": " 資訊整合數量下降， 但並沒有降至零。 在 Tononi 的理論中， 意識程度也不會 降至為零。"}, {"zh-tw": " In effect, he's proposing a fundamental law of consciousness: high phi, high consciousness. Now, I don't know if this theory is right, but it's actually perhaps the leading theory right now in the science of consciousness, and it's been used to integrate a whole range of scientific data, and it does have a nice propertythat it is in fact simple enough you can write it on the front of a t-shirt.", "en": " 事實上他提出了一個關於意識的基本定律， phi 值越高，意識程度越高。 現在我不清楚這個理論是否正確， 但它實際上是意識科學的 前沿理論， 並且它被用於整合 各方面的科學數據， 並有一個優勢，就是它實際上十分簡單， 可以印在T恤上。"}, {"zh-tw": " Another final motivation is that panpsychism might help us to integrate consciousness into the physical world. Physicists and philosophers have often observed that physics is curiously abstract.", "en": " 另一個最終動機就是 泛心論可以幫助我們將 意識和物理世界相結合。 物理學家和哲學家經常發現 物理學十分深奧抽象，"}, {"zh-tw": " It describes the structure of reality using a bunch of equations, but it doesn't tell us about the reality that underlies it. As Stephen Hawking puts it, what puts the fire into the equations? Well, on the panpsychist view, you can leave the equations of physics as they are, but you can take them to be describing the flux of consciousness.", "en": " 它用一連串方程式去 描述現實結構， 但又不告訴我們 構成它的現實基礎。 正如 Stephen Hawking 所說， 什麼把火放入了方程式？ 從泛心論者來看， 物理方程式可以是它現在的樣子， 也可以用它們來描述 意識的量。"}, {"zh-tw": " That's what physics really is ultimately doing, describing the flux of consciousness. On this view, it's consciousness that puts the fire into the equations.", "en": " 這是物理學最終要做的， 描述意識的量， 從這一角度 是意識把火放進了方程式。"}, {"zh-tw": " On that view, consciousness doesn't dangle outside the physical world as some kind of extra. It's there right at its heart.", "en": " 從那種觀點來看 意識不是晃蕩在物理世界之外 某種剝離出來的東西， 它就在物理世界的核心。"}, {"zh-tw": " This view, I think, the panpsychist view, has the potential to transfigure our relationship to nature, and it may have some pretty serious social and ethical consequences. Some of these may be counterintuitive.", "en": " 我認為這種泛心論觀點 有改變我們與自然關係的 潛質， 並有可能產生一些嚴重的 社會倫理影響， 其中一些可能是違背直覺的。"}, {"zh-tw": " I used to think I shouldn't eat anything which is conscious, so therefore I should be vegetarian. Now, if you're a panpsychist and you take that view, you're going to go very hungry.", "en": " 我過去認為自己不應該吃 任何有生命的東西， 因此我成為素食主義者， 現在如果你是泛心論者並同意這一觀點， 你就要挨餓了。"}, {"zh-tw": " So I think when you think about it, this tends to transfigure your views, whereas what matters for ethical purposes and moral considerations, not so much the fact of consciousness, but the degree and the complexity of consciousness. It's also natural to ask about consciousness in other systems, like computers.", "en": " 所以當你思考它的時候， 會使你有改變觀點的傾向， 但對於倫理目標和 道德考量來說， 最重要的不是關於意識的事實， 而是意識的程度和複雜性。 最然也會探討 其他系統中的意識，比如電腦。"}, {"zh-tw": " What about the artificially intelligent system in the movie \"Her,\" Samantha? Is she conscious? Well, if you take the informational, panpsychist view, she certainly has complicated information processing and integration, so the answer is very likely yes, she is conscious. If that's right, it raises pretty serious ethical issues about both the ethics of developing intelligent computer systems and the ethics of turning them off.", "en": " 電影《她》中的人工智慧 Samantha 是什麼情況？ 她有意識嗎？ 如果你用這種資訊性的 泛心論的觀點來看， 她能進行複雜的資訊處理 和整合， 答案很有可能是，她有意識。 如果答案正確， 那麼不管開發智能計算機系統， 還是關閉它們 都會引發很嚴重的倫理問題。"}, {"zh-tw": " Finally, you might ask about the consciousness of whole groups, the planet. Does Canada have its own consciousness? Or at a more local level, does an integrated group like the audience at a TED conference, are we right now having acollective TED consciousness, an inner movie for this collective TED group which is distinct from the inner movies of each of our parts? I don't know the answer to that question, but I think it's at least one worth taking seriously.", "en": " 最後你可能問 集體意識、 星球的意識、 加拿大有自己的意識嗎？ 或從地方層面來說， 一個組合的整體 比如 TED 演講的觀眾 擁有集體 TED 意識嗎？ 這個 TED 集體的 內在電影 與我們每個人的 內在電影不同嗎？ 我不知道這個問題的答案， 但我認為至少它 值得重視。"}, {"zh-tw": " Okay, so this panpsychist vision, it is a radical one, and I don't know that it's correct. I'm actually more confident about the first crazy idea, that consciousness is fundamental, than about the second one, that it's universal.", "en": " 泛心論者的觀點 十分激進， 我不知道它是否正確， 我其實對第一個瘋狂的想法 更有信心， 即意識是一種基本概念， 而不是第二個想法， 意識是普遍存在的。"}, {"zh-tw": " I mean, the view raises any number of questions, has any number of challenges, like how do those little bits of consciousness add up to the kind of complex consciousness we know and love. If we can answer those questions, then I think we're going to be well on our way to a serious theory of consciousness.", "en": " 我的意思是，這個觀點引發了很多問題， 有很多挑戰， 比如那些意識的片段 是如何疊加成 我們熟知並喜愛的 複雜意識的。 如果我們你回答這些問題， 那我們就能在通往嚴肅意識理論的 道路上順利走下去。"}, {"zh-tw": " If not, well, this is the hardest problem perhaps in science and philosophy. We can't expect to solve it overnight.", "en": " 如果不能，這些也許就是科學和 哲學上最難的問題。 我們不能期待一個晚上就解決，"}, {"zh-tw": " But I do think we're going to figure it out eventually. Understanding consciousness is a real key, I think, both to understanding the universe and to understanding ourselves.", "en": " 但我想我們最終會解決它， 理解意識 是理解宇宙和我們自己的關鍵，"}, {"zh-tw": " It may just take the right crazy idea. Thank you.", "en": " 這也許只需要採取正確的瘋狂想法。 謝謝。"}], "title": "David Chalmers How Do You Explain Consciousness"}
