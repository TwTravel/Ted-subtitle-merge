We who are diplomats, we are trained to deal with conflicts between states and issues between states.", "en": " 在所有今日世人仍然必需去努力實現的種種令人憂心的缺點之中--- 我們認為金融和經濟是最根本主要的-- 但是我最關心的是 是政治上對話的不足-- 我們有能力應付現今的衝突 實際上就是， 找到事情發生的原因 了解關鍵人物 再和他們打交道。 這就是我們：這些外交官， 我們受過訓練以應付國家之間的衝突及問題"}, {"zh-tw": " And I can tell you, our agenda is full. There is trade, there is disarmament, there is cross-border relations.", "en": " 我可以告訴你們，我們的工作滿檔。 工作內容有貿易，有裁減軍備， 有跨界關係。"}, {"zh-tw": " But the picture is changing, and we are seeing that there are new key players coming onto the scene.

These are quite different, and they are outside the grasp of modern diplomacy.", "en": " 紅色部份是現今的衝突 國家內部的衝突 兩者是完全不同的 連現今的外交 都無法掌握"}, {"zh-tw": " And the core of these key actors are groups who represent different interests inside countries. And the way they deal with their conflicts rapidly spreads to other countries.", "en": " 這些關鍵參與者的核心 就是集團 他們代表著國家內部 不同的利益 他們處理衝突的方式迅速蔓延到其他國家"}, {"zh-tw": " So in a way, it is everybody's business. Another acknowledgment we've seen during these years, recent years, is that very few of these domestic interstate, intrastate conflicts can be solved militarily.", "en": " 所以，在某種程度上而言，這是攸關眾人之事 另一件我們這幾年所見印證的事 近幾年 就是極少數的 國內的州際之間、州內的衝突 可以用軍事來解決"}, {"zh-tw": " They may have to be dealt with with military means, but they cannot be solved by military means. They need political solutions.", "en": " 他們處理時可能會涉及軍事 但是不能用軍事手段來解決 他們需要用到政治解決方案"}, {"zh-tw": " And we, therefore, have a problem, because they escape traditional diplomacy.

And we find out in the West that we know very little about what's happening.", "en": " 社會集團走上街頭 我們發現在西方 我們對於發生的事所知甚少"}, {"zh-tw": " Because we never talk to the people in these countries. Most governments followed the dictate of the authoritarian leaders to stay away from these different groups, because they were terrorists.", "en": " 因為我們從不和這些國家的人民交談 大部份政府遵守 獨裁主義領導人的命令規定 就是遠離這些各種不同的集團 因為他們曾是恐怖份子"}, {"zh-tw": " So now that they are emerging in the street and we salute the democratic revolution, we find out how little we know. Right now, the discussion goes, \"Should we talk to the Muslim Brotherhood? Should we talk to Hamas? If we talk to them, we may legitimize them.\" I think that is wrong.", "en": " 所以現在他們出現在街頭 我們讚揚民主革命 我們發現我們所知竟如此之少 就是現在，討論下去 我們是不是應該和穆斯林弟兄會交談? 我們是不是應該和哈瑪斯交談? 如果我們和他們交談，就是承認他們合法 我覺得這是不對的"}, {"zh-tw": " If you talk in the right way, you make it very clear that talking is not agreeing. And how can we tell the Muslim Brotherhood, as we should, that they must respect minority rights, if we don't accept majority rights? Because they may turn out to be a majority.", "en": " 如果用正確的方式交談，你非常明白 這樣的交談是不被同意的 而且我們要怎樣才能告訴穆斯林弟兄會? 就像我們應該告訴他們一樣 他們必需尊重少數人的權利 如果我們不接受多數人的權利? 因為他們可能變成多數人"}, {"zh-tw": " How can we escape [having] a double-standard, if we at the same time preach democracy and at the same time don't want to deal with the groups that are representative? How will we ever be interlocutors? Now my diplomats are instructed to talk to all these groups. But talking can be done in different ways.", "en": " 我們怎能避免雙重標準? 如果我們同時宣揚民主 然而 又不想和具有代表性的集團打交道 我們如何永遠做個談話對象? 所以現在教我的外交官被教導 要和所有這樣的集團交談 但是談話有各種不同的方式"}, {"zh-tw": " We make a distinction between talking from a diplomatic level and talking at the political level. Now talking can be accompanied with aid or not with aid.", "en": " 我們從外交層面的談話 以及政治層面的談話做個區分 現在談話分成有援助也有沒有援助的"}, {"zh-tw": " Talking can be accompanied with inclusion or not inclusion. There's a big array of the ways of dealing with this.", "en": " 也分成有內容的也有沒有內容的 有一大批 處理這些問題的方式"}, {"zh-tw": " So if we refuse to talk to these new groups that are going to be dominating the news in years to come, we will further radicalization, I believe. We will make the road from violent activities into politics harder to travel.", "en": " 所以如果我們拒絕 與這些今後幾年將主導新聞 的新集團談話 我們將更激進化 我相信 我們將使這條路從暴力活動進入政治活動 更難以行進"}, {"zh-tw": " And if we cannot demonstrate to these groups that if you move towards democracy, if you move towards taking part in civilized and normal standards among states, there are some rewards on the other side. The paradox here is that the last decade probably was a lost decade for making progress on this.", "en": " 如果我們無法向這些集團證明 如果你向民主妥協 如果你走向參與 國家之間的文明及正常標準 對方會有回報的 這裏有個自相矛盾的議論 就是最後的這十年完全沒有進展 是個失去的十年"}, {"zh-tw": " And the paradox is that the decade before the last decade was so promising -- and for one reason primarily. And the reason is what happened in South Africa: Nelson Mandela.", "en": " 而自相矛盾的議論就是十年前到二十年前中間這段時間相當有前景 主要的原因之一 原因就是在南非發生的事 尼爾遜 曼德拉"}, {"zh-tw": " When Mandela came out of prison after 27 years of captivity, if he had told his people, \"It's time to take up the arms, it's time to fight,\" he would have been followed. And I think the international community would have said, \"Fair enough.", "en": " 當曼德拉在27年的牢獄之災之後 從牢裏被放出來的時候 如果他告訴國民 “拿起武器的時候到了， 作戰的時候到了，” 就會有人聽他的話 而且我想國際社會 會說，“很好。"}, {"zh-tw": " It's their right to fight.\" Now as you know, Mandela didn't do that. In his memoirs, \"Long Road to Freedom,\" he wrote that he survived during those years of captivity because he always decided to look upon his oppressor as also being a human being, also being a human being.", "en": " 他們有權開戰 現在如你所知，曼德拉並未如此做 在他的回憶錄“漫漫自由路”中 他寫道他活在 牢獄之中的這些年 因為他總是決定將壓迫他的人 也看做是個人 也視為一個人"}, {"zh-tw": " So he engaged a political process of dialogue, not as a strategy of the weak, but as a strategy of the strong. And he engaged talking profoundly by settling some of the most tricky issues through a truth and reconciliation process where people came and talked.", "en": " 所以他參與了一個政治對話進程 不是弱者的戰略 而是強者的戰略 而且他從事深入交談 透過解決一些最棘手的問題 憑藉著真相及和解的進程 人們來到這裏而且交談著"}, {"zh-tw": " Now South African friends will know that was very painful. So what can we learn from all of this? Dialogue is not easy -- not between individuals, not between groups, not between governments -- but it is very necessary.", "en": " 現在南非的朋友會知道 那很痛苦 所以我們從這一切中學到了什麼? 對話並不簡單 不管於人與人之間，集團與集團之間，政府與政府之間 它都是非常必要的"}, {"zh-tw": " If we're going to deal with political conflict-solving of conflicts, if we're going to understand these new groups which are coming from bottom-up, supported by technology, which is available to all, we diplomats cannot be sitting back in the banquets believing that we are doing interstate relations. We have to connect with these profound changes.", "en": " 如果我們要解決政治上的衝突 如果我們要了解這些新團體 這些事都是從下至上、從細節到總體、從個別到全貌而來的 有科技資助，每個人都會知道 我們做外交官的總不能在宴會時坐在後方 然後就相信我們正在做國際關係 我們必需拉攏 這些深刻改變的關係"}, {"zh-tw": " And what is dialogue really about? When I enter into dialogue, I really hope that the other side would pick up my points of view, that I would impress upon them my opinions and my values. I cannot do that unless I send the signals that I will be open to listen to the other side's signals.", "en": " 而對話的真意為何? 當我和他人交談時 我真誠的希望對方 能抓到我的觀點 我就會讓他們留下深刻的印象 我的意見和我的價值觀 但是我不能做這樣的事 除非我示意我會公開地表示 我一直都會注意你的暗示"}, {"zh-tw": " We need a lot more training on how to do that and a lot more practice on how that can take problem-solving forward. We know from our personal experiences that it's easy sometimes just to walk, and sometimes you may need to fight.", "en": " 我們需要更多如何做到這一點的訓練 以及更多的練習 在如何將解決問題推展開來 我們從自己體驗中知道 它有時候很容易 就只是走出去 有時候卻需要開戰"}, {"zh-tw": " And I wouldn't say that is the wrong thing in all circumstances. Sometimes you have to.", "en": " 我不會說在所有情況下那都是件錯事 因為有時候你必需這樣做"}, {"zh-tw": " But that strategy seldom takes you very far. The alternative is a strategy of engagement and principled dialogue.", "en": " 但那策略不會花你太多時間 換個方式也是 作戰和有原則對話的策略"}, {"zh-tw": " And I believe we need to strengthen this approach in modern diplomacy, not only between states, but also within states. We are seeing some new signs.", "en": " 而且我相信我們必需鞏固這個方法 在現今的外交上 不只是國與國之間 也是國家內部間 我們看見一些新的跡象"}, {"zh-tw": " We could never have done the convention against anti-personnel landmines and the convention that is banning cluster munitions unless we had done diplomacy differently, by engaging with civil society. All of a sudden, NGOs were not only standing in the streets, crying their slogans, but they were taking [them] into the negotiations, partly because they represented the victims of these weapons.", "en": " 我們永遠無法完成 反對殺傷性地雷的協定 以及禁止大規模軍火彈藥的協定 除非我們完成了不同的外交 透過與民間社會銜接 忽然間 非政府組織不是只站在街頭，為他們的口號哭泣， 而且還將它們帶入協商中 部份因為他們是這些武器犧牲者的代表"}, {"zh-tw": " And they brought their knowledge. And there was an interaction between diplomacy and the power coming bottom-up.", "en": " 而且還帶來了他們的知識 在外交和從下而上的力量之間 互相影響"}, {"zh-tw": " This is perhaps a first element of a change. In the future, I believe, we should draw examples from these different illustrations, not to have diplomacy which is disconnected from people and civil society.", "en": " 這可能是改變的 第一個因素 未來，我相信 我們應該從這些不同的實例中找出範例 但不包括外交 因為外交脫離了人民及民間社會"}, {"zh-tw": " And we have to go also beyond traditional diplomacy to the survival issue of our times, climate change. How are we going to solve climate change through negotiations, unless we are able to make civil society and people, not part of the problem, but part of the solution? It is going to demand an inclusive process of diplomacy very different from the one we are practicing today as we are heading to new rounds of difficult climate negotiations, but when we move toward something which has to be much more along a broad mobilization.", "en": " 我們也必需 超越傳統外交 來到我們這個時代的生存問題 趨勢的改變 我們如何透過談判來解決趨勢的改變? 除非我們能使民間社會及人民 不是問題的一部份，而是解決方案的一部份。 這就是要求一個外交的包括性的進程 與今日實行的大不相同 因為我們正朝著困難趨勢談判的新一輪邁進 但是當我們接近某件事情的時候 它就應該更加 順著廣泛的調動"}, {"zh-tw": " It's crucial to understand, I believe, because of technology and because of globalization, societies from bottom-up. We as diplomats need to know the social capital of communities.", "en": " 了解這一點很重要，我相信 因為科技也因為全球化 從下而上的社會 我們身為外交家 需要了解共同社會的 社會資本"}, {"zh-tw": " What is it that makes people trust each other, not only between states, but also within states? What is the legitimacy of diplomacy, of the the solution we devise as diplomats if they cannot be reflected and understood by also these broader forces of societies that we now very loosely call groups? The good thing is that we are not powerless. We have never had as many means of communication, means of being connected, means of reaching out, means of including.", "en": " 是什麼使得人們互相信任彼此 不只是國與國之間 也是國家內部 什麼是外交的合法性? 什麼是我們身為外交官所制定的解決方案的合法性? 如果合法性不能也透過社會上更廣泛的力量 來反省及了解 我們現在又如何能概括的稱之為團體? 好事是我們並非無能為力 而是我們從來沒有 許多溝通的方法 連結的方法，求助的方法 包括各種方法"}, {"zh-tw": " The diplomatic toolbox is actually full of different tools we can use to strengthen our communication. But the problem is that we are coming out of a decade where we had a fear of touching it.", "en": " 外交工具箱 實際上有很多我們可以使用的各種不同的工具 來強化我們彼此間的溝通 但問題是未來的十年裏 很怕用到它"}, {"zh-tw": " Now, I hope, in the coming years, that we are able to demonstrate through some concrete examples that fear is receding and that we can take courage from that alliance with civil society in different countries to support their problem-solving, among the Afghans, inside the Palestinian population, between the peoples of Palestine and Israel. And as we try to understand this broad movement across the Arab world, we are not powerless.", "en": " 現在，我希望，在來年 我們能夠透過一些具體的範例來證明 恐懼消退 我們可以 從聯盟中 和不同國家中的 公民社會拿出勇氣 去支持他們解決 阿富汗人之間 巴勒斯坦人口之內 在巴勒斯坦和以色列人民之間的問題 而隨著我們試著了解這廣泛的調動時 只要跨越阿拉伯世界 我們就不是毫無力量"}, {"zh-tw": " We need to improve the necessary skills, and we need the courage to use them. In my country, I have seen how the council of Islamist groups and Christian groups came together, not as a government initiative, but they came together on their own initiative to establish contact and dialogue in times where things were pretty low-key tension.", "en": " 我們必需改進必要的技能 我們需要勇氣來使用他們 在我的國家裏 我看到伊斯蘭集團的協調會 及基督教集團 是怎麼一起來的，不是政府提倡的 而是出於自願的一起來 來建立接觸及對話 在事情低調、不緊繃的時機下"}, {"zh-tw": " And when tension increased, they already had that dialogue, and that was a strength to deal with different issues.
