Polar bears on the Artic Ocean move in dead straight lines.", "en": " 這裡有關於仿生學的一些知識 北極熊在北冰洋只知道向前走"}, {"zh-tw": " If they come to water, they'll climb in, swim across it. So we had a dry suit developed -- I worked with a team in Norway -- based on a sort of survival suit -- I suppose, that helicopter pilots would wear -- that I could climb into. It would go on over my boots, over my mittens, it would pull up around my face, and seal pretty tightly around my face.", "en": " 如果牠們遇到水面，牠們會游過去。 所以我們和挪威科學小組合作，基於救生衣的原理 設計了一套潛水裝 我想，直升機飛行員也許會用得到 當我爬進這件外套裡，它會從靴子蓋到手套 還可以拉上來蓋住我的臉，形成密閉的一圈。"}, {"zh-tw": " And this meant I could ski over very thin ice, and if I fell through, it wasn't the end of the world. It also meant, if the worst came to the worst, I could actually jump in and swim across and drag the sledge over after me.", "en": " 這表示我可以在非常薄的冰層上面 滑雪， 如果我掉下去，也不會是世界末日。 所以即使到了最糟的情況 我可以跳到水裡，然後游過去 還能拖著我的雪橇。"}, {"zh-tw": " Some pretty radical technology, a radical approach --but it worked perfectly.
