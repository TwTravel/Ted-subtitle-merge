So what do I mean when I say \"suspended animation\"? It is the process by which animals de-animate, appear dead and then can wake up again without being harmed.", "en": " 而我在說的概念 是利用暫停生命 幫助人們能脫離傷害 所以到底什麼是我的本意 當我說\"暫停生命\"呢? 那是一種程序能使 動物暫時不動 就像死亡 但又能無害地被救醒"}, {"zh-tw": " OK, so here is the sort of big idea: If you look out at nature, you find that as you tend to see suspended animation, you tend to see immortality. And so, what I'm going to tell you about is a way to tell a person who's in trauma -- find a way to de-animate them a bit so they're a little more immortal when they have that heart attack.", "en": " 好吧!這就是大致上的概念 在自然界中 能找到的 關於暫停生命 就似乎是\"不死\" 所以 我打的比方就是 在極度創傷中的人們 能暫停一下他們的生命 例如 心臟病發時 他們可以稍稍的\"不死\""}, {"zh-tw": " An example of an organism or two that happens to be quite immortal would be plant seeds or bacterial spores.

And so we wondered: Might there be some agent that is in us, something that we make ourselves, that we might be able to regulate our own metabolic flexibility in such a way as to be able to survive when we got extremely cold, and might otherwise pass away? I thought it might be interesting to sort of hunt for such things.", "en": " 所以 我們就想像 連結所有可能因素 猜想 那滑雪者所有與眾不同的情境 所以我們猜測 可能有一機制 能夠自然地讓我們 有改變生命狀態的彈性 讓我們能遇到低溫狀態還能存活下來的方式 不然只有死亡一途 我對搜尋如此的機制感到興趣"}, {"zh-tw": " You know? I should mention briefly here that physiology textbooks that you can read about will tell you that this is a kind of heretical thing to suggest.

And so, we went looking for such things.", "en": " 但我同時知道一些 生物實例 也是哺乳動物 能降低代謝速率 如松鼠 熊 他們能降低代謝速率 於冬天休眠狀態 所以 我希望能找到一些機制或觸發 能引起我們自然地進入此狀態 於是我們四處找這樣的東西"}, {"zh-tw": " And this was a period of time when we failed tremendously. Ken Robinson is here. He talked about the glories of failure.", "en": " 那時就是我們遭遇極度失敗的階段 Ken Robinson 在這裡談到輝煌的失敗"}, {"zh-tw": " Well, we had a lot of them. We tried many different chemicals and agents, and we failed over and over again.", "en": " 我們也有過好多的輝煌失敗 我們試過很多的化學元素與機制 而一直是失敗接著失敗"}, {"zh-tw": " So, one time, I was at home watching television on the couch while my wife was putting our child to bed, and I was watching a television show.

It's really going to be OK.\" So that's kind of a tough day, but I said, \"There really is some basis for thinking why you might want to do this.\" As I said, this agent is in us, and, in fact, here's a curious thing, it binds to the very place inside of your cells where oxygen binds, and where you burn it, and that you do this burning to live.", "en": " 我想買些高濃度的 壓縮氣體鋼瓶 而且是致命氣體 就只因為我有這些想法 想要暫停人們的生命 而且 一定會成功的\" 可想而知 那時是相當難進行的 但我強調 有著強烈 的基本動機促使我們要做這樣研究 因為 那樣的機制(毒物)是存在體內的 更奇怪的是 硫化氫被用來做 在我們的細胞內 與氧氣 是同樣的鍵結方式 這樣的鍵結氧化燃燒 使細胞存活"}, {"zh-tw": " And so we thought, like in a game of musical chairs, might we be able to give a person some hydrogen sulfide, and might it be able to occupy that place like in a game of musical chairs where oxygen might bind? And because you can't bind the oxygen, maybe you wouldn't consume it, and then maybe it would reduce your demand for oxygen. I mean, who knows? So -- So, there's the bit about the dopamine and being a little bit, what do you call it, delusional, and you might suggest that was it.", "en": " 所以 我們聯想到 \"搶椅子遊戲\" 我們是否可以給人 一些 硫化氫 它 能取代 鍵結 就像搶椅子遊戲般 取代氧氣鍵結 因為細胞 不能連結氧氣 所以 不用氧化燃燒 也就降同時降低對氧氣的需求 我猜想的 所以 有些像多巴胺 或有些像是妄想 都是可被質疑的"}, {"zh-tw": " And so, we wanted to find out might we be able to use hydrogen sulfide in the presence of cold, and we wanted to see whether we could reproduce this skier in a mammal. Now, mammals are warm-blooded creatures, and when we get cold, we shake and we shiver, right? We try to keep our core temperature at 37 degrees by actually burning more oxygen.", "en": " 所以，我們要證實 或許利用 硫化氫再加上低溫環境 是不是能夠 於哺乳動物身上 再複製那滑雪者的情況 哺乳動物是溫血動物 遇到低溫 我們會發抖打顫 會儘量保持體內溫度於37度C 卻是藉由燃燒更多的 氧氣"}, {"zh-tw": " So, it was interesting for us when we applied hydrogen sulfide to a mouse when it was also cold because what happened is the core temperature of the mouse got cold. It stopped moving.", "en": " 對我們有趣的是 當我們使用硫化氫 在一低溫的老鼠身上 老鼠體溫下降 如環境溫度 它不再活動"}, {"zh-tw": " It appeared dead. Its oxygen consumption rate fell by tenfold.", "en": " 呈現死亡 而氧氣的消耗量 也降低十倍"}, {"zh-tw": " And here's the really important point. I told you hydrogen sulfide is in us.", "en": " 重要的事是這個 剛剛提到硫化氫是存在人體內"}, {"zh-tw": " It's rapidly metabolized, and all you have to do after six hours of being in this state of de-animation is simply put the thing out in room air, and it warms up, and it's none the worse for wear. Now, this was cosmic.", "en": " 快速的代謝 而處於暫停生命狀態六小時後 所要做的 僅只是恢復到正常室內空氣 它會恢復體內溫度 這是件大事"}, {"zh-tw": " Really. Because we had found a way to de-animate a mammal, and it didn't hurt it. Now, we'd found a way to reduce its oxygen consumption to rock-bottom levels, and it was fine.", "en": " 因為我們已找到 如何暫停哺乳動物的生命 也不至於 傷害它 我們已經找到降低 氧化消耗的速率 到其最低限度 也OK"}, {"zh-tw": " Now, in this state of de-animation, it could not go out dancing, but it was not dead, and it was not harmed. So we started to think: Is this the agent that might have been present in the skier, and might have she had more of it than someone else, and might that have been able to reduce her demand for oxygen before she got so cold that she otherwise would have died, as we found out with our worm experiments? So, we wondered: Can we do anything useful with this capacity to control metabolic flexibility? And one of the things we wondered -- I'm sure some of you out there are economists, and you know all about supply and demand.", "en": " 在這 暫停生命狀態 雖不能再活動 但它並未死去 一點都無其他傷害 所以我們開始思考:是不是這樣的機制 也就是使滑雪者存活的原因 還是她有著較常人還多的濃度 也就使她能降低 對氧的需求量 一切都得在她失溫之前達成 不然必死無疑 是根據我們的蟲蟲實驗? 我們在想: 我們是否能 利用這些已知 來控制代謝的彈性呢? 其中一件我們想解決的事 --- 我相信 你們當中一定有些是經濟學家 都明瞭 供給與需求"}, {"zh-tw": " And when supply is equal to demand, everything's fine, but when supply falls, in this case of oxygen, and demand stays high, you're dead. So, what I just told you is we can now reduce demand.", "en": " 當供給等於需求時 皆大歡喜 但當供給短缺 --- 在這裡就是 缺氧 --- 而需求依舊 那就死定了 剛剛在說明的重點 就是我們能降低對氧氣的需求"}, {"zh-tw": " We ought to be able to lower supply to unprecedented low levels without killing the animal. And with money we got from DARPA, we could show just that.", "en": " 我們必須降低供給 達到前所未有的程度 又不致死 利用從DARPA所支持的研究經費 我們已能驗證這些"}, {"zh-tw": " If you give mice hydrogen sulfide, you can lower their demand for oxygen, and you can put them into oxygen concentrations that are as low as 5,000 feet above the top of Mt. Everest, and they can sit there for hours, and there's no problem. Well this was really cool.", "en": " 如果我們給老鼠硫化氫 就能降低牠們對氧的需求 放置在氧氣濃度低於 5000英呎以上的Everest高山 牠們能停留數小時 沒有任何問題 這真的是非常棒"}, {"zh-tw": " We also found out that we could subject animals to otherwise lethal blood loss, and we could save them if we gave them hydrogen sulfide.
