And the first is pretty obvious.", "en": " 克里斯希望我分享幾個重要議題 因此我先講三個促成這個計畫的動機 第一個顯而易見"}, {"zh-tw": " It's amazing when you meeta head of state, and you say, \"What is your most preciousnatural resource?\" They will not say \"children\" at first, and then when you say, \"children,\"they will pretty quickly agree with you.

And that is that we all in this roomlearned how to walk, how to talk, not by being taught how to talk,or taught how to walk, but by interacting with the world, by having certain results as a consequenceof being able to ask for something, or being able to stand up and reach it.", "en": " 第三個動機比較不明顯 這跟所有人學會走路、說話的模式有關 沒人教我們如何說話或走路 但與外界互動後 自然就學會了 像是開口要求 物品就到了手裡 或是站起來 就搆得到物品"}, {"zh-tw": " Whereas at about the age six,we were told to stop learning that way, and that all learning from then onwould happen through teaching, whether it's people standing up,like I'm doing now, or a book, or something.

And that's why we will not launch this without five to 10 million unitsin the first run.", "en": " 您的要求實在有違敝公司的方針」 所以我回答：「喔，真可惜， 因為我們一年要一億台」 廠商口風一轉：「噢，我們的方針是可以調整的」 所以我才說規模至關重要 也因此 我們首批的需求至少要500到1000萬台"}, {"zh-tw": " And the idea isto launch with enough scale that the scale itselfhelps bring the price down, and that's why I saidseven to 10 million there.

None of those figure into our cost, because first of all, we sell it at cost,and the governments distribute it. It gets distributedto the school system like a textbook.", "en": " 這些我們都沒有 對不對？ 所以這些項目沒有列在成本裡 因為我們用成本價出售 政府負責流通 透過學校系統分送 像發課本一樣"}, {"zh-tw": " So that piece disappears. Then you have display and everything else.", "en": " 這些成本消失了 剩下的就是螢幕和其他部份"}, {"zh-tw": " Now the display on your laptop costs, in rough numbers,10 dollars a diagonal inch.

It's a little bit like an obese person having to use most of their energyto move their obesity.", "en": " 其他部分 棕色那一小塊 就有趣了 因為其他成本就是筆電運作所需 有點像過重的人 把大部分能量 都消耗在移動一身肥肉上 懂了吧？"}, {"zh-tw": " And we have a situation todaywhich is incredible. I've been using laptopssince their inception.", "en": " 我們現在的處境實在有點匪夷所思 我從筆電問世以來就開始用這東西了"}, {"zh-tw": " And my laptop runs slower,less reliably and less pleasantly than it ever has before.

And we've been going steadily downhill.", "en": " 運作順暢 現在的筆電一代不如一代"}, {"zh-tw": " Now, people ask all the time what it is. That's what it is.", "en": " 常有人問我筆電的規格 (WiFi網狀網路) 就是如此 (雙模式顯示器)"}, {"zh-tw": " The two pieces that are probably notable:it'll be a mesh network, so when the kids open up their laptops,they all become a network, and then just needone or two points of backhaul. You can serve a couple of thousand kidswith two megabits.", "en": " 其中最值得一提的應是網狀網路 孩子們同時使用筆電 就構成網路環境 只需要一兩個後置網路傳輸點 2MB的頻寬就夠滿足兩千個孩子"}, {"zh-tw": " So you really can bring into a village, and then the villagescan connect themselves, and you really can do it quite well.

Well, you can't see it.", "en": " 所以只要村內家家有筆電 整個村子就能聯成一個網路 效果非常好 雙模顯示 讓螢幕在戶外也能用 在戶外用手機有什麼問題？ 呃，你根本看不清楚螢幕"}, {"zh-tw": " And one of the reasons you can't see it is because it's backlightingmost of the time, most cell phones. Now, what we're doing is, we're doing onethat will be both frontlit and backlit.", "en": " 原因之一是 手機螢幕是背光式的 大部分手機都是如此 我們想做的 是正背光兩用的螢幕"}, {"zh-tw": " And whether you manually switch itor you do it in the software is to be seen. But when it's backlit, it's color.", "en": " 切換方式是手動還是用程式轉換還有待確認 反正 背光時 就是彩色螢幕"}, {"zh-tw": " And when it's frontlit,it's black and white at three times the resolution. Is it all worked out? No.", "en": " 面光時 是三倍解析度的黑白螢幕 這些都達成了嗎？還沒"}, {"zh-tw": " That's why a lot of our people aremore or less living in Taiwan right now. And in about 30 days,we'll know for sure whether this works.", "en": " 所以我們很多人員現在常跑台灣 大概30天後就會知道可不可行"}, {"zh-tw": " Probably the most important piece there is that the kidsreally can do the maintenance. And this is again somethingthat people don't believe, but I really think it's quite true.", "en": " 而最重要的部分 應該是孩子們可以負責維修工作 這是另一個不可思議之處 但這是千真萬確的 (兒童負責維修工作)"}, {"zh-tw": " That's the machine we showed in Tunis. This is more the directionthat we're going to go.", "en": " 這就是我們在突尼斯展示的筆電 這是未來設計的方向 (旋轉功能)"}, {"zh-tw": " And it's somethingthat we didn't think was possible. Now, I'm going to pass this around.", "en": " 之前以為這是做不到的 我現在把筆電傳下去"}, {"zh-tw": " This isn't a design, OK? So this is just a mechanicalengineering sort of embodiment of it for you to play with.
