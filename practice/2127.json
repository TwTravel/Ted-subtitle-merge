These islands — Mauritius,Rodrigues, and Réunion — along with the island of Madagascar, they are blessed with unique plants found nowhere else in the world.", "en": " 在世界上生物多樣性最豐富的地方工作 是我極大的榮幸 這個地方位於印度洋的馬斯克林群島 這些群島包括：模里西斯、羅德里格斯島和留尼旺群島 以及馬達加斯加島 這些島嶼有著獨一無二的植物 你在其他地方不可能找得到"}, {"zh-tw": " And today I will tell you about five of them and their particular features and why these plants are so unique. Take a look at this plant.", "en": " 今天我將向你們介紹其中五種植物 包括它們特殊的特徵 以及它們如此特別的原因 我們先來看看這種植物"}, {"zh-tw": " I call it benjoin in the local vernacular, and the botanical name is Terminalia bentzoe, subspecies bentzoe. This subspecies is endemic to Mauritius, and its particular feature is its heterophylly.", "en": " 當地人稱它為安息香 它的植物學名叫欖仁葉 是欖仁樹屬的次級種類 這種植物為模里西斯特有植物 而它的特徵就是 它的異形葉性"}, {"zh-tw": " What do I mean by heterophylly? It's that the same plant has got leaves that are different shapes and sizes. Now, these plants have evolved very far away from the mainland, and within specific ecosystems.", "en": " 什麼是異形葉性呢？ 就是指說在同一株植物中 有許多不同形狀和大小的葉子 如今這些植物都經過進化 已經遠離了大陸 而且只存在於特定的生態系中"}, {"zh-tw": " Often, these particular features have evolved as a response to the threat presented by the local fauna, in this case, grazing tortoises. Tortoises are known to have poor eyesight, and as such, they tend to avoid the plants they don't recognize.", "en": " 通常這些特徵 都進化為一種激烈反應 以此應對當地動物的威脅 在這裡指的就是食草性的陸龜 陸龜的視力很差 所以它們會盡量避免 那些它們無法辨認的植物"}, {"zh-tw": " So this evolutionary foil safeguards the plant against these rather cute animals, and protects it and of course ensures its survival. Now the question you're probably asking yourself is, why is she telling us all these stories? The reason for that is that we tend to overlook the diversity and the variety of the natural world.", "en": " 所以這種進化的葉子保護植物 防止它們被這類動物吃掉 也就更加確保其存活率 現在你心裡的疑問來了 她為何要說這些故事呢？ 原因是，我們常常忽略 自然世界中的多樣性"}, {"zh-tw": " These particular habitats are unique and they are host to a whole lot of plants. We don't realize how valuable and how precious these resources are, and yet, through our insouciance, we keep on destroying them.", "en": " 這些自然棲息地獨一無二 它們是無數植物賴以生長的家 我們沒有意識到 這些資源是多麼有價值且珍貴 我們甚至仍毫不在乎地 繼續破壞它們"}, {"zh-tw": " We're all familiar with the macro impact of urbanization, climate change, resource exploitation, but when that one last plant — or animal for that matter — when that very last specimen has disappeared from the face of this Earth, we would have lost an entire subset of the Earth's biology, and with it, important plants with medicinal potential or which could have ingredients that would speak to the cosmetic, nutrition, pharma, and even the ethno-veterinary sectors, be gone forever. And here we have a very prime example of the iconic dodo, which comes from Mauritius, and, of course, we know is now a symbol of extinction.", "en": " 我們都非常熟悉 城市化所帶來的巨大衝擊 氣候變遷、資源掠奪 但唯有當最後一種植物 或是最後一種動物 最後一個樣本 從地球上消失以後 我們就真的失去 一個完整的地球生物體系 在這套體系中有著潛在醫療價值的重要植物 或是植物中的成分 本來可以用於化妝品 營養品、製藥品 甚至是獸醫用的方針 都將消失而永不復見 這裡有個典型的例子 具有代表性的模里西斯渡渡鳥 當然，現在牠已是一個物種滅絕的象徵"}, {"zh-tw": " We know plants have a fundamental role to play. Well, first of all, they feed us and they also give us the oxygen we breathe, but plants are also the source of important, biologically active ingredients that we should be studying very carefully, because human societies over the millennia, they have developed important knowledge, cultural traditions, and important plant-based medicinal resources.", "en": " 我們都知道植物扮演著一個很重要的角色 首先，它是我們的食物 它們也提供我們呼吸的氧氣 而植物同時也提供很多 重要且具有生物活性的成分 因此值得我們仔細研究 因為人類社會經過幾千年 已經發展出許多重要的知識 不同的文化傳統 以及重要醫療用的植物資源"}, {"zh-tw": " Here's a data point: 1.4 percent of the entire land surface is home to 40 percent ofthe species of higher plants, 35 percent of the species of vertebrates, and this 1.4 percent represents the 25 biodiversity hotspots in the world, and this 1.4 percent of the entire land surface already provides for 35 percent of the ecosystem services that vulnerable people depend on.

Now, the local people, they used a decoction of the leaves against infectious diseases.", "en": " 現在，讓我們回去看 我給你們看的第一種植物 這個有著不同形狀和大小的葉子植物 欖仁葉 屬於欖仁樹屬的次級種類 是模里西斯所獨有的植物 現在，模里西斯的當地居民 他們用這種葉子煎藥 以治療感染疾病"}, {"zh-tw": " Now our work, that is, the scientific validation of this traditional information, has shown that precisely that leaf extract shows activity, potent activity, against a wide range of bacteria that could be pathogenic to humans.

From the scientific point of view, there are eight species of baobab in the world.", "en": " 如果部落裡面有什麼麻煩 他們就會和酋長或族人 在談判樹下碰面協商 就如同他們正一起努力 去解決那個特定的問題 這麼做也更加強化 部落之間彼此的信任和尊重 從科學的角度來看 世界上有八種不同種類的猴麵包樹"}, {"zh-tw": " There's one from Africa, one from Australia, and six are endemic to the island of Madagascar. The one I have showed you is the one from Africa, Adansonia digitata.", "en": " 一種來自非洲 一種來自澳洲 另外六種則是 馬達加斯加島的地方特有種 我給你們看的這種 是來自非洲的 叫做非洲猴麵包樹"}, {"zh-tw": " Now, the flower, this beautiful white flower, it opens at night, is pollinated by bats, and it gives rise to the fruit which is curiously known as the monkey apple. The monkeys are not stupid animals.", "en": " 現在這種漂亮的白花 它在夜晚綻放，經由蝙蝠受粉 最後結出果實 而很有創意地被稱為 猴蘋果 猴子非常聰明"}, {"zh-tw": " They know what's good for them.

And this is one of the reasons why the nutrition companies of this world, they are looking for this fruit to provide what we know as reinforced food.", "en": " 是的，你沒有聽錯 比人奶所含的蛋白質更豐富 這也是為什麼世界上 那些做營養品的公司 都積極尋找以獲取這類果實 以生產所謂的增強性食品"}, {"zh-tw": " The seeds give an oil, a very stable oil which is sought after by the cosmetic industry to give to produce body lotions, for example.

It's a complete plant, and in fact, the sheer size of these trees is hiding a massive potential, not only for the pharma, nutrition,and the cosmetic industry.", "en": " 現在你們可以明白為什麼 非洲人稱它為生命之樹了吧 它是一種完整的植物 而事實上光是這些樹的體型 就蘊藏著極大的開發潛力 不僅僅在醫療、營養與化妝產業"}, {"zh-tw": " What I have showed you here is only the species from Africa, Adansonia digitata.

Why should we, especially if you can afford it? And this gives you an indication of what the plant looks like before.", "en": " 的確，誰都不想變老 如果可以永保青春，為何要變老呢 這個是脫水的時候 這株植物的樣子"}, {"zh-tw": " Now, if you are an inexperienced gardener, the first thing you'll do when you visit the garden is to uproot this plant because it's dead.
