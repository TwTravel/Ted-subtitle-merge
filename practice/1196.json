The question is: why are we still in Afghanistan one decade later? Why are we spending $135 billion? Why have we got 130,000 troops on the ground? Why were more people killed last month than in any preceding month of this conflict? How has this happened? The last 20 years has been the age of intervention, and Afghanistan is simply one act in a five-act tragedy. We came out of the end of the Cold War in despair.", "en": " 今天的問題不是: 我們為什麼侵略阿富汗? 而是 我們為什麼還待在那裡? 十年之後? 我們為什麼要花 135億美元 我們為什麼要有13萬軍隊部屬在戰爭現場 為什麼有更多人死去 上個月 比之前任何一個月都多 因為這個戰爭? 為什麼會這樣? 最後20年 是干預的年代 而阿富汗只是其中一個行動 在一個接連5個行動的悲劇 我們絕望地從冷戰末期 走出"}, {"zh-tw": " We faced Rwanda; we faced Bosnia, and then we rediscovered our confidence. In the third act, we went into Bosnia and Kosovo and we seemed to succeed.", "en": " 我們面對過盧安達(種族)大屠殺 我們面對波士尼亞(瑟布雷尼卡)屠殺事件 然後我們重拾信心 在第三個行動中，我們進入波士尼亞和科索沃 最終我們似乎成功了"}, {"zh-tw": " In the fourth act, with our hubris, our overconfidence developing, we invaded Iraq and Afghanistan, and in the fifth act, we plunged into a humiliating mess. So the question is: What are we doing? Why are we still stuck in Afghanistan? And the answer, of course, that we keep being given is as follows: we're told that we went into Afghanistan because of 9/11, and that we remain there because the Taliban poses an existential threat to global security.", "en": " 在第四個行動中，我們以驕傲的心態， 變得越來越過度自信 我們侵略了伊拉克和阿富汗 在第五個行動中 我們慘陷令人不堪的泥诏 所以，我們在幹嘛? 為什麼我們還陷在阿富汗? 當然這個答案 提供我們的一直是 如下 我們被告知去阿富汗 是因為911恐怖攻擊 而我們之所以還待在這裡 是因為塔利班的存在 對全球安全帶來了威脅"}, {"zh-tw": " In the words of President Obama, \"If the Taliban take over again, they will invite back Al-Qaeda, who will try to kill as many of our people as they possibly can.\" The story that we're told is that there was a \"light footprint\" initially -- in other words, that we ended up in a situation where we didn't have enough troops, we didn't have enough resources, that Afghans were frustrated -- they felt there wasn't enough progress and economic development and security, and therefore the Taliban came back -- that we responded in 2005 and 2006 with troop deployments, but we still didn't put enough troops on the ground. And that it wasn't until 2009, when President Obama signed off on a surge, that we finally had, in the words of Secretary Clinton, \"the strategy, the leadership and the resources.\" So, as the president now reassures us, we are on track to achieve our goals.", "en": " 歐巴馬總統多次談到 如果塔利班捲土重來 他們將會迎回蓋達組織 這組織將盡他們所能 試著殺死我們的人民 我們被告知的說法 是我們最初只是輕輕地踏上那土地 換句話說，我們的結局反而造成了 我們並沒有足夠的軍力 我們沒有足夠的資源 使阿富汗人民很沮喪 他們感覺不到足夠的進展 經濟發展和安全 因此塔利班才會回來 2005年和2006年之間 我們部屬了軍隊 但數量依然不足夠 一直到2009年 當歐巴馬總統在波濤洶湧的情勢下批准後 我們才終於有了 套句美國國務卿希拉克林頓的話 策略，領導精神和資源 所以，當總統又再次向我們保證 我們正走在實現目標的正軌上時"}, {"zh-tw": " All of this is wrong.

How? Well first see, if you put 125 billion dollars a year into a country like Afghanistan where the entire revenue of the Afghan state is one billion dollars a year, you drown everything. It's not simply corruption and waste that you create; you essentially replace the priorities of the Afghan government, the elected Afghan government, with the micromanaging tendencies of foreigners on short tours with their own priorities.", "en": " 但是當我們開始帶來更多金錢 開始投資更多資源時 事情沒變好卻更糟。 怎麼這樣? 嗯 首先 如果你一年投入125億元 在像阿富汗這樣的國家上 整個國家財政收入 一年才一億元 那就是像石沉大海 你造成的不只是 貪汙和浪費 你根本上替換了阿富汗政府的執政重點 那個被選出來的政府 而傾向由短期旅居的外國人 隨著他們的喜好 管東管西"}, {"zh-tw": " And the same is true for the troops.

So the idea that we deployed the troops to respond to the Taliban insurgency is mistaken.", "en": " 現在他再也不能這樣做了 所以我們想部屬軍隊 來回應塔利班的暴亂 是錯的"}, {"zh-tw": " Rather than preceding the insurgency, the Taliban followed the troop deployment, and as far as I'm concerned, the troop deployment caused their return.

No, there have been any number of people saying this over the last seven years.", "en": " 不但沒有早於暴亂發生之前 塔利班還接著軍隊部屬後而來 就我所知 軍對部屬導致他們重返 難道這是個新的想法嗎? 不，在過去七年裡 很多人一直提出這個想法"}, {"zh-tw": " I ran a center at Harvard from 2008 to 2010, and there were people like Michael Semple there who speak Afghan languages fluently, who've traveled to almost every district in the country.

It didn't.
