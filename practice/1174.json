And for most of those years, I worried about, how am I going to sell more cars and trucks? But today I worry about, what if all we do is sell more cars and trucks? What happens when the number of vehicles on the road doubles, triples, or even quadruples? My life is guided by two great passions, and the first is automobiles.", "en": " 既是上帝的安排也是自我的選擇 終其一生，我都與汽車行業有著不解之緣 30年來 我一直在福特汽車公司工作 在這期間 我擔心得最多的是 怎樣才能把更多的轎車卡車賣出去 現在我最擔心的是 我們一直這麼做的話會有什麽後果呢 如果路上的車輛 翻了一倍，兩倍，三倍，甚至四倍 會有什麽後果 我的生命被兩種強大的熱情左右著 第一就是汽車"}, {"zh-tw": " I literally grew up with the Ford Motor Company. I thought it was so cool as a little boy when my dad would bring home the latest Ford or Lincoln and leave it in the driveway.", "en": " 事實上，我是隨福特公司一同成長的 我還是個小孩的時候 爸爸偶爾會把最新款的福特或林肯汽車開回家，停在門前的大道上 這真是太酷了"}, {"zh-tw": " And I decided about that time, about age 10, that it would be really cool if I was a test driver. So my parents would go to dinner.", "en": " 那時的我大概10歲 我想，如果能當上汽車試駕員，該有多好啊 於是趁父母去吃晚飯"}, {"zh-tw": " They'd sit down; I'd sneak out of the house. I'd jump behind the wheel and take the new model around the driveway, and it was a blast.", "en": " 他們坐下了，我就偷溜出去 跳上駕駛座，把新傢伙開上車道到處趴趴走 太過癮了"}, {"zh-tw": " And that went on for about two years, until -- I think I was about 12 -- my dad brought home a Lincoln Mark III. And it was snowing that day.", "en": " 我就這麼玩了兩年 直到--我大概12歲-- 有一天我爸爸把一台林肯 III 開回家 那天正好在下雪"}, {"zh-tw": " So he and mom went to dinner, and I snuck out and thought it'd be really cool to do donuts or even some figure-eights in the snow. My dad finished dinner early that evening.", "en": " 他和媽媽去吃晚飯 我溜了出去 我覺得（開車）在雪上畫0字型 或8字型肯定特別好玩 但那晚爸爸的晚飯時間比往常要少"}, {"zh-tw": " And he was walking to the front hall and out the front door just about the same time I hit some ice and met him at the front door with the car -- and almost ended up in the front hall. So it kind of cooled my test-driving for a little while.", "en": " 他走向客廳 正要出門 我就在這時不巧撞到了冰 在大門口和他撞了個正著 還差點沖進了客廳 這一度讓我不想做試駕員了"}, {"zh-tw": " But I really began to love cars then. And my first car was a 1975 electric-green Mustang.", "en": " 但從此以後，我就開始為車瘋狂了 我第一台車是1975年的電光綠野馬"}, {"zh-tw": " And even though the color was pretty hideous, I did love the car, and it really cemented my love affair with cars that's continued on to this day. But cars are really more than a passion of mine; they're quite literally in my blood.", "en": " 儘管顏色真的很難看 但我相當喜歡它 它堅定了我對車狂熱的愛好 這種熱情也延續至今 但汽車不只是作為我的熱情存在的 我和它的緣分是與生俱來的"}, {"zh-tw": " My great grandfather was Henry Ford, and on my mother's side, my great grandfather was Harvey Firestone.

My other great passion is the environment.", "en": " 這也是我一直堅信的 我的另一樣熱情是環保"}, {"zh-tw": " And as a young boy, I used to go up to Northern Michigan and fish in the rivers that Hemingway fished in and then later wrote about.

As a high-schooler, I started to read authors like Thoreau and Aldo Leopold and Edward Abbey, and I really began to develop a deeper appreciation of the natural world.", "en": " 雖然當時很年輕 我的內心卻被深深撼動了 保護環境的意識 在我心中油然而生 上高中以後，我開始讀 梭羅，奧爾多·利奧波德，愛德華•艾比 等作家的書 我開始對自然界 產生了一種更深層的仰慕"}, {"zh-tw": " But it never really occurred to me that my love of cars and trucks would ever be in conflict with nature. And that was true until I got to college.", "en": " 但我從未想過 我摯愛的汽車竟然會 與自然界背道而馳 直到上大學 我都是這麼認為的"}, {"zh-tw": " And when I got to college, you can imagine my surprise when I would go to class and a number of my professors would say that Ford Motor Company and my family was everything that was wrong with our country. They thought that we were more interested, as an industry, in profits, rather than progress, and that we filled the skies with smog -- and frankly, we were the enemy.", "en": " 當我上了大學，你們可以想像我有多吃驚 因為我上課時 許多教授都會譴責說 福特公司，包括我的家庭 所做的一切都與國家發展背道而馳 他們認為我們這個行業 更重視盈利，而不是發展 我們讓天空充滿廢氣 再直白一點就是，我們是敵人"}, {"zh-tw": " I joined Ford after college, after some soul searching whether or not this is really the right thing to do. But I decided that I wanted to go and see if I could affect change there.", "en": " 畢業後，我進入了福特 我思來想去 這是否是最佳的選擇 但最終我決定去嘗試 看看我能不能改變它的形象"}, {"zh-tw": " And as I look back over 30 years ago, it was a little naive to think at that age that I could. But I wanted to. And I really discovered that my professors weren't completely wrong.", "en": " 回過頭看30年前的自己 那時我很自信很天真 可我非常想這麼做 然後我發現 教授的話也有一定道理"}, {"zh-tw": " In fact, when I got back to Detroit, my environmental leanings weren't exactly embraced by those in my own company, and certainly by those in the industry. I had some very interesting conversations, as you can imagine.", "en": " 實際上，我回到底特律以後 我提出的環保想法 並沒有被公司員工所接受 更別說同行的公司了 我經歷過一些挺有趣的談話 你們可以想像了到"}, {"zh-tw": " There were some within Ford who believed that all this ecological nonsense should just disappear and that I needed to stop hanging out with \"environmental wackos.\" I was considered a radical. And I'll never forget the day I was called in by a member of top management and told to stop associating with any known or suspected environmentalists.", "en": " 在福特公司有些人認為 這種環保的想法全是胡扯 不該存在的 而我不應該 再與那些“環保主義怪人”為伍 我被視為激進分子了 我永遠不會忘記，那天，我被一名高層叫過去 說我不可以再跟那些 環保主義分子有任何關係"}, {"zh-tw": " Of course, I had no intention of doing that, and I kept speaking out about the environment, and it really was the topic that we now today call sustainability. And in time, my views went from controversial to more or less consensus today.", "en": " 我當然沒有這麼做 我還是倡導環保 而我所謂的環保 就是今天所說的永續發展 最終我的想法從當时的備受爭議 變成了大家如今的共識"}, {"zh-tw": " I mean, I think most people in the industry understand that we've got to get on with it. And the good news is today we are tackling the big issues, of cars and the environment -- not only at Ford, but really as an industry.", "en": " 就是說，我想汽車行業的每個人 都知道我們需要採取措施了 好消息是，我們已經開始解決這些關於 汽車及環保的重要問題 不僅是福特公司，整個行業都在努力"}, {"zh-tw": " We're pushing fuel efficiency to new heights. And with new technology, we're reducing -- and I believe, someday we'll eliminate -- CO2 emissions.", "en": " 我們把能源效率提升到一個新的至高點 透過新技術 我們正在減少CO2排放，並且相信有天我們會 把它完全消除"}, {"zh-tw": " We're starting to sell electric cars, which is great. We're developing alternative powertrains that are going to make cars affordable in every sense of the word -- economically, socially and environmentally.", "en": " 我們開始銷售電能車，這是個很好的點子 我們在開發替代能源 這將降低製造和使用汽車 所付出的代價 不管是經濟上，社會上 還是環境方面"}, {"zh-tw": " And actually, although we've got a long way to go and a lot of work to do, I can see the day where my two great passions -- cars and the environment -- actually come into harmony. But unfortunately, as we're on our way to solving one monstrous problem -- and as I said, we're not there yet; we've got a lot of work to do, but I can see where we will -- but even as we're in the process of doing that, another huge problem is looming, and people aren't noticing.", "en": " 的確，我們還有很長的路要走 很多困難需要克服 但我堅信，我生命中那兩種執著的熱情 汽車與環保 相互融合的那天並不遙遠 不幸的是 雖然我們正在著手解决這個可怕的問題 我說過，我們現在還面臨著很多困難 可我知道我們會成功 在我們努力的同時 另一個大問題也浮出水面了 一個近乎被忽視的問題"}, {"zh-tw": " And that is the freedom of mobility that my great grandfather brought to people is now being threatened, just as the environment is. The problem, put in its simplest terms, is one of mathematics.", "en": " 那就是自由移動 這是我曾祖父最先所提出的 可現在它正和自然一樣，面臨著威脅 簡單來說，這是一個 數學性的問題"}, {"zh-tw": " Today there are approximately 6.8 billion people in the world, and within our lifetime, that number's going to grow to about nine billion.

When we look at the population growth in terms of cars, it becomes even clearer.", "en": " 人口急劇增長 也帶來了日益嚴峻的實際問題 其中一個就是交通問題 可以說，這是我們的交通體系完全無法承載的 如果從汽車數量的角度來看人口增長 結論就更明顯了"}, {"zh-tw": " Today there are about 800 million cars on the road worldwide. But with more people and greater prosperity around the world, that number's going to grow to between two and four billion cars by mid century.", "en": " 目前全球共有約8億台汽車 但隨著人數增加 和全球財富的不斷增長 汽車數量必定會增加 在本世紀中期，全球會有20-40億台汽車"}, {"zh-tw": " And this is going to create the kind of global gridlock that the world has never seen before. Now think about the impact that this is going to have on our daily lives.", "en": " 這可能造成史無前例的 全球性交通癱瘓 請想想這會給我們 日常生活帶來怎樣的影響"}, {"zh-tw": " Today the average American spends about a week a year stuck in traffic jams, and that's a huge waste of time and resources. But that's nothing compared to what's going on in the nations that are growing the fastest.", "en": " 在今天，美國平均每人 每年會有一個星期 是在交通堵塞中度過的 這可是對時間和資源的極大浪費 可是，相比之下 在某些飛速發展的國家 美國這點問題就變得微不足道了"}, {"zh-tw": " Today the average driver in Beijing has a five-hour commute.

So you can see the size of the issue that we're facing.", "en": " 在未來的幾十年中 世界75%的人口將會 居住在城市 這其中將有50個城市 人口過億 可見我們所面臨的問題有多大"}, {"zh-tw": " When you factor in population growth, it's clear that the mobility model that we have today simply will not work tomorrow. Frankly, four billion clean cars on the road are still four billion cars, and a traffic jam with no emissions is still a traffic jam.", "en": " 考慮人口增長的話，我們可以 清楚地知道，現行的交通模式根本無法 在未來沿用 說到底，即便變成40億環保汽車 還是有這麼多車在路上 即便是無污染的交通堵塞 也改變不了癱瘓的交通"}, {"zh-tw": " So, if we make no changes today, what does tomorrow look like? Well I think you probably already have the picture. Traffic jams are just a symptom of this challenge, and they're really very, very inconvenient, but that's all they are.", "en": " 因此，如果我們今天不採取措施 明天會怎樣 我想結局大家都能料到吧 塞車現象只是我們所面臨的挑戰中的 一個小小癥候，他們真的很不方便 但也不會有什麽嚴重後果"}, {"zh-tw": " But the bigger issue is that global gridlock is going to stifle economic growth and our ability to deliver food and health care, particularly to people that live in city centers.

Well the answer isn't going to be more of the same. My great grandfather once said before he invented the Model T, \"If I had asked people then what they wanted, they would have answered, 'We want faster horses.'\" So the answer to more cars is simply not to have more roads.", "en": " 那麼我們要怎麼做呢 我們不能再用以前的方式了 我曾祖父在發明T型汽車前 對我說 “如果我問過去的人他們要什麽 他們會說 我們要跑得更快的馬” 所以更多的道路 並不能解決這個問題"}, {"zh-tw": " When America began moving west, we didn't add more wagon trains, we built railroads.

It's a system that really ties together all the transportation assets into a single payment system.", "en": " 再看看香港 他們創建了一個有趣的系統叫“八達通” 通過“八達通” 所有交通費用 都可方便地支付"}, {"zh-tw": " So parking garages, buses, trains, they all operate within the same system. Now shared car services are also springing up around the world, and these efforts, I think, are great.", "en": " 停車場，公車，火車 都是在同一個系統下運轉的 現在共用汽車服務 在世界各位都蓬勃發展起來了 我認為這些嘗試棒極了"}, {"zh-tw": " They're relieving congestion, and they're frankly starting to save some fuel. These are all really good ideas that will move us forward.", "en": " 這樣可以減輕堵塞 也可以減少燃料的消耗 這些都是很好的想法 使我們不斷進步的想法"}, {"zh-tw": " But what really inspires me is what's going to be possible when our cars can begin talking to each other.
