Headlines that look like this when they have to do with climate change, and headlines that look like this when they have to do with air quality or smog."}, {"zh-tw": "以上兩種新聞內容分別屬於大氣科學的兩個分支這是最近的一則頭條，內容是說IPCC...也就是聯合國的\"政府間氣候變化專門委員會\"發表了一篇關於大氣系統現況的報告", "en": "They are both two branches of the same field of atmospheric science. Recently the headlines looked like this when the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC, put out their report on the state of understanding of the atmospheric system."}, {"zh-tw": "這篇報告是由來自40個國家的620位科學家合力完成整篇報告將近一千頁", "en": "That report was written by 620 scientists from 40 countries. They wrote almost a thousand pages on the topic."}, {"zh-tw": "然後再經由另外來自113個國家的400多位科學家和審查員審定而成這可是個浩大工程事實上，我們每年的聚會可說是物理學界的年度盛事", "en": "And all of those pages were reviewed by another 400-plus scientists and reviewers, from 113 countries. It's a big community. It's such a big community, in fact, that our annual gathering is the largest scientific meeting in the world."}, {"zh-tw": "每年會有超過一萬五千名科學家齊聚於舊金山每個人都代表一個研究團隊也代表每個團隊的研究議題", "en": "Over 15,000 scientists go to San Francisco every year for that. And every one of those scientists is in a research group, and every research group studies a wide variety of topics."}, {"zh-tw": "我們在劍橋的團隊，研究議題非常多樣像是影響天氣與氣候的聖嬰現象人造衛星的數據同化或是我正在研究的農作物與生化燃料而在每個研究領域裡都有許多跟我一樣的博士生每人負責一個專精的主題專精到像是小小的反應過程，或一些小分子", "en": "For us at Cambridge, it's as varied as the El Niño oscillation, which affects weather and climate, to the assimilation of satellite data, to emissions from crops that produce biofuels, which is what I happen to study. And in each one of these research areas, of which there are even more, there are PhD students, like me, and we study incredibly narrow topics, things as narrow as a few processes or a few molecules."}, {"zh-tw": "我研究的是名叫異戊二烯的分子，如螢幕所示這是種微小的有機分子，你們可能從來沒聽過一個迴紋針的重量大約等於10的21次方個異戊二烯分子", "en": "And one of the molecules I study is called isoprene, which is here. It's a small organic molecule. You've probably never heard of it. The weight of a paper clip is approximately equal to 900 zeta-illion -- 10 to the 21st -- molecules of isoprene."}, {"zh-tw": "雖然它非常輕但它每年排放到大氣中的量卻相當於地球上所有人的體重總和這可不是團小東西，跟甲烷的重量比起來也不相上下", "en": "But despite its very small weight, enough of it is emitted into the atmosphere every year to equal the weight of all the people on the planet. It's a huge amount of stuff. It's equal to the weight of methane."}, {"zh-tw": "正因如此，它在大氣系統中扮演了至關重要的角色我們會不遺餘力地研究異戊二烯理由也在此", "en": "And because it's so much stuff, it's really important for the atmospheric system. Because it's important to the atmospheric system, we go to all lengths to study this thing."}, {"zh-tw": "我們將它炸裂並觀察它遺留的碎片這是位於西班牙的EUPHORE煙霧實驗室", "en": "We blow it up and look at the pieces. This is the EUPHORE Smog Chamber in Spain."}, {"zh-tw": "大氣中的完全燃燒所產生的爆炸次數是車子引擎裡的一千五百倍即使如此，我們仍致力於觀察它的碎片", "en": "Atmospheric explosions, or full combustion, takes about 15,000 times longer than what happens in your car. But still, we look at the pieces."}, {"zh-tw": "我們會用超級電腦運算大量的模型我目前在做的就是這個模型裡有上千個網格在運算每分鐘能運算上百筆數據", "en": "We run enormous models on supercomputers; this is what I happen to do. Our models have hundreds of thousands of grid boxes calculating hundreds of variables each, on minute timescales."}, {"zh-tw": "而整合這些數據則花費了數週時間整合次數也不計其數耗費那麼多心力只為了更瞭解異戊二烯", "en": "And it takes weeks to perform our integrations. And we perform dozens of integrations in order to understand what's happening."}, {"zh-tw": "此外，我們也在世界各地尋找這種分子最近我參加了一個在馬來西亞的實地調查活動", "en": "We also fly all over the world looking for this thing. I recently joined a field campaign in Malaysia. There are others."}, {"zh-tw": "我們還在當地建立了一個全球大氣觀測站就位在雨林中央，上面懸掛了許多昂貴的科學儀器價值約數十萬美元都是為了尋找異戊二烯當然，也順便觀察其他種類的分子這就是那座觀測站，照片是從飛機上拍的", "en": "We found a global atmospheric watchtower there, in the middle of the rainforest, and hung hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of scientific equipment off this tower, to look for isoprene, and of course, other things while we were there. This is the tower in the middle of the rainforest, from above."}, {"zh-tw": "這張是從底下拍的我們還從FAAM借來了一架BA146飛機進行觀測", "en": "And this is the tower from below. And on part of that field campaign we even brought an aircraft with us."}, {"zh-tw": "(譯註：FAAM是英國一家提供大氣觀測機的機構)這種飛機載客量約120到130人也許有人今天就是乘坐類似的飛機來到這裡的", "en": "And this plane, the model, BA146, which was run by FAAM, normally flies 120 to 130 people. So maybe you took a similar aircraft to get here today."}, {"zh-tw": "但我們是以距離樹冠層僅一百公尺的高度在飛行非常危險，但這都是為了測量異戊二烯為了進行測量，飛機必須以一特定角度飛行", "en": "But we didn't just fly it. We were flying at 100 meters above the top of the canopy to measure this molecule -- incredibly dangerous stuff. We have to fly at a special incline in order to make the measurements."}, {"zh-tw": "所以我們請來了軍方和測試飛行員來駕駛飛機當然，特殊的飛行許可也是不可少的", "en": "We hire military and test pilots to do the maneuvering. We have to get special flight clearance."}, {"zh-tw": "當飛機沿著河谷飛過時，G力會達到2G科學家們必須完全承受住這些壓力因為他們還要在飛機上進行測量事宜", "en": "And as you come around the banks in these valleys, the forces can get up to two Gs. And the scientists have to be completely harnessed in in order to make measurements while they're on board."}, {"zh-tw": "所以，各位應該可以想像飛機上的狀況絕對不會像要去度假一樣悠閒對我們而言，那就像個空中實驗室", "en": "So, as you can imagine, the inside of this aircraft doesn't look like any plane you would take on vacation. It's a flying laboratory that we took to make measurements in the region of this molecule."}, {"zh-tw": "以上就是我們為了瞭解一個化學分子所做的努力只要有某個學生像我一樣特別執著於某一種分子或對某一種分子有著深入了解他們就會把自己的想法寫成一篇篇的論文", "en": "We do all of this to understand the chemistry of one molecule. And when one student like me has some sort of inclination or understanding about that molecule, they write one scientific paper on the subject."}, {"zh-tw": "藉由一個實地調查活動，我們可以瞭解許多分子許許多多的研究論文便應運而生我們的知識體系便由此而建構進而衍生出更進一步的研究與探索這些研究結果於是成為IPCC評估報告的構成要素", "en": "And out of that field campaign we'll probably get a few dozen papers on a few dozen processes or molecules. And as a body of knowledge builds up, it will form one subsection, or one sub-subsection of an assessment like the IPCC, although we have others."}, {"zh-tw": "在報告書的十一個章節裡頭每章都有六到十小節闡述進一步的研究成果所以各位可以想像，科學家們為此付出了多少心力", "en": "And each one of the 11 chapters of the IPCC has six to ten subsections. So you can imagine the scale of the effort."}, {"zh-tw": "報告完成之後，我們會將報告書的內容...整理成一篇摘要以提供給非專業領域的大眾閱讀最後我們把這篇摘要交給記者以及政府的決策官員報紙上的頭條新聞便由此而生", "en": "In each one of those assessments that we write, we always tag on a summary, and the summary is written for a non-scientific audience. And we hand that summary to journalists and policy makers, in order to make headlines like these."}, {"zh-tw": "謝謝大家", "en": "Thank you very much."}], "title": "Rachel Pike The Science Behind A Climate Headline"}
