Now, I read Peter Singer's book in 1980, when I had a full headof lush, brown hair, and indeed I was moved by it, because I had become a lawyer becauseI wanted to speak for the voiceless, defend the defenseless, and I'd never realized how voicelessand defenseless the trillions, billions of nonhuman animals are.", "en": " 在 2000 年時印度最高法院 裁定錫克教的聖典是法人； 而就在最近的 2012 年 紐西蘭原住民和君權政府之間的公約 認可了一條河流是法人， 它擁有著自己的河床。 我在 1980 年時拜讀過「彼得．辛格」的著作， 當時我有著滿頭茂盛的棕髮， 而深深被這本書感動， 因為我成為律師就是為了來替弱勢者出聲、 為無力辯護的人來辯護； 而我從來不知道有多如牛毛的非人類動物 是沒有聲音的、無力辯護的，"}, {"zh-tw": " And I began to workas an animal protection lawyer.

James Somerset was an eight-year-old boywhen he was kidnapped from West Africa.", "en": " 我對該案件深感興趣，我最終還為此寫了一整本書。 詹姆斯．桑默塞特在西非遭到綁架時年僅八歲，"}, {"zh-tw": " He survived the Middle Passage, and he was sold to a Scottish businessmannamed Charles Stewart in Virginia.

And so in the fall of 1771, James Somerset had a confrontationwith Charles Stewart.", "en": " 所以他所做的第一件事便是受洗， 目的是為了得到一對教父、母； 對一個十八世紀的奴隸來說 他們知道教父的一個重責大任就是幫助你脫逃。 而在 1771 年的秋天， 詹姆斯和查爾斯起了衝突，"}, {"zh-tw": " We don't know exactly what happened,but then James dropped out of sight. An enraged Charles Stewartthen hired slave catchers to canvass the city of London, find him, bring himnot back to Charles Stewart, but to a ship, the Ann and Mary,that was floating in London Harbour, and he was chained to the deck, and the ship was to set sail for Jamaica where James was to be soldin the slave markets and be doomed to the three to fiveyears of life that a slave had harvesting sugar cane in Jamaica.", "en": " 我們也不知道到底是發生了什麼事，不過後來詹姆斯消失不見了。 盛怒的查爾斯隨後雇用了獵奴人查訪倫敦市， 找出他、帶他回泊留在倫敦港的「安與瑪莉號」船上 而非帶回給查爾斯； 而且他被鏈鎖在甲板上， 該船預定要航向牙買加， 在那裡詹姆斯即將在奴隸市場被賣掉， 他被註定了奴隸在牙買加會有的日子三到五年裡不停收割甘蔗。"}, {"zh-tw": " Well now James' godparentsswung into action. They approached the most powerful judge, Lord Mansfield, who was chief judgeof the court of King's Bench, and they demanded that he issuea common law writ of habeus corpus on behalf of James Somerset.", "en": " 不錯，當下詹姆斯的教父、母迅速有所行動， 找上了最權威的法官 － 「曼斯菲爾德」大法官，其為「王座法庭」的首席法官。 他們代表詹姆士要求他簽發人身保護令普通法傳票。"}, {"zh-tw": " Now, the common law is the kind of lawthat English-speaking judges can make when they're not cabined inby statutes or constitutions, and a writ of habeus corpusis called the Great Writ, capital G, capital W, and it's meant to protect any of uswho are detained against our will. A writ of habeus corpus is issued.", "en": " 普通法是當未被法令或是憲法所納入 英語系國家的法官可以制訂法條的法律； 而人身保護令傳票叫做「大令狀」， 旨在保護我們誰違反自身意願遭受拘禁的任何人。 一旦人身保護令傳票被簽發，"}, {"zh-tw": " The detainer is requiredto bring the detainee in and give a legally sufficient reasonfor depriving him of his bodily liberty. Well, Lord Mansfield had to makea decision right off the bat, because if James Somersetwas a legal thing, he was not eligiblefor a writ of habeus corpus, only if he could be a legal person.", "en": " 拘禁人受命帶來受拘禁者到庭上 並且給出剝奪其身體自由在法律上的充分理由。 好了，曼斯菲爾德大法官必須即刻做出決定， 因為詹姆士是「法律上的物品」 他不合乎於人身保護令傳票的用途， 除非他可以是個法人。"}, {"zh-tw": " So Lord Mansfield decidedthat he would assume, without deciding, that James Somersetwas indeed a legal person, and he issued the writ of habeus corpus,and James's body was brought in by the captain of the ship. There were a series of hearingsover the next six months.", "en": " 所以曼斯菲爾德大法官決定 －他將會假定而不是裁定 詹姆斯確實是個法人， 他簽發了人身保護令傳票，詹姆士人就被該船船長帶來法庭上。 接下來六個月內有一連串的聽證會。"}, {"zh-tw": " On June 22, 1772, Lord Mansfieldsaid that slavery was so odious, and he used the word \"odious,\" that the common law would not support it,and he ordered James free. At that moment, James Somersetunderwent a legal transubstantiation.", "en": " 1772 年 6 月 22 日曼斯菲爾德大法官直言奴隸制度是如此醜惡， 他用了「醜惡」這個字眼， 這下普通法不會再助長它的，他發出釋放詹姆士的命令。 在那一刻詹姆斯經歷了法律上的轉形，"}, {"zh-tw": " The free man who walkedout of the courtroom looked exactly like the slavewho had walked in, but as far as the law was concerned,they had nothing whatsoever in common. The next thing we did is thatthe Nonhuman Rights Project, which I founded, then began to look atwhat kind of values and principles do we want to put before the judges? What values and principlesdid they imbibe with their mother's milk, were they taught in law school,do they use every day, do they believe with all their hearts --and we chose liberty and equality.", "en": " 走出法庭這個自由的男人 看起來和走進法庭的奴隸完全相像， 不過就法律層面而言他倆已經沒有任何相同之處了。 我所成立的 「非人類權利專案」所做的下一件事情是 接著開始著眼於我們想放在法官面前的是什麼樣的價值觀和原則， 哪些價值觀和原則對他們來說再自然不過？ 在法學院裡有上過？每天都會用到？他們打從心底相信？ 而我們選中「自由」和「平等」。"}, {"zh-tw": " Now, liberty right is the kind of rightto which you're entitled because of how you're put together, and a fundamental liberty rightprotects a fundamental interest. And the supreme interest in the common law are the rights to autonomyand self-determination.", "en": " 如今自由之權是那種因為你的外觀所被賦予的權利， 而基本的自由權保護基本的利益。 普通法至高的利益 是自主和自決的權力。"}, {"zh-tw": " So they are so powerful thatin a common law country, if you go to a hospital and you refuselife-saving medical treatment, a judge will not order it forced upon you, because they will respectyour self-determination and your autonomy. Now, an equality right is the kindof right to which you're entitled because you resemble someone elsein a relevant way, and there's the rub, relevant way.", "en": " 所以這兩種權利非常強大， 在普通法國家要是你進了醫院而拒絕了保命的醫療救治， 法官不會下令使其強加於你身上， 因為他們會尊重你的自決和自主權。 平等權是那種因為你很某人在有關方面 看起來很相像而你所被賦予的權利， 這裡有一個關卡 － 相關方面；"}, {"zh-tw": " So if you are that, then becausethey have the right, you're like them, you're entitled to the right. Now, courts and legislaturesdraw lines all the time.", "en": " 所以要是你是那樣，然後因為他們有權利、你和他們相像， 你就被賦予了該權力。 如今法院和立法機構不時劃分出界限，"}, {"zh-tw": " Some are included, some are excluded. But you have to,at the bare minimum you must -- that line has to be a reasonable meansto a legitimate end.", "en": " 有些人被包含在內、有些人排除在外。 但是在最低限度你一定要、你得要 － 那條線對合法性的目標來說得要是合理的方式，"}, {"zh-tw": " The Nonhuman Rights Projectargues that drawing a line in order to enslave an autonomousand self-determining being like you're seeing behind me, that that's a violation of equality.

It's the thing that we doto our worst criminals, and we do that to chimpanzeeswithout even thinking about it.", "en": " 他們能夠預測明天。 這是為什麼關住一隻黑猩猩，尤其是單獨一隻有多麼駭人； 這是我們對罪大惡極的人犯所作之事， 而我們對黑猩猩們做這檔事連想都沒有想過這點！"}, {"zh-tw": " They have some kind of moral capacity.
