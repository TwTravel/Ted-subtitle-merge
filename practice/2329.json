It all happened for me about 30 years agowhen I was in graduate school, and a bunch of us graduate studentsgot together one day, and we said, you know,there's an explosion of writing and thinkingin feminist theory, but there's no courses yet.", "en": " 但我並非一直都是中產階級的白人男性。 這件事是大約30年前我在讀研究所時發生的， 有一天，我們一群研究生聚在一起， 我們說， 女性主義理論的文章和思想正如爆炸般蔓延， 卻還沒有人開設相關課程。"}, {"zh-tw": " So we did what graduate studentstypically do in a situation like that. We said, OK, let's have a study group.", "en": " 所以我們做了研究生一般在此情況下會做的事， 我們說，好，我們來成立一個讀書會，"}, {"zh-tw": " We'll read a text, we'll talk about it, we'll have a potluck dinner. So every week,11 women and me got together.", "en": " 一起讀點文章、然後討論， 當然還有一些晚餐聚會。 所以每星期，我都和11位女性聚在一起。"}, {"zh-tw": " We would read some text in feminist theoryand have a conversation about it.

One of the women was white,and one was black.", "en": " 那是兩個女性間的談話。 其中一位是白人，另一位則是黑人。"}, {"zh-tw": " And the white woman said -- this is going to soundvery anachronistic now -- the white woman said, \"All womenface the same oppression as women. All women are similarlysituated in patriarchy, and therefore all women have a kindof intuitive solidarity or sisterhood.\" And the black woman said,\"I'm not so sure.", "en": " 白人女性說 － 現在聽起來會覺得非常不合時宜 － 白人女性說：「所有女人都因女人的身分受到同樣的壓迫。 所有女人在父權社會下都有類似處境， 因此所有女人都出於直覺地有種團結或姐妹意識。」 那位黑人女性說：「這我可不確定。"}, {"zh-tw": " Let me ask you a question.\" So the black womansays to the white woman, \"When you wake up in the morningand you look in the mirror, what do you see?\" And the white woman said, \"I see a woman.\" And the black woman said,\"You see, that's the problem for me.

Disembodied Western rationality.", "en": " 那會出現在考題嗎？『結構性』怎麼拼？」 所以我希望你們都可以看到， 客觀大概就長這樣。 我代表了無形的西方理性。"}, {"zh-tw": " And that, by the way, is why I thinkmen so often wear ties. Because if you are going to embodydisembodied Western rationality, you need a signifier, and what could be a better signifierof disembodied Western rationality than a garment that at one end is a nooseand the other end points to the genitals? That is mind-body dualism right there.", "en": " 順便提一下，我想那是男人經常打領帶的原因。 因為如果你要體現無形的西方理性， 你需要一個信物， 而對無形的西方理性而言，還有什麼比這個更好的信物 － 把一端打結成絞索，另一端則指著生殖器的東西? 這就是身心二元論。"}, {"zh-tw": " So making gender visible to men is the first step to engaging mento support gender equality. Now, when men first hearabout gender equality, when they first start thinking about it, they often think, many men think, well, that's right,that's fair, that's just, that's the ethical imperative.", "en": " 讓男人看到性別 是讓他們支持男女平等的第一步。 當男人第一次聽到性別平等， 當他們開始思考這個議題， 他們通常認為 － 許多男人認為， 對啊，那樣才對，那是公平、公正， 那是道德義務。"}, {"zh-tw": " But not all men. Some men think --the lightning bolt goes off, and they go, \"Oh my God,yes, gender equality,\" and they will immediately beginto mansplain to you your oppression.", "en": " 但並非所有男人。 有些男人認為 － 閃電熄滅了， 他們會想：「我的天，對，性別平等」 然後立刻開始搬出男性至上的觀點對你們進行壓迫。"}, {"zh-tw": " They see supporting gender equalitysomething akin to the cavalry, like, \"Thanks very much for bringing thisto our attention, ladies, we'll take it from here.\" This results in a syndrome that I liketo call 'premature self-congratulation.' There's another group, though,that actively resists gender equality, that sees gender equalityas something that is detrimental to men. I was on a TV talk showopposite four white men.", "en": " 他們認為支持性別平等等同苦難， 他們會想，「女士們，感謝你們提出這個引起我們的注意， 我們會看著辦。」 形成一種我喜歡稱為「過早沾沾自喜」的症狀。 當然還有一群人，積極打壓性別平等， 他們將性別平等視為一種對男人有害的東西。 我曾在一個電視談話節目面對四個白人男性。"}, {"zh-tw": " This is the beginning of the bookI wrote, 'Angry White Men.' These were four angry white men who believed that they,white men in America, were the victims of reverse discriminationin the workplace. And they all told storiesabout how they were qualified for jobs, qualified for promotions, they didn't get them,they were really angry.", "en": " 這是日後我寫下《憤怒的白人男性》這本書的起源。 四個憤怒的白人男性， 相信他們這些美國白人男性， 是工作場合裡逆向性別歧視的受害者。 他們訴說自己如何勝任一些工作、 擁有升遷的資格， 卻沒有得到機會，他們非常生氣。"}, {"zh-tw": " And the reason I'm telling you thisis I want you to hear the title of this particular show. It was a quote from one of the men, and the quote was, \"A Black Woman Stole My Job.\" And they all told their stories, qualified for jobs,qualified for promotions, didn't get it, really angry.", "en": " 我之所以告訴各位這件事，是想讓大家聽聽這個節目的名稱。 那是引述自其中一位的話， 而這句話是： 「一個女黑人偷了我的工作。」 他們每個都訴說自己的故事， 如何勝任工作、如何有資格升遷 卻得不到，非常生氣。"}, {"zh-tw": " And then it was my turn to speak, and I said, \"I havejust one question for you guys, and it's about the title of the show, 'A Black Woman Stole My Job.' Actually, it's aboutone word in the title. I want to know about the word 'my.' Where did you get the ideait was your job? Why isn't the title of the show,'A Black Woman Got the Job?' or 'A Black Woman Got A Job?'\" Because without confrontingmen's sense of entitlement, I don't think we'll ever understandwhy so many men resist gender equality.", "en": " 然後輪到我說話， 我說：「我對你們只有一個問題， 就是這個節目的名稱， 『一個女黑人偷了我的工作』 實際上，我的問題在其中一個詞。 我想知道的是『我的』這個詞， 你為什麼會認為這是你的工作? 為什麼節目名稱不是『一位黑人女性得到那份工作』? 或是『一位黑人女性得到一份工作』？ 因為如果不是和男人的權力感有所衝突， 我不認為我們真能了解為何這麼多人打壓性別平等。"}, {"zh-tw": " Look, we think thisis a level playing field, so any policy that tilts iteven a little bit, we think, \"Oh my God,water's rushing uphill. It's reverse discrimination against us.\" So let me be very clear: white men in Europe and the United States are the beneficiaries of the singlegreatest affirmative action program in the history of the world.", "en": " 請注意，我們認為這樣才是公平的競爭環境， 所以任何政策只要讓它偏移一點， 我們就想：「我的天，水往上流了。 這是對我們的逆向歧視。」 所以我要非常明白地說： 在歐洲和美國的白人男性， 是全世界的歷史上最大的平權活動中的受益者。"}, {"zh-tw": " It is called \"the history of the world.\" So, now I've establishedsome of the obstacles to engaging men, but why should we support gender equality? Of course, it's fair,it's right and it's just. But more than that, gender equality is alsoin our interest as men.", "en": " 這說的是「全世界的歷史」。 所以，現在我已經製造了一些吸引男性的阻礙， 但為什麼我們應該支持性別平等? 當然，那才公平，那是正確的、正義的事。 但不僅如此， 性別平等也對男人有利。"}, {"zh-tw": " If you listen to what men sayabout what they want in their lives, gender equality is actually a wayfor us to get the lives we want to live. Gender equality is good for countries.", "en": " 如果你聽聽男人談論自己在生命中想要的東西， 性別平等其實是給予我們理想生活的一種方式。 性別平等對國家有利。"}, {"zh-tw": " It turns out, according to most studies, that those countriesthat are the most gender equal are also the countries that score higheston the happiness scale. And that's not just becausethey're all in Europe.", "en": " 根據大多數研究的結果， 性別最平等的國家 同時也是快樂指數最高的國家。 而且不是因為他們都在歐洲。"}, {"zh-tw": " Even within Europe, those countriesthat are more gender equal also have the highest levels of happiness. It is also good for companies.", "en": " 即使在歐洲的國家中，性別比較平等的國家 也是快樂指數最高的。 對公司也有好處。"}, {"zh-tw": " Research by Catalyst and othershas shown conclusively that the more gender-equal companies are, the better it is for workers, the happier their labor force is. They have lower job turnover.They have lower levels of attrition.", "en": " 由Catalyst和其他機構所做的研結果確切顯示 公司越是性別平等， 對員工的結果越好， 因為他們的員工會越快樂。 他們的流動率較低、工作摩擦較少。"}, {"zh-tw": " They have an easier time recruiting. They have higher rates of retention,higher job satisfaction, higher rates of productivity.", "en": " 他們也比較容易招募到員工。 他們擁有較高的員工留職率、工作滿意度、 生產力也較高。"}, {"zh-tw": " So the question I'm often askedin companies is, \"Boy, this gender equality thing,that's really going to be expensive, huh?\" And I say, \"Oh no, in fact,what you have to start calculating is how much gender inequalityis already costing you. It is extremely expensive.\" So it is good for business.", "en": " 所以企業經理人常常問我的問題是： 「性別平等啊，那要花很多錢，是吧?」 然後我說：「喔不，事實上，你得開始算算 不這麼做已經花了你們多少錢， 那才是最貴的花費。」 所以性別平等對企業是有利的。"}, {"zh-tw": " And the other thing is, it's good for men. It is good for the kind of liveswe want to live, because young men especiallyhave changed enormously, and they want to have livesthat are animated by terrific relationshipswith their children.", "en": " 另一個好處是，它也對男人有利。 它有利於我們想要過的生活， 因為現在的年輕男人和過去有很大的不同， 他們渴望和孩子擁有很棒的親子關係， 來達成美好而動人的生活。"}, {"zh-tw": " They expect their partners,their spouses, their wives, to work outside the home and be just as committedto their careers as they are. I was talking, to give youan illustration of this change -- Some of you may remember this.", "en": " 他們期待他們的伴侶、配偶、妻子 外出工作， 和他們一樣專注於事業。 現在給各位一個能說明這個轉變的案例 － 你們有些人可能記得這個。"}, {"zh-tw": " When I was a lot younger,there was a riddle that was posed to us. Some of you may winceto remember this riddle.", "en": " 在我年輕許多時，曾被問過一個謎題， 有些人可能會皺起眉頭、不太記得，"}, {"zh-tw": " This riddle went something like this. A man and his sonare driving on the freeway, and they're in a terrible accident, and the father is killed, and the son is broughtto the hospital emergency room, and as they're bringing the soninto the hospital emergency room, the emergency room attending physiciansees the boy and says, \"Oh, I can't treat him, that's my son.\" How is this possible? We were flummoxed by this.", "en": " 但這個謎題是這樣的。 一個男人和他兒子行駛於高速公路上， 他們出了一場嚴重車禍， 父親當場死亡， 兒子被送到一家醫院的急診室， 而當他們將兒子推進急診室時， 急診室的值班醫師看了這個男孩後說， 「哦，我不能治療他，他是我兒子。」 這怎麼可能呢? 這個謎題讓我們非常困惑，"}, {"zh-tw": " We could not figure this out. Well, I decided to do a little experimentwith my 16-year old son.", "en": " 我們無法找出答案。 所以，我決定對16歲的兒子進行一個小實驗，"}, {"zh-tw": " He had a bunch of his friendshanging out at the house watching a game on TV recently.

No problem. Just like that. Except for my son, who said,\"Well, he could have two dads.\" That's an index, an indicatorof how things have changed.", "en": " 結果，這些16歲的男孩們， 立即對我說：「那是他媽媽，對吧?」 毫無猶豫、就那樣回答。 除了我兒子，他說：「喔，他也可能有兩個爸爸。」 這是一個指標，說明事情的轉變。"}, {"zh-tw": " Younger men today expectto be able to balance work and family.
