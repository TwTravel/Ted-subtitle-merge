We get the geneticists keeping on telling us how extremely closely we are related -- hardly any genes of difference, very, very closely related. And yet, when you look at the phenotypes, there's a chimp, there's a man; they're astoundingly different, no resemblance at all.", "en": " 那問題就是：為何我們跟黑猩猩如此不同？ 基因學家不斷告訴我們 人類和黑猩猩有多麼相像，基因幾乎一模一樣 是非常非常相近的物種 可是當你觀察外顯型時 一邊是黑猩猩 一邊是人類 兩者的差異令人震驚 完全沒有相似之處"}, {"zh-tw": " I'm not talking about airy-fairy stuff about culture or psychology, or behavior.

She'll say anything won't she?\" But by now, everybody agrees that the elephant had an aquatic ancestor.", "en": " 看看大象 難道你忘了大象嗎？ 1982年的時候我回答： 也許大象的祖先也是水生動物啊 這回答引來一陣陣的笑聲！ 「那瘋女人！她又錯亂了！老是胡言亂語…」 但是現在，每個人都認同大象有個水生動物的祖先"}, {"zh-tw": " This has come 'round to be that all those naked pachyderms have aquatic ancestors.

As an absolute connection, it only works one way.", "en": " 去年在佛羅里達發現了犀牛已絕種的祖先 那些人說：看來似乎大部分的時間都生活在水裡 所以這就是赤裸皮膚與水之間的密切關聯 這種絕對關係是單向的"}, {"zh-tw": " You can't say all aquatic animals are naked, because look at the sea otter. But you can say that every animal that has become naked has been conditioned by water, in its own lifetime, or the lifetime of its ancestors. I think this is significant.", "en": " 你不能說所有水生動物都是赤裸的 看看海獺就會明白 不過你可以說 所有赤裸的動物 牠或牠祖先的生命都跟水有關係 我認為這具有重大意義"}, {"zh-tw": " The only exception is the naked Somalian mole-rat, which never puts its nose above the surface of the ground.

David Attenborough thinks it's significant, as the possible beginning of our bipedalism.", "en": " 只有一種情況 會讓牠們全部一直用兩腳走路 就是費力走過水的時候 你覺得這有意義嗎？ 大衛艾登堡認為很有意義 因為這有可能就是兩足類的原始"}, {"zh-tw": " Look at the fat layer.

Well they do know, that if you look at other aquatic mammals, the fat that in most land mammals is deposited inside the body wall, around the kidneys and the intestines and so on, has started to migrate to the outside, and spread out in a layer inside the skin. In the whale it's complete: no fat inside at all, all in blubber outside.", "en": " 為什麼我們會有皮下脂肪呢 專家知道如果你觀察其他水生哺乳類動物 一般陸上動物的脂肪 都囤積在體內的體壁上 在腎臟和大小腸周圍等等 水生哺乳類的脂肪則轉移到體壁外 分散成皮膚內的脂肪層 鯨魚是進化完整的 體內毫無脂肪 全是體外的鯨脂"}, {"zh-tw": " We cannot avoid the suspicion that in our case it's started to happen.

We can speak.", "en": " 關於我們為何會說話的問題 我們會說話"}, {"zh-tw": " And the gorilla can't speak. Why?
