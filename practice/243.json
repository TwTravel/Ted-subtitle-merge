Optimism is sometimes characterized as a belief, an intellectual posture. As Mahatma Gandhi famously said, \"You must become the change you wish to see in the world.\" And the outcome about which we wish to be optimistic is not going to be created by the belief alone, except to the extent that the belief brings about new behavior. But the word \"behavior\" is also, I think, sometimes misunderstood in this context.", "en": " 我們怎敢說自己是樂觀派呢？ 樂觀，有時被當成一種信仰，一種理智的態度 誠如印度國父甘地所言， 「你希望世界變成什麼樣子，你自己要先成為那個樣子」 我們想要樂觀，可是樂觀 並不會因為我們想要而自動產生 除非我們的想法，某個程度上 可以帶來新的行為，但是「行為」這個字眼 我覺得，有時候在這種情況下會被誤解"}, {"zh-tw": " I'm a big advocate of changing the lightbulbs and buying hybrids, and Tipper and I put 33 solar panels on our house, and dug the geothermal wells, and did all of that other stuff.

And so I said, \"How do you do?\" And she said, \"You know, if you dyed your hair black, you would look just like Al Gore.\" Many years ago, when I was a young congressman, I spent an awful lot of time dealing with the challenge of nuclear arms control -- the nuclear arms race.
