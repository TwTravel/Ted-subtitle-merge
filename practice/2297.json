Abortion is common.", "en": " 但是波莉給了我一項非常特別的禮物： 我知道我不是獨自受苦， 我也領悟到原來墮胎是可以拿出來談的。 墮胎很普遍。"}, {"zh-tw": " According to the Guttmacher Institute,one in three women in America will have an abortion in their lifetime.

One way is to listen closely.", "en": " 有兩個重要的方法可以著手。 一個是仔細聆聽，"}, {"zh-tw": " And the other way is to share stories. So, 15 years ago, I cofoundedan organization called Exhale to start listening to people who have had abortions.", "en": " 另一個就是分享故事。 15 年前，我與人共創一家名叫「舒氣」的組織， 開始傾聽人們墮胎的心聲。"}, {"zh-tw": " The first thing we did was create a talk-line, where women and men could call to get emotional support. Free of judgment and politics,believe it or not, nothing like our sevice had ever existed.", "en": " 首先我們成立一條輔導專線， 不分男女都能打電話進來，在情緒上得到支持。 這裡沒有論斷，也不談政治。信不信，像我們這樣的服務 從不曾出現過。"}, {"zh-tw": " We needed a new framework that could hold all the experiences that we were hearing on our talk-line.

It also works on deeply personal topics that might only matter to you and your immediate family and friends.", "en": " 所以我們創立了「優聲權」。 除了墮胎，優聲權還處理 全球歷時多年的棘手問題， 像是移民、宗教寬容、對婦女施暴等問題。 它也處理切身的個人問題，只有你自己、 你的直系親屬及摯友才會關心。"}, {"zh-tw": " They have a terminal illness, their mother just died, they have a child with special needsand they can't talk about it. Listening and storytelling arethe hallmarks of pro-voice practice.", "en": " 有人得了絕症，有人的母親剛去世， 有人的孩子需要特殊教育卻無法拿出來談。 聽故事與講故事是優聲權的兩大特點。"}, {"zh-tw": " Listening and storytelling. That sounds pretty nice.", "en": " 聽故事與講故事， 聽起來很美好。"}, {"zh-tw": " Sounds maybe, easy?We could all do that. It's not easy.It's very hard.", "en": " 聽起來好像很容易？我們都會做。 這並不容易，而且非常難。"}, {"zh-tw": " Pro-voice is hard because we are talkingabout things everyone's fighting about or the things that no one wants to talk about. I wish I could tell you that when you decide to be pro-voice, that you'll find beautiful moments of breakthrough and gardens full of flowers, where listening and storytellingcreates wonderful \"a-ha\" moments.", "en": " 優聲權很難，因為我們在談的，是每個人都在爭論 或沒有人想提出來談的事。 我真希望我能告訴你，當你決定要「優聲」， 你會發現突破的美麗瞬間，園子開滿了鮮花， 在那裡，講故事與說故事能產生美妙的頓悟時刻。"}, {"zh-tw": " I wish I could tell you that there wouldbe a feminist welcoming party for you, or that there's a long-lost sisterhoodof people who are just ready to have your back when you get slammed.

There is no perfect timeand there is no perfect place to start a difficult conversation.", "en": " 如果我們真的傾聽彼此， 我們會聽到需要我們設身處地的故事。 永遠沒有完美的時刻與完美的地點 來展開艱難的對話。"}, {"zh-tw": " There's never a time when everyone will beon the same page, share the same lens, or know the same history. So, let's talk about listeningand how to be a good listener.", "en": " 永遠不會有什麼時刻，大家想法一致、看法一致， 或經歷相同的過去。 所以，就來談談傾聽的技巧，怎樣變成好的聆聽者。"}, {"zh-tw": " There's lots of ways to be a good listenerand I'm going to give you just a couple. One is to ask open-ended questions.", "en": " 有很多方法能成為好的聆聽者，我在這裡跟大家說幾個。 其中一個就是要問開放式問題。"}, {"zh-tw": " You can ask yourself or someone that you know, \"How are you feeling?\" \"What was that like?\" \"What do you hope for, now?\" Another way to be a good listener is to use reflective language. If someone is talking abouttheir own personal experience, use the words that they use.", "en": " 你能問自己或你認識的人： 「你覺得如何？」 「那像什麼？」 「你現在希望怎麼辦？」 另一個成為好的聆聽者的方法是用反映語法。 如果有人在談他們的個人經驗， 你要用他們用的字。"}, {"zh-tw": " If someone is talking about an abortionand they say the word \"baby,\" you can say \"baby.\" If they say \"fetus,\"you can say \"fetus.\" If someone describes themselvesas gender queer to you, you can say \"gender queer.\" If someone kind of looks like a he,but they say they're a she -- it's cool. Call that person a she.", "en": " 如果有人在談墮胎時用了「寶貝」這個字， 你也可以用「寶貝」。 如果他們說「胎兒」，你也可以說「胎兒」。 如果他們對你描述自己是性別酷兒， 你也可以說性別酷兒。 如果某人看起來像是男的，可是他說他自己是女的， 那也沒關係，就稱他是女性。"}, {"zh-tw": " When we reflect the language of the personwho is sharing their own story, we are conveying that we are interestedin understanding who they are and what they're going through. The same way that we hope people are interested in knowing us.", "en": " 當我們反映分享者的語言時， 我們就傳達出我們想瞭解他們是誰， 及他們經歷的一切。 就跟我們希望別人也會想瞭解我們一樣。"}, {"zh-tw": " So, I'll never forget being in one of the Exhale counselor meetings, listening to a volunteer talk about howshe was getting a lot of calls from Christian women who were talking about God. Now, some of our volunteers are religious,but this particular one was not.", "en": " 所以，我永遠都忘不了在某次舒氣輔導員會議上， 聽一位志工說她如何面對 許多女基督徒在電話上談到神的故事。 我們有些志工是信教的，但這位不是。"}, {"zh-tw": " At first, it felt a little weird for her to talk to callers about God. So, she decided to get comfortable.", "en": " 一開始，她覺得跟來電者談神有點怪。 所以她決定要讓自己自在一點。"}, {"zh-tw": " And she stood in front of her mirror at home, and she said the word \"God.\" \"God.\" \"God.\" \"God.\" \"God.\" \"God.\" \"God.\" Over and over and over againuntil the word no longer felt strange coming out her mouth. Saying the word God did not turn this volunteer into a Christian, but it did make her a much better listener of Christian women.", "en": " 她在家裡站在鏡子前說「神」。 「神」。 「神」。 「神」。 「神」。 「神」。 「神」。 一次又一次的說，直到從她口中說出這個字 不再感到奇怪。 說神這個字沒有讓這位志工成為基督徒， 但這的確讓她在面對基督徒婦女時成為更好的聆聽者。"}, {"zh-tw": " So, another way to be pro-voiceis to share stories, and one risk that you take on, when youshare your story with someone else, is that given the sameset of circumstances as you they might actuallymake a different decision. For example, if you're telling a story about your abortion, realize that she might have had the baby.", "en": " 那麼，另一個成為「優聲」的方法是分享故事。 你跟別人分享自己的故事時，你要承擔的風險是， 就算聽者跟你的處境相同， 他們也可能做出不同的決定。 舉例來說，你說了自己墮胎的故事， 卻發現她可能留下孩子。"}, {"zh-tw": " She might have placed for adoption. She might have told her parents and her partner -- or not.", "en": " 她也可能送人領養。 她可能告訴她的父母或同居人，也可能沒說。"}, {"zh-tw": " She might have felt relief and confidence,even though you felt sad and lost. This is okay.", "en": " 她可能覺得鬆了口氣、很有把握，而你卻覺得悲慘失落。 這沒關係。"}, {"zh-tw": " Empathy gets created the moment weimagine ourselves in someone else's shoes. It doesn't mean we all have to end up in the same place.", "en": " 同理心在我們設身處地的瞬間就產生了。 這不代表我們會有一樣的結局。"}, {"zh-tw": " It's not agreement, it's not samenessthat pro-voice is after. It creates a culture and a society that values what make us special and unique.", "en": " 優聲權追求的並非同意、並非一致。 它創造一種文化、一個社會，珍視讓我們獨特的差異。"}, {"zh-tw": " It values what makes us human,our flaws and our imperfections. And this way of thinking allows us to seeour differences with respect, instead of fear.", "en": " 它珍視我們之所以為人的一切，我們的缺陷和我們的不完美。 這種思維讓我們尊重彼此的不同， 而不是恐懼。"}, {"zh-tw": " And it generates the empathy that we need to overcome all the waysthat we try to hurt one another. Stigma, shame, prejudice, discrimination, oppression.", "en": " 而如此就產生我們所需的同理心， 以克服試圖傷害彼此的一切。 汙名、恥辱、偏見、歧視、壓迫。"}, {"zh-tw": " Pro-voice is contagious,and the more it's practiced the more it spreads. So, last year I was pregnant again.", "en": " 優聲權具感染力， 練習愈多，傳染愈快。 去年我又懷孕了。"}, {"zh-tw": " This time I was looking forward to the birth of my son. And while pregnant, I had never been askedhow I was feeling so much in all my life.", "en": " 這次我很期待我兒子出生。 懷孕時，我接受到的關心真是一生中最多的階段。"}, {"zh-tw": " And however I replied, whether I wasfeeling wonderful and excited or scared and totally freaked out, there was always someone theregiving me a \"been there\" response. It was awesome.", "en": " 無論我如何回答，是覺得好奇妙、好興奮， 還是很害怕、完全嚇壞了， 總有人對我說：「我也是過來人。」 真棒。"}, {"zh-tw": " It was a welcome, yet dramaticdeparture from what I experience when I talk aboutmy mixed feelings of my abortion. Pro-voice is about the real storiesof real people making an impact on the way abortion and so many other politicizedand stigmatized issues are understood and discussed.", "en": " 這是個令人愉快、戲劇性的再出發， 揮別我五味雜陳的墮胎經驗。 優聲權要的是用真人真事， 衝擊大家對墮胎 及其他被政治化、汙名化的議題 所持的看法及爭論。"}, {"zh-tw": " From sexuality and mental healthto poverty and incarceration. Far beyond definitionas single right or wrong decisions, our experiences can exist on a spectrum.", "en": " 從性取向、心理健康、貧窮到監禁都是。 我們的經歷形形色色，遠遠超過二分法的定義。"}, {"zh-tw": " Pro-voice focuses that conversationon human experience and it makes support and respectpossible for all. Thank you.", "en": " 優聲權的重點是人類經歷的對話， 並支持及尊重所有可能。 謝謝。"}], "title": "Aspen Baker A Better Way To Talk About Abortion"}
