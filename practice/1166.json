And in the other case,the sperm is carrying an X chromosome, meeting the X chromosome of the egg.", "en": " 那麼在這種情況下, 我來設想一下，一種情況是 攜帶者Y染色體的精子 遇到攜帶者X染色體的卵子 另一種情況 攜帶者X染色體的精子, 遇到攜帶者X染色體的卵子。"}, {"zh-tw": " Both are viable; both take off. We'll come back to these people later.", "en": " 兩種情況都可能 我們之後再來看這兩對夫婦。"}, {"zh-tw": " So I wear two hats in most of what I do. As the one hat, I do history of anatomy.", "en": " 在我所從事的領域 我擔任兩個角色。 一個角色是, 我做解剖身體結構學歷史研究。"}, {"zh-tw": " I'm a historian by training,and what I study in that case is the way that peoplehave dealt with anatomy -- meaning human bodies, animal bodies -- how they dealt with bodily fluids,concepts of bodies; how have they thought about bodies. The other hat that I've wornin my work is as an activist, as a patient advocate -- or, as I sometimes say,as an impatient advocate -- for people who are patients of doctors.", "en": " 我是個史學工作者, 我所研究的是 人類對於身體結構的處理方法-- 即人類軀體，動物軀體-- 他們如何處理非常態的軀體，概念上的軀體; 他們是如何認識軀體。 另一個角色是 一名活動家 作為一個為病人辯護人的角色-- 或者說，像我有時候說的，是一個很急切的宣導者的角色-- 為了那些醫生的病人們。"}, {"zh-tw": " In that case, what I've worked withis people who have body types that challenge social norms. So some of whatI've worked on, for example, is people who are conjoined twins -- two people within one body.", "en": " 那樣的話，在我工作中 所接觸到的是一些 挑戰著社會規範的人。 因此，我接觸到的，例如 像連體嬰兒這樣的人, 兩個人共用一個身體。"}, {"zh-tw": " Some of what I've worked onis people who have dwarfism -- so people who are muchshorter than typical.

Intersex comesin a lot of different forms.", "en": " 總的來說，這個症狀可以被叫做雙性人。 雙性可以有多種的形式。"}, {"zh-tw": " I'll just give you a few examplesof the types of ways you can have sex that isn't standard for male or female. So in one instance, you can have somebodywho has an XY chromosomal basis, and that SRY gene on the Y chromosome tells the proto-gonads,which we all have in the fetal life, to become testes.", "en": " 我來舉幾個例子 來說明你可以具有 既不是標準的男性特徵也不是標準的女性特徵的類型。 例子之一, 一個人可以擁有XY染色體, 並且，在Y染色體上的SRY基因(雄性性別決定基因) 刺激我們在胎兒時期都有的原始性腺 變成睾丸。"}, {"zh-tw": " So in the fetal life,those testes are pumping out testosterone. But because this individuallacks receptors to hear that testosterone, the body doesn't reactto the testosterone.", "en": " 因此在胎兒時期，睾丸放出睾丸激素。 但是這個個體缺少受體 來接收睾丸激素, 身體不能對睾丸激素做出反應。"}, {"zh-tw": " And this is a syndrome calledandrogen insensitivity syndrome.

They're in the back of our body.", "en": " 女孩, 像男孩同樣, 在我們身體內有一個器官叫做腎上腺。 它在我們身體的後部。"}, {"zh-tw": " And the adrenal glands make androgens,which are a masculinizing hormone.

The consequence is that somebody like me has actually had a brainexposed to more androgens than the woman born with testeswho has androgen insensitivity syndrome.", "en": " 我們分泌雄性激素，並且對它有反應。 結果是，那些像我一樣的人, 大腦暴露在更多的雄性激素下 而不是出生時就有睾丸 即雄性激素不敏感綜合征。"}, {"zh-tw": " So sex is really complicated -- it's not just that intersex people are in the middleof all the sex spectrum -- in some ways,they can be all over the place. Another example: a few years ago I got a callfrom a man who was 19 years old, who was born a boy, raised a boy, had a girlfriend,had sex with his girlfriend, had a life as a guy, and had just found outthat he had ovaries and a uterus inside.", "en": " 所以說性別是個非常複雜的東西；不僅僅是那些雙性的人 即處在兩性之間的人 -- 在某些方面，這種人到處都是。 還有一個例子: 幾年前，我接到一個19﻿歲男子打來的電話, 他生下來是個男孩，也被當作男孩來養, 後來有了女朋友，也和女友發生了性關係, 一直過著男孩的生活, 但最近，他發現自己體內有卵巢和子宮。"}, {"zh-tw": " What he had was an extreme form of a condition calledcongenital adrenal hyperplasia.

And he was born looking like a boy --nobody suspected anything.", "en": " 結果就是，他發育了男性生殖器官, 他的大腦接受了 更多的典型的男性荷爾蒙的成分。 因此他生下來看起來像個男孩兒--根本沒人懷疑。"}, {"zh-tw": " And it was only when he hadreached the age of 19 that he began to have enough medicalproblems from menstruating internally, that doctors figured out that, in fact,he was female, internally. OK, so just one more quick exampleof a way you can have intersex.", "en": " 只有當他長到19歲的時候 當他開始遇到生理問題的時候 也就是說從體內出現月經起, 醫生指出，實際上他的內部是女性。 好，我們再來快看一個例子, 可能具有兩性特徵的例子。"}, {"zh-tw": " Some people who have XX chromosomesdevelop what are called ovotestis, which is when you have ovarian tissuewith testicular tissue wrapped around it. And we're not exactly surewhy that happens.", "en": " 一些有XX染色體的人 會發育一種叫做卵睾的器官, 也就是當卵巢組織 被睾丸組織包裹起來的一種器官。 我們還不能確定它的成因。"}, {"zh-tw": " So sex can comein lots of different varieties. The reason that childrenwith these kinds of bodies -- whether it's dwarfism,or it's conjoined twinning, or it's an intersex type -- are often \"normalized\" by surgeons is not because it actually leaves thembetter off in terms of physical health.", "en": " 所以說性別可以是很多種形式。 孩子們 擁有這些身體特徵的-- 不論是侏儒症，或者連體嬰兒 或者是雙性型的-- 經常被外科醫生要求變得和正常人一樣的原因 實際上不是因為那樣 對身體健康比較好。"}, {"zh-tw": " In many cases, people are actuallyperfectly healthy. The reason they're often subjectto various kinds of surgeries is because they threatenour social categories.", "en": " 因為很多情況下，他們的身體其實都很健康。 他們接受各種外科手術的原因 是因為他們恐懼我們社會上對人的分類。"}, {"zh-tw": " Our system has been basedtypically on the idea that a particular kind of anatomycomes with a particular identity. So we have the conceptthat what it means to be a woman is to have a female identity; what it means to be a black personis, allegedly, to have an African anatomy in terms of your history.", "en": " 或者說社會體系已經有一個典型的認識 也就是一個有特殊身體結構的人，伴隨著特殊的身份。 因此，我們的概念就是最為一個女人 就必須有女性的特性; 以此類推，一個黑人 就得具有在你的履歷中 非洲人的身體結構特徵。"}, {"zh-tw": " And so we havethis terribly simplistic idea. And when we're faced with a body that actually presents ussomething quite different, it startles us in termsof those categorizations.", "en": " 因此我們就有了這種過於簡單而糟糕的認識。 當我們面對一個 某些方面是完全與眾不同的身體的時候, 那些把他們歸為另類的想法讓我們感到吃驚。"}, {"zh-tw": " So we have a lot of very romantic ideasin our culture about individualism. And our nation's really founded ona very romantic concept of individualism.", "en": " 應此我們的文化中有很多關於個人主義 不切實際的想法。 並且我們國家建立在一個非常不實際的個人主義的概念上。"}, {"zh-tw": " You can imagine how startling then it is when you have children who are bornwho are two people inside of one body. Where I ran into the most heatfrom this most recently was last year when South African runner,Caster Semenya, had her sex called into questionat the International Games in Berlin.", "en": " 好，你可以想像這會是多麼令人震驚, 倘若你有兩個孩子 出生的時候是兩個身體生在一個身體中。 我最近一次遇到這種情況是 去年的時候，非洲田徑運動員，卡斯特爾·塞門亞, 在柏林國際比賽中被質疑性別問題。"}, {"zh-tw": " I had a lot of journalistscalling me, asking me, \"Which is the test they're going to run that will tell us whether or notCaster Semenya is male or female?\" And I had to explain to the journaliststhere isn't such a test. In fact, we now knowthat sex is complicated enough that we have to admit: Nature doesn't draw the linefor us between male and female, or between male and intersexand female and intersex; we actually draw that line on nature.", "en": " 許多記者給我打電話，問我: 「他們會用哪種檢測方法 來向大家證明 卡斯特爾·塞門亞是男還是女？」 於是我不得不跟他們解釋說，根本沒有檢測的方法。 事實上，我們現在已經瞭解 性別是非常複雜的, 我們不得不承認 大自然根本就沒有一個明確的分界線來區分男性或女性, 或者男性和雙性以及女性和雙性; 這條分界線實際上是我們自己畫的。"}, {"zh-tw": " So what we have is a sort of situationwhere the farther our science goes, the more we have to admit to ourselvesthat these categories that we thought of as stableanatomical categories, that mapped very simplyto stable identity categories are a lot more fuzzy than we thought. And it's not just in terms of sex.", "en": " 因此我們現在的情況是 科學越發展 我們越要對我們本身承認 這些性別的分類形式, 也就是我們認為很理所當然的身體結構學上的分類 即過於簡單把人 分成了不同的性別群體分類 實際情況要比我們想像的模糊的多。 並且這不僅僅是關於性別的問題。"}, {"zh-tw": " It's also in terms of race, which turns out to bevastly more complicated than our terminology has allowed. As we look, we get into all sortsof uncomfortable areas.", "en": " 也同樣是關於種族的問題, 這個複雜程度 遠不是我們的學術語言所能形容的。 如我們所見，我們涉及各種各樣艱難的領域。"}, {"zh-tw": " We look, for example, about the fact that we share at least 95 percentof our DNA with chimpanzees. What are we to make of the fact that we differ from themonly, really, by a few nucleotides? And as we get fartherand farther with our science, we get more and moreinto a discomforted zone, where we have to acknowledgethat the simplistic categories we've had are probably overly simplistic.", "en": " 我們來看一個例子，現實情況是 我們用95%的人類的DNA 與大猩猩進行對比。 我們該如何領受事實上 人類和大猩猩的DNA只是在一些核苷酸上有所不同? 科技越是發展, 我們越會涉及到讓人苦惱的領域, 那些我們現在必須認識到的 曾經過於簡單化 的生物分類領域。"}, {"zh-tw": " So we're seeing thisin all sorts of places in human life. One of the placeswe're seeing it, for example, in our culture,in the United States today, is battles over the beginningof life and the end of life.", "en": " 正因如此，我們正在審視著 人類生活中的各個領域 我們看到其中一個領域，舉個例子, 當今美國的文化領域, 激烈爭辯著生命的起源和終結。"}, {"zh-tw": " We have difficult conversations about at what point we decidea body becomes a human, such that it has a differentright than a fetal life. We have very difficultconversations nowadays -- probably not out in the openas much as within medicine -- about the questionof when somebody's dead.", "en": " 我們有一個艱難的討論 關於我們從什麼時候一個軀體成為了一個人, 從而有了不同於胎兒的權利。 我們當今有一個非常困難的爭論-- 也許在外部不如在醫學界內爭論的激烈-- 是關於何時認定為人死亡的疑問。"}, {"zh-tw": " In the past, our ancestorsnever had to struggle so much with this questionof when somebody was dead. At most, they'd sticka feather on somebody's nose, and if it twitched,they didn't bury them yet.", "en": " 過去，人死的時候, 我們的祖先從來不會過多的糾結於此。 最多也就是把一個羽毛粘在人的鼻子下, 如果羽毛動了，旁人就不會把他們埋掉。 如果羽毛不動，就會埋了他們。"}, {"zh-tw": " If it stopped twitching, you bury them. But today, we have a situation where we want to takevital organs out of beings and give them to other beings.", "en": " 但是如今的情況都是 我們希望把死者的器官 移植到其他人的身體上。"}, {"zh-tw": " And as a consequence, we have to strugglewith this really difficult question about who's dead, and this leads usto a really difficult situation where we don't have such simplecategories as we've had before. Now you might think that all thisbreaking-down of categories would make somebody like me really happy.", "en": " 結果就是 我們開始糾結在上面所提到的難題中 關於到底是誰死了沒有。 這導致我們進入一個很困難的情況, 這個情況不適用之前過於簡單的分類。 現在你也許會想，所有的這些正在崩潰的分類 也許會讓像我這樣的人感到高興。"}, {"zh-tw": " I'm a political progressive,I defend people with unusual bodies, but I have to admit to youthat it makes me nervous. Understanding that these categories are really much more unstablethan we thought makes me tense.", "en": " 我是一個在政治觀點上不斷進步的人，我維護那些身體異于常人的人, 但是我必須承認，這種改變讓我感到不安。 知道這個群體生活的不穩定程度 要遠遠高過我們的想像令我感到緊張。 我的緊張是來自"}, {"zh-tw": " It makes me tense from the point of viewof thinking about democracy. So in order to tell youabout that tension, I have to first admit to youa huge fan of the Founding Fathers.", "en": " 於民主的觀點。 所以，為了告訴大家這種緊張的程度, 我首先要承認，我是開國元勳的忠實擁躉。"}, {"zh-tw": " I know they were racists,I know they were sexist, but they were great.

The Founding Fathers were,for my point of view, the original anatomical activists, and this is why.", "en": " 建國者們發生的事情。 建國者們，我認為他們是 最早的結構學活動家, 這也是我愛他們的原因。"}, {"zh-tw": " What they rejectedwas an anatomical concept and replaced it with another one that was radical and beautifuland held us for 200 years. So as you all recall, what our Founding Fathers wererejecting was a concept of monarchy, and the monarchy was basically basedon a very simplistic concept of anatomy.", "en": " 他們反對的是一個結構學的概念 並且用另一個取而代之 這個基本美好的概念保持了200年。 大家回憶一下, 我們的建國者們反對的是一個君主制度的概念。 並且這個君主制是基於 過於簡單化的結構學概念上的。"}, {"zh-tw": " The monarchs of the old worlddidn't have a concept of DNA, but they did have a concept of birthright. They had a concept of blue blood.", "en": " 舊體制下的帝王們 沒有DNA的概念, 但是他們遵從的是「出身」的理念。 他們有貴族的概念。"}, {"zh-tw": " They had the idea that the peoplewho would be in political power should be in political powerbecause of the blood being passed down from grandfather to fatherto son and so forth. The Founding Fathers rejected that idea, and they replaced itwith a new anatomical concept, and that conceptwas \"all men are created equal.\" They leveled that playing fieldand decided the anatomy that mattered was the commonality of anatomy,not the difference in anatomy, and that was a really radical thing to do.", "en": " 他們認為，身在政治權力下的人 就應該掌握權力 是因為貴族血統要 從祖父到父親到兒子一代代傳承。 建國者們反對這種觀點, 他們用一種新的結構上的概念取而代之, 那種概念就是 人人平等。 他們消除了等級觀念 並且確定新的結構特點 是公民平等的結構, 而不是出身的貴賤。 在當時那確實是一個很激進的改革。"}, {"zh-tw": " Now they were doing it in part because they were partof an Enlightenment system where two things were growing up together. And that was democracy growing up, but it was also sciencegrowing up at the same time.", "en": " 某種程度上，這種改革現在仍然在進行 因為他們是啟蒙運動系統的一部分, 兩件事情是共同發展的。 民主制度在當時正在形成, 但同時科技也在發展。"}, {"zh-tw": " And it's really clear, if you lookat the history of the Founding Fathers, a lot of them were veryinterested in science, and they were interestedin the concept of a naturalistic world. They were moving awayfrom supernatural explanations, and they were rejecting thingslike a supernatural concept of power, where it transmitted becauseof a very vague concept of birthright.", "en": " 非常明顯的是，如果你注意一下建國者的歷史, 他們當中許多人都對科學很感興趣, 並且他們都對自然主義世界這個概念 很感興趣。 他們摒棄超自然的說法, 他們排斥那些超自然力量的事情, 它被傳播 是基於非常模糊的身世的理念。"}, {"zh-tw": " They were movingtowards a naturalistic concept. And if you look, for example,in the Declaration of Independence, they talk about nature and nature's God.", "en": " 他們宣導自然主義的概念。 如果你觀察會發現，例如,在獨立宣言中, 他們提及到自然和自然之神。"}, {"zh-tw": " They don't talk about Godand God's nature. They're talking about the power of natureto tell us who we are.", "en": " 他們沒有提到上帝和上帝的自然。 他們提到自然的力量 來解釋我們是誰。"}, {"zh-tw": " So as part of that,they were coming to us with a concept that was about anatomical commonality. And in doing so, they were reallysetting up in a beautiful way the Civil Rights Movement of the future.", "en": " 因此作為其中的一部分, 他們為我們帶來一個概念, 那就是人人生來平等。 為此,他們確實為將來的民權運動 規劃了一個很美好的道路。"}, {"zh-tw": " They didn't think of it that way,but they did it for us, and it was great. So what happened years afterwards? What happened was women, for example,who wanted the right to vote, took the Founding Fathers' conceptof anatomical commonality being more importantthan anatomical difference and said, \"The fact that we havea uterus and ovaries is not significant enoughin terms of a difference to mean that we shouldn'thave the right to vote, the right to full citizenship,the right to own property, etc.\" And women successfully argued that.", "en": " 他們想不到將來會怎樣，但是他們為我們奠定了基礎，這是非常偉大的。 那麼數年後發生了什麼呢？ 例如在女性身上都發生了什麼, 她們渴望投票的權利, 按照建國者的概念 人人平等要遠重要於 人的出身, 她們說：「我們有子宮和卵巢是事實 這些不同完全不足以 意味著我們沒有投票權, 沒有充分的公民權利, 沒有私人財產權,等等。」 女性的主張獲得了成效。"}, {"zh-tw": " Next came the successfulCivil Rights Movement, where we found people like Sojourner Truth talking about, \"Ain't I a woman?\" We find men on the marching linesof the Civil Rights Movement saying, \"I am a man.\" Again, people of colorappealing to a commonality of anatomy over a difference of anatomy,again, successfully. We see the same thingwith the disability rights movement.", "en": " 接下來便是成功的民權運動, 運動中出現了像索傑納·特露絲這樣的人, 她的名言:「我就不是女人嗎？」 我們知道男人 曾經在民權運動的發展路線上 有句名言「我是個男人」。 此外，有色人群 呼籲人人平等而不應種族歧視, 再者， 我們看到同樣的成功案例發生在傷殘人士的權利運動中。"}, {"zh-tw": " The problem is, of course, that, as we begin to lookat all that commonality, we have to begin to questionwhy we maintain certain divisions. Mind you, I want to maintainsome divisions, anatomically, in our culture.", "en": " 問題是，當然, 當我們開始去審視所有的公民, 我們不得不開始質疑 為什麼我們去維護一個固定的界限。 現在，需要提醒大家的是，我希望在我們的文化範圍被內 去保持一些身體結構上的界限。"}, {"zh-tw": " For example, I don't want to give a fishthe same rights as a human.
