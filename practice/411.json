But you know what? That's just 12 percent of the population.", "en": " 但是你知道嗎？ 那只佔了總人口數的百分之十二而已"}, {"zh-tw": " We really have to ask the question: Can the world sustainthat number of automobiles? And if you look at projectionsover the next 10 to 15 to 20 years, it looks like the worldcar park could grow to on the order of 1.1 billion vehicles. If you park those end to endand wrap them around the Earth, that would stretcharound the Earth 125 times.", "en": " 我們真的必須問自己 這世界真的受得了那麼多的車子嗎？ 如果你看未來十年、十五年至二十年的預測 全球的停車場看起來會成長到可以容納11億輛汽車 如果你把他們一輛接一輛停在一起 然後讓他們環繞地球 大概可以繞地球125圈"}, {"zh-tw": " Now, we've made great progresswith automobile technology over the last 100 years.

We wanted somethingthat was really affordable.", "en": " 但是事實上 汽車的基本基因其實沒有改變太多 如果今天我們想要重新改造汽車，而不是像一百年前那樣的話 就我們對汽車相關問題的了解 以及對今日現有汽車技術的了解 我們會怎麼做呢? 我們想要一種真正負擔得起的車子 燃料電池看來很棒"}, {"zh-tw": " The fuel cell looked great: one-tenth as many moving parts, a fuel-cell propulsion systemas an internal combustion engine, and it emits just water.
