There is no competition here."}, {"zh-tw": "我將人生過去的二十年獻給巴西貘的保育與研究這一直以來都令人感到非常驚奇但現在，我很努力思考我的工作所帶來的影響", "en": "I have dedicatedthe past 20 years of my life to the research and conservationof tapirs in Brazil, and it has been absolutely amazing. But at the moment,I've been thinking really, really hard about the impact of my work."}, {"zh-tw": "我一直在問我自己，我對這些我這麼熱愛的動物的保育的真正貢獻我是否在保護牠們的生存上有效果我是否做得夠多？我想，這裡最大的問題是我是否真的在研究貘跟為牠們的存續做付出或者我只是在記錄牠們的滅種這個世界正在面對各式各樣的保育危機", "en": "I've been questioning myselfabout the real contributions I have made for the conservationof these animals I love so much. Am I being effective in safeguarding their survival? Am I doing enough? I guess the big question here is, am I studying tapirsand contributing to their conservation, or am I just documenting their extinction? The world is facingso many different conservation crises."}, {"zh-tw": "我們都知道，新聞每天都看得到熱帶雨林跟其他生態環境正在被破壞氣候變化，這麼多的物種正在滅種的邊緣老虎、獅子、大象、犀牛、貘", "en": "We all know that.It's all over the news every day. Tropical forests and other ecosystemsare being destroyed, climate change, so many specieson the brink of extinction: tigers, lions, elephants, rhinos, tapirs."}, {"zh-tw": "這是隻低地貘，跟我一起工作的貘種類是南美最大的陸生哺乳類動物牠們很大，很強大", "en": "This is the lowland tapir,the tapir species I work with, the largest terrestrial mammalof South America. They're massive. They're powerful."}, {"zh-tw": "成年的貘可以有三百公斤重那是馬大小的一半", "en": "Adults can weigh up to 300 kilos. That's half the size of a horse."}, {"zh-tw": "牠們很可愛貘大多數在亞馬遜的熱帶雨林中可以被找到牠們需要很大片的棲息地才可以找到所有牠們需要繁衍跟生存的資源", "en": "They're gorgeous. Tapirs are mostly foundin tropical forests such as the Amazon, and they absolutely needlarge patches of habitat in order to find all the resourcesthey need to reproduce and survive."}, {"zh-tw": "但牠們的棲息地正被破壞著而牠們已經被獵趕出許多牠們分布的地理區域你看，這真的是非常、非常的不幸因為牠們屬於的棲息地對牠們來說來說是相當重要的", "en": "But their habitat is being destroyed, and they have been hunted out of severalparts of their geographic distribution. And you see, this isvery, very unfortunate because tapirs are extremely importantfor the habitats where they are found."}, {"zh-tw": "牠們是草食動物水果占牠們飲食的百分之五十而當牠們吃水果時，牠們會吞下種子，牠們透過排泄物在牠們的棲息地散播這些種子", "en": "They're herbivores. Fifty percent of their dietconsists of fruit, and when they eat the fruit,they swallow the seeds, which they disperse throughoutthe habitat through their feces."}, {"zh-tw": "牠們在形塑和保持雨林的結構和多樣化中扮演主要的角色正因為如此，貘亦被視為是雨林的園丁這可不很驚人嗎？如果你想想貘的絕跡真的會嚴重的影響整個生物多樣性", "en": "They play this major rolein shaping and maintaining the structure and diversity of the forest, and for that reason, tapirs are knownas gardeners of the forest. Isn't that amazing? If you think about it, the extinction of tapirswould seriously affect biodiversity as a whole."}, {"zh-tw": "我在1996年開始從事關於貘的工作，我當時非常的年輕，才剛從大學畢業當時這是一項前端的研究和保育計畫當時，我們幾乎沒有關於貘的任何相關資訊大多因為牠們非常難被研究", "en": "I started my tapir work in 1996,still very young, fresh out of college, and it was a pioneer researchand conservation program.

But what is itthat a conservationist does? Well, first, we need data."}, {"zh-tw": "我們需要田野調查。我們需要這些長期的資料集來支持保育行動而我跟你們說過了，貘非常難被研究所以我們需要藉由間接方法來研究牠們", "en": "We need field research. We need those long-term datasetsto support conservation action, and I told you tapirsare very hard to study, so we have to relyon indirect methods to study them."}, {"zh-tw": "我們必須捕捉，麻醉牠們所以我們在牠們的脖子裝上了GPS頸鍊來追蹤牠們的行蹤這是世界上的保育人士都常使用的一個技術接著我們蒐集關於牠們如何使用空間的資訊牠們怎麼在地景上移動牠們的首要棲息地是什麼還有更多更多", "en": "We have to capture and anesthetize them so that we can install GPS collarsaround their necks and follow their movements, which is a technique used by manyother conservationists around the world.

We have to educate people about tapirs and how important these animals are."}, {"zh-tw": "而這真的很奇妙，這世上有這麼多的人並不知道貘是什麼事實上，許多人認為這是隻貘", "en": "And it's amazinghow many people around the world do not know what a tapir is. In fact, many people thinkthis is a tapir."}, {"zh-tw": "讓我告訴你們，這不是隻貘這是隻巨大的食蟻獸", "en": "Let me tell you, this is not a tapir. This is a giant anteater."}, {"zh-tw": "貘並不吃螞蟻。從未，永遠不會。再來，我們需要提供訓練，能力養成。", "en": "Tapirs do not eat ants. Never. Ever. And then next we have to providetraining, capacity building."}, {"zh-tw": "儲備未來的保育人士是我們的責任。我們在許多保育戰役上正在敗退而我們需要更多的人做我們在做的事情而且如果他們需要技能，如果他們有做這件事情的熱誠", "en": "It is our responsibility to preparethe conservationists of the future. We are losing severalconservation battles, and we need more people doing what we do, and they need the skills,and they need the passion to do that."}, {"zh-tw": "最終，我們保育人士我們必須可以應用我們的數據應用我們累積的知識來支持真正的保育行動我們的第一個貘計劃從大西洋雨林開始在巴西東部世上最受威脅的生物群落", "en": "Ultimately, we conservationists, we must be able to apply our data, to apply our accumulated knowledge to support actual conservation action.

This forest was almost completely cleared for timber, agriculture, cattle ranchingand the construction of cities, and today only seven percentof the Atlantic forest is still left standing."}, {"zh-tw": "所有的貘都是在非常、非常小的，孤立失聯的族群被找到在大西洋雨林，我們發現貘穿越牧農場的開放區域從雨林的一片到雨林的另一片", "en": "And tapirs are found in very, very small,isolated, disconnected populations. In the Atlantic Forest, we found outthat tapirs move through open areas of pastureland and agriculture going from one patch of forestto patch of forest."}, {"zh-tw": "所以我們在這一區主要的處理方式是使用我們的貘數據來找出潛在的地方來建造野生生物廊道在不同的雨林區域之間重新連結棲息地好讓貘以及許多其他的動物可以安全的穿越地景十二年之後的大西洋雨林在二零零八年，我們擴大了貘的保育心血到了潘塔納爾濕地在巴西的西部靠近與玻利維亞跟巴拉圭的邊界", "en": "So our main approach in this region was to use our tapir datato identify the potential places for the establishmentof wildlife corridors in between those patches of forest, reconnecting the habitat so that tapirs and many other animalscould cross the landscape safely. After 12 years in the Atlantic Forest, in 2008, we expanded our tapirconservation efforts to the Pantanal in the western part of Brazil near the border with Bolivia and Paraguay."}, {"zh-tw": "這是世上最大連續的淡水沖積平原令人不可置信的地方且是南美中低地貘的最重要堡壘之一在潘塔納爾的工作是非常振奮人心的經驗因為我們在那區域找到大又健康的貘族群而我們又可以在我們所可能找到的，最自然的條件下研究貘幾乎沒有威脅", "en": "This is the largest continuousfreshwater floodplain in the world, an incredible place and one of the most important strongholdsfor lowland tapirs in South America. And working in the Pantanalhas been extremely refreshing because we found large,healthy tapir populations in the area, and we have been able to study tapirs in the most natural conditionswe'll ever find, very much free of threats."}, {"zh-tw": "在潘塔納爾，除了GPS頸鏈外，我們還用其他方法紅外相機這相機裝有動作感測器當動物在相機前移動時照下牠們", "en": "In the Pantanal, besides the GPS collars,we are using another technique: camera traps. This camera is equippedwith a movement sensor and it photographs animalswhen they walk in front of it."}, {"zh-tw": "多虧了這些神奇的設備我們才得以捕捉這些珍貴的資訊關於貘繁衍以及社會組織這些是開發這些保育策略不可或缺的重要一環當今二零一五年，我們正再次擴展我們的行動到了巴西的喜拉多巴西中部的開放草原與矮灌木叢林", "en": "So thanks to these amazing devices, we have been ableto gather precious information about tapir reproductionand social organization which are very importantpieces of the puzzle when you're trying to developthose conservation strategies. And right now, 2015,we are expanding our work once again to the Brazilian Cerrado, the open grasslands and shrub forestsin the central part of Brazil."}, {"zh-tw": "今日，這區域是我國家經濟發展非常重要的中心也是自然棲地與野生族群正在被各種不同威脅快速鏟滅包含，又一次，牧牛大片甘蔗與大豆的種植偷獵、交通事故，這還只是一部分不知怎麼的，那裡仍有貘這給我很大的希望", "en": "Today this region is the very epicenterof economic development in my country, where natural habitatand wildlife populations are rapidly being eradicatedby several different threats, including once again cattle ranching, large sugarcane and soybean plantations, poaching, roadkill, just to name a few. And somehow, tapirs are still there, which gives me a lot of hope."}, {"zh-tw": "但我還是得說，在喜拉多開始這項計畫有點是在臉上打巴掌當你開車逛逛而你在公路上找到死掉的貘還有貘在甘蔗田中遊蕩的跡象牠們不該在那的當你跟小孩說，他們跟你說他們知道貘吃起來怎樣因為他們的家人偷獵並吃掉牠們這真的傷透了你的心", "en": "But I have to say that startingthis new program in the Cerrado was a bit of a slap in the face. When you drive around and you find dead tapirsalong the highways and signs of tapirs wandering aroundin the middle of sugarcane plantations where they shouldn't be, and you talk to kids and they tell youthat they know how tapir meat tastes because their families poach and eat them, it really breaks your heart."}, {"zh-tw": "在喜拉多的情境使我有了危機意識我正在逆流而游", "en": "The situation in the Cerradomade me realize -- it gave me the sense of urgency. I am swimming against the tide."}, {"zh-tw": "讓我意識到儘管這二十年來的辛苦工作試圖拯救這些動物，我們還是有許多的工作要做如果我們要避免牠們消逝我們必須找到解決這些問題的方法", "en": "It made me realize that despitetwo decades of hard work trying to save these animals,we still have so much work to do if we are to prevent themfrom disappearing. We have to find waysto solve all these problems."}, {"zh-tw": "我們已經在做了，但你知道嗎？我們真的來到保育領域中一個我們必須跳脫框架思考的地步我們將必需比我們現在更創新", "en": "We really do, and you know what? We really came to a pointin the conservation world where we have to think out of the box. We'll have to be a lot more creativethan we are right now."}, {"zh-tw": "讓我告訴你，路殺是對喜拉多的貘來說很大的一個問題所以我們有了在貘的GPS頸鍊上放置反射貼紙的想法這些跟大卡車上的貼紙是一樣的來避免相撞", "en": "And I told you, roadkill is a big problemfor tapirs in the Cerrado, so we just came up with the ideaof putting reflective stickers on the GPS collars we put on the tapirs. These are the same stickersused on big trucks to avoid collision."}, {"zh-tw": "貘在黑暗中穿越公路所以希望這些貼紙可以幫司機們看清這個閃亮的東西正在穿越公路而他們可以放慢速度些此時此刻，這只是個瘋狂的點子", "en": "Tapirs cross the highways after dark, so the stickers will hopefullyhelp drivers see this shining thing crossing the highway, and maybe they willslow down a little bit. For now, this is just a crazy idea."}, {"zh-tw": "我們不知道。但我們會看這是否可以減少貘的路殺但重點是，也許這正是需要被實行的事", "en": "We don't know. We'll see if it willreduce the amount of tapir roadkill. But the point is, maybe this isthe kind of stuff that needs to be done."}, {"zh-tw": "而儘管我仍然對這些問題仍有掙扎現在在我心裡我跟貘有項協議我知道我的心就是貘的保育是我的目標", "en": "And although I'm strugglingwith all these questions in my mind right now, I have a pact with tapirs. I know in my heart that tapir conservation is my cause."}, {"zh-tw": "這是我的熱情我並不是一個人", "en": "This is my passion. I am not alone."}, {"zh-tw": "我有這麼龐大的支持網路在我身後我絕不可能停止可能我接下來的人生我都會繼續做著", "en": "I have this huge networkof supporters behind me, and there is no wayI'm ever going to stop.
