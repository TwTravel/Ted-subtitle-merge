This is a dream of the ages. But scientists have for a long time thought this just was never going to be possible.", "en": " 在座諸位是否曾想過要延長自己的青春 延緩衰老? 這是長久以來的夢想 但科學家長期以來 都認為這個夢想永遠都不會實現"}, {"zh-tw": " They thought you just wear out, there's nothing you can do about it -- kind of like an old shoe. But if you look in nature, you see that different kinds of animals can have really different lifespans.", "en": " 人一定都會老嘛 這是無法改變的事情 就像一隻舊鞋 但如果你觀察大自然 會發現不同的動物 壽命長短大不相同"}, {"zh-tw": " Now these animals are different from one another, because they have different genes. So that suggests that somewhere in these genes, somewhere in the DNA, are genes for aging, genes that allow them to have different lifespans.", "en": " 這些動物之所以不同 是因為牠們的基因不同 可想而知 在這些基因的某處 DNA的某處 存在著導致衰老的基因 讓不同的動物有不同的壽命"}, {"zh-tw": " So if there are genes like that, then you can imagine that, if you could change one of the genes in an experiment, an aging gene, maybe you could slow down aging and extend lifespan. And if you could do that, then you could find the genes for aging.", "en": " 如果這些基因真的存在 想像一下 如果你在實驗中改變其中一個基因 一個導致衰老的基因 就有可能延緩衰老 延長壽命 如果你能這麼做 就可以找到導致衰老的基因"}, {"zh-tw": " And if they exist and you can find them, then maybe one could eventually do something about it. So we've set out to look for genes that control aging.", "en": " 如果真有這種基因而且又被你找到 也許我們就可以藉此大有一番作為 因此我們準備尋找可以控制衰老的基因"}, {"zh-tw": " And we didn't study any of these animals. Instead, we studied a little, tiny, round worm called C. elegans, which is just about the size of a comma in a sentence.", "en": " 我們沒有研究其它動物 反而研究了又細又小 身體圓圓的秀麗線蟲 牠的尺寸大約只有句子裡的逗點那麼大"}, {"zh-tw": " And we were really optimistic that we could find something because there had been a report of a long-lived mutant. So we started to change genes at random, looking for long-lived animals.", "en": " 我們非常樂觀地認為可以有新發現 因為已經有一篇報告紀錄了長壽的突變體 我們開始隨意地改變基因 尋找長壽的動物"}, {"zh-tw": " And we were very lucky to find that mutations that damage one single gene called daf-2 doubled the lifespan of the little worm. So you can see in black, after a month -- they're very short-lived; that's why we like to study them for studies of aging -- in black, after a month, the normal worms are all dead.", "en": " 而且非常幸運地發現 如果一個名叫daf-2的基因在突變時被破壞 小蟲的壽命就可以延長一倍 請各位看黑線 一個月後─ 這種蟲的壽命很短 所以適合拿來做研究 研究老化現象─ 黑線顯示 一個月後 一般的蟲都死了"}, {"zh-tw": " But at that time, most of the mutant worms are still alive. And it isn't until twice as long that they're all dead.", "en": " 但與此同時 大部分的突變蟲仍然還活著 而且會活多一倍的時間 才死去"}, {"zh-tw": " And now I want to show what they actually look like in this movie here.

It takes this worm two days to age as much as the normal worm ages in one day.", "en": " 很酷對吧 牠衰老得比較慢 這隻蟲要兩天的時間 來完成一般蠕蟲一天內衰老的程度"}, {"zh-tw": " And when I tell people about this, they tend to think of maybe an 80 or 90 year-old person who looks really good for being 90 or 80.

Okay.", "en": " 你絕對不會知道 除非她告訴你 好吧"}, {"zh-tw": " So what is the daf-2 gene? Well as you know, genes, which are part of the DNA, they're instructions to make a protein that does something. And the daf-2 gene encodes a hormone receptor.", "en": " daf-2基因到底是什麼呢? 各位應該都知道 基因是DNA的一部分 告訴蛋白質應該做什麼 而這個daf-2基因 控制荷爾蒙接收器"}, {"zh-tw": " So what you see in the picture there is a cell with a hormone receptor in red punching through the edge of the cell. So part of it is like a baseball glove.", "en": " 這張圖片上你可以看到 一個細胞 紅色的是荷爾蒙接收器 正穿過細胞的邊緣 它有一部分像棒球手套一樣"}, {"zh-tw": " Part of it's on the outside, and it's catching the hormone as it comes by in green. And the other part is on the inside where it sends signals into the cell.", "en": " 這一部分在外面 抓住經過的荷爾蒙 就是綠色的部分 另一部份在裡面 向細胞發送信號"}, {"zh-tw": " Okay, so what is the daf-2 receptor telling the inside of the cell? I just told you that, if you make a mutation in the daf-2 gene cell, that you get a receptor that doesn't work as well; the animal lives longer. So that means that the normal function of this hormone receptor is to speed up aging.", "en": " daf-2接收器 到底在向細胞內部發送什麼信號呢? 我剛剛說 如果你讓daf-2基因細胞產生突變 讓接收器失效 這隻蟲就可以活比較久 表示這種荷爾蒙接收器的正常功能 就是加速老化"}, {"zh-tw": " That's what that arrow means. It speeds up aging. It makes it go faster.", "en": " 箭頭就是這個意思 它會加速老化 讓老化更快發生"}, {"zh-tw": " So it's like the animal has the grim reaper inside of itself, speeding up aging. So this is altogether really, really interesting.", "en": " 就好像蟲子體內有個死神一樣 加快老化 所以這一切非常 非常有趣"}, {"zh-tw": " It says that aging is subject to control by the genes, and specifically by hormones. So what kind of hormones are these? There's lots of hormones. There's testosterone, adrenalin.", "en": " 表示老化是由基因控制 更精確一點是荷爾蒙 那這是哪一類的荷爾蒙呢？ 荷爾蒙有很多種 睪丸激素 腎上腺素"}, {"zh-tw": " You know about a lot of them. These hormones are similar to hormones that we have in our bodies.", "en": " 還有很多大家都熟知的 控制老化的荷爾蒙 和我們體內的荷爾蒙很相似"}, {"zh-tw": " The daf-2 hormone receptor is very similar to the receptor for the hormone insulin and IGF-1. Now you've all heard of at least insulin.", "en": " daf-2荷爾蒙接收器 跟其它接收器很像 尤其是專門感應胰島素和IGF-1的接收器 大家應該至少都聽過胰島素"}, {"zh-tw": " Insulin is a hormone that promotes the uptake of nutrients into your tissues after you eat a meal. And the hormone IGF-1 promotes growth.", "en": " 這種荷爾蒙是促進養分吸收的 吃完飯後 身體組織就可以吸收養分 IGF-1促進生長"}, {"zh-tw": " So these functions were known for these hormones for a long time, but our studies suggested that maybe they had a third function that nobody knew about -- maybe they also affect aging. And it's looking like that's the case.", "en": " 這些荷爾蒙的功能是大家長久以來耳熟能詳的 但是我們的研究指出 也許還有不為人知道的第三種功能 會影響老化 我們現在面對的似乎就是這種可能性"}, {"zh-tw": " So after we made our discoveries with little C. elegans, people who worked on other kinds of animals started asking, if we made the same daf-2 mutation, the hormone receptor mutation, in other animals, will they live longer? And that is the case in flies. If you change this hormone pathway in flies, they live longer.", "en": " 從小線蟲身上有了新發現後 研究其他動物的科學家 開始思考 如果讓相同的daf-2突變 就是荷爾蒙接收器突變 也在其他動物身上發生 其他動物也會更長壽嗎？ 蒼蠅的確如此 如果改變荷爾蒙接收的路徑 蒼蠅可以活更久"}, {"zh-tw": " And also in mice -- and mice are mammals like us. So it's an ancient pathway, because it must have arisen a long time ago in evolution such that it still works in all these animals.", "en": " 老鼠也是 而老鼠跟人一樣是哺乳類 所以接收路徑想必十分古老 因為一定是在演化早期就發展出來的機制 才會在所有動物身上都有效"}, {"zh-tw": " And also, the common precursor also gave rise to people. So maybe it's working in people the same way.", "en": " 同樣地 人類也是由相同的祖先演化而來 所以也許對人類也有效"}, {"zh-tw": " And there are hints of this. So for example, there was one study that was done in a population of Ashkenazi Jews in New York City.", "en": " 我們也的確看到這種跡象 例如 某項研究的對象 是紐約市的阿胥肯納吉猶太人族群"}, {"zh-tw": " And just like any population, most of the people live to be about 70 or 80, but some live to be 90 or 100. And what they found was that people who lived to 90 or 100 were more likely to have daf-2 mutations -- that is, changes in the gene that encodes the receptor for IGF-1.", "en": " 就跟其他人口族群一樣 大部分人可以活到70或80歲 但有些可以活到90或100歲 學者發現 那些活到90或100歲的人 比較可能有daf-2的突變 就是說 基因發生改變 造成接收IGF-1的不同"}, {"zh-tw": " And these changes made the gene not act as well as the normal gene would have acted. It damaged the gene.", "en": " 這些改變使基因不產生作用 不像一般正常的基因 它們破壞了基因"}, {"zh-tw": " So those are hints suggesting that humans are susceptible to the effects of the hormones for aging. So the next question, of course, is: Is there any effect on age-related disease? As you age, you're much more likely to get cancer, Alzheimer's disease, heart disease, all sorts of diseases.", "en": " 這些暗示 表示人類也可能受到影響 控制老化的荷爾蒙對人類也有效 因此更進一步的問題 當然就是 它對於與年齡相關的疾病有沒有效用？ 當我們逐漸老化 會更有可能得到 癌症 阿茲海默症 心臟疾病 或其他各種疾病"}, {"zh-tw": " It turns out that these long-lived mutants are more resistant to all these diseases. They hardly get cancer, and when they do it's not as severe.", "en": " 我們發現長壽的突變種 更有能力對抗這些疾病 牠們很少得癌症 即使得了也比較不嚴重"}, {"zh-tw": " So it's really interesting, and it makes sense in a way, that they're still young, so why would they be getting diseases of aging until their old? So it suggests that, if we could have a therapeutic or a pill to take to replicate some of these effects in humans, maybe we would have a way of combating lots of different age-related diseases all at once. So how can a hormone ultimately affect the rate of aging? How could that work? Well it turns out that in the daf-2 mutants, a whole lot of genes are switched on in the DNA that encode proteins that protect the cells and the tissues, and repair damage.", "en": " 這是很有趣的現象 其實也很有道理 因為牠們還很年輕 所以當然不會有各種老化的病症 這也表示 如果有某種療法或藥物 可以複製這些效果到人體上 也許就有辦法 對抗許多與年齡有關的各種疾病 一勞永逸 那麼 荷爾蒙到底怎麼影響老化的速度呢？ 它是如何運作的？ 我們發現在daf-2突變種生物中 某個DNA上的許多基因都在運作 這個DNA負責控制蛋白質 保護細胞和組織 修復損傷"}, {"zh-tw": " And the way that they're switched on is by a gene regulator protein called FOXO. So in a daf-2 mutant -- you see that I have the X drawn here through the receptor.", "en": " 這些基因的運作 是由控制基因的蛋白質FOXO掌管 因此在daf-2突變種中─ 這裡可以看到接收器上面打了個叉"}, {"zh-tw": " The receptor isn't working as well. Under those conditions, the FOXO protein in blue has gone into the nucleus -- that little compartment there in the middle of the cell -- and it's sitting down on a gene binding to it.", "en": " 接收器沒有作用 在這種環境中 FOXO蛋白質 就是藍色的部分 進入了細胞核 就是細胞中心的小空間 它留在這裡 帶著一個基因"}, {"zh-tw": " You see one gene. There are lots of genes actually that bind on FOXO. And it's just sitting on one of them.", "en": " 你只看到一個 其實FOXO上帶著很多基因 它只留了一個"}, {"zh-tw": " So FOXO turns on a lot of genes. And the genes it turns on includes antioxidant genes, genes I call carrot-giver genes, whose protein products actually help other proteins to function well -- to fold correctly and function correctly.", "en": " FOXO啟動許多基因的功能 包括抗氧化的基因 還有我稱為「成人之美」的基因 它的蛋白質產出物 可以幫助其他蛋白質維持良好運作 正確疊合 正常運作"}, {"zh-tw": " And it can also escort them to the garbage cans of the cell and recycle them if they're damaged. DNA repair genes are more active in these animals.", "en": " 還可以確保其他蛋白質廢棄後在細胞中被處理掉 或在蛋白質受損時進行回收 修復DNA的基因 在這些動物體內比較活躍"}, {"zh-tw": " And the immune system is more active. And many of these different genes, we've shown, actually contribute to the long lifespan of the daf-2 mutant.", "en": " 免疫系統也比較活躍 許多這些不同的基因 已經證實 確實造成daf-2變種生物較長的壽命"}, {"zh-tw": " So it's really interesting. These animals have within them the latent capacity to live much longer than they normally do.", "en": " 這是非常有趣的發現 這些動物體內 潛藏著可以活更久的能力"}, {"zh-tw": " They have the ability to protect themselves from many kinds of damage, which we think makes them live longer. So what about the normal worm? Well when the daf-2 receptor is active, then it triggers a series of events that prevent FOXO from getting into the nucleus where the DNA is.", "en": " 牠們有能力 保護自己免於各種傷害 我們認為這是牠們長壽的原因 那一般正常的蟲子呢？ 當daf-2接收器啟動時 會觸發一連串反應 防止FOXO 進入細胞核 也就是DNA所在的位置"}, {"zh-tw": " So it can't turn the genes on. That's how it works. That's why we don't see the long lifespan, until we have the daf-2 mutant.", "en": " 因此基因不會被啟動 這就是它運作的方法 也因此如果要長壽 一定要有daf-2的變異"}, {"zh-tw": " But what good is this for the worm? Well we think that insulin and IGF-1 hormones are hormones that are particularly active under favorable conditions -- in the good times -- when food is plentiful and there's not a lot of stress in the environment. Then they promote the uptake of nutrients.", "en": " 但這對蟲子有什麼好處？ 如果我們回頭看看胰島素和IGF-1激素 這兩種特別活躍的荷爾蒙 在有利的條件下 良好的情況中 如果食物充足 環境中又沒有太大的壓力時 它們會促進養分的吸收"}, {"zh-tw": " You can store the food, use it for energy, grow, etc. But what we think is that, under conditions of stress, the levels of these hormones drop -- for example, having limited food supply.", "en": " 儲存食物 轉換成能量 幫助生長 等等 但我們考慮的是 如果受到壓力影響 荷爾蒙濃度下降 例如 食物來源不足"}, {"zh-tw": " And that, we think, is registered by the animal as a danger signal, a signal that things are not okay and that it should roll out its protective capacity. So it activates FOXO, FOXO goes to the DNA, and that triggers the expression of these genes that improves the ability of the cell to protect itself and repair itself.", "en": " 這種情形 我們認為 動物本能地就會將之視為警訊 提醒牠們情況不對勁 牠應該施展自我保護的能力 因此FOXO開始運作 對DNA產生作用 觸發這些基因表現 改善細胞能力 更能自我保護與修復"}, {"zh-tw": " And that's why we think the animals live longer. So you can think of FOXO as being like a building superintendent.", "en": " 我們認為 動物因此能活更久 所以 你可以把FOXO 當成大樓的管理員"}, {"zh-tw": " So maybe he's a little bit lazy, but he's there, he's taking care of the building. But it's deteriorating.", "en": " 也許這位管理員有點懶惰 不過他人在大樓裡 有在管事 大樓慢慢老舊"}, {"zh-tw": " And then suddenly, he learns that there's going to be a hurricane. So he doesn't actually do anything himself.", "en": " 然後突然 管理員得知有颶風要來 他自己實際上什麼都不做"}, {"zh-tw": " He gets on the telephone -- just like FOXO gets on the DNA -- and he calls up the roofer, the window person, the painter, the floor person. And they all come and they fortify the house.", "en": " 而是拿起電話 就像FOXO刺激DNA一樣 然後打電話 叫修屋頂 修窗戶的工人 油漆工 地板工 通通都過來 強化大樓"}, {"zh-tw": " And then the hurricane comes through, and the house is in much better condition than it would normally have been in. And not only that, it can also just last longer, even if there isn't a hurricane.", "en": " 之後颶風過境 不過大樓的狀況比平時改善許多 不只如此 它還可以維持更久 有沒有颶風都一樣"}, {"zh-tw": " So that's the concept here for how we think this life extension ability exists. Now the really cool thing about FOXO is that there are different forms of it.", "en": " 我要說明的概念就是如此 所謂延長壽命的能力就是這樣 FOXO了不起的地方 是它有各種不同的型態"}, {"zh-tw": " We all have FOXO genes, but we don't all have exactly the same form of the FOXO gene. Just like we all have eyes, but some of us have blue eyes and some of us have brown eyes.", "en": " 我們都有FOXO的基因 但是型態並不完全一樣 就像我們都有眼睛 但有些人的眼睛是藍色的 有些人的眼睛是棕色的"}, {"zh-tw": " And there are certain forms of the FOXO gene that have found to be more frequently present in people who live to be 90 or 100. And that's the case all over the world, as you can see from these stars.", "en": " 某些形態的FOXO基因 我們發現 它們最常出現的地方 是在90或100歲人瑞的體內 這種狀況 全世界都一樣 這張圖上的星星就足以說明"}, {"zh-tw": " And each one of these stars represents a population where scientists have asked, \"Okay, are there differences in the type of FOXO genes among people who live a really long time?\" and there are. We don't know the details of how this works, but we do know then that FOXO genes can impact the lifespan of people.", "en": " 每一顆星代表一個人口族群 科學家在這些地方研究： 「這裡的FOXO基因 在長壽人口體內是否都不同？」的確如此 我們不清楚這一切運作的細節 但我們知道 FOXO基因可以影響 人類的壽命"}, {"zh-tw": " And that means that, maybe if we tweak it a little bit, we can increase the health and longevity of people. So this is really exciting to me.", "en": " 這就表示 如果我們善加利用這一點 就可以改善人類的健康 增加壽命 這一點讓我非常興奮"}, {"zh-tw": " A FOXO is a protein that we found in these little, round worms to affect lifespan, and here it affects lifespan in people. So we've been trying in our lab now to develop drugs that will activate this FOXO cell using human cells now in order to try and come up with drugs that will delay aging and age-related diseases.", "en": " FOXO這種蛋白質 在圓形小蟲子體內找到的 會影響壽命 也可以影響人類的壽命 所以我們現在在實驗室 試著研發藥物 可以刺激FOXO 改用人類細胞 才能進一步研發藥品 延緩老化 和與年齡相關的疾病"}, {"zh-tw": " And I'm really optimistic that this is going to work. There are lots of different proteins that are known to affect aging.", "en": " 我對於此事能否成功相當樂觀 現在已知有許多不同的蛋白質都會影響老化"}, {"zh-tw": " And for at least one of them, there is a drug. There's one called TOR, which is another nutrient sensor, like the insulin pathway.", "en": " 至少對其中一種 可以用藥物控制 這種蛋白質叫TOR 也是一種感應養分的蛋白質 類似胰島素路徑"}, {"zh-tw": " And mutations that damage the TOR gene -- just like the daf-2 mutations -- extend lifespan in worms and flies and mice. But in this case, there's already a drug called rapamycin that binds to the TOR protein and inhibits its activity.", "en": " 如果TOR基因被突變破壞 就會跟daf-2突變體一樣 可以延長蟲子的壽命 對蒼蠅和老鼠也都有效 但是在這種情況 已經有一種叫rapamycin的免疫抑制劑 會附著在TOR蛋白質上 抑制它的活動"}, {"zh-tw": " And you can take rapamycin and give it to a mouse -- even when it's pretty old, like age 60 for a human, that old for a mouse -- if you give the mouse rapamycin, it will live longer. Now I don't want you all to go out taking rapamycin.", "en": " 如果你讓老鼠服用這種免疫抑制劑 即使老鼠已經很老 像個60歲的人 即使這種年齡的老鼠 如果服用免疫抑制劑 也會活更久 不過我並不是叫你們趕快去服用rapamycin"}, {"zh-tw": " It is a drug for people, but the reason is it suppresses the immune system. So people take it to prevent organ transplants from being rejected.", "en": " 它的確是人類使用的藥物 但是它會抑制免疫系統 因此用來避免接受器官移植的病人產生排斥現象"}, {"zh-tw": " So this may not be the perfect drug for staying young longer. But still, here in the year 2011, there's a drug that you can give to mice at a pretty old age that will extend their lifespan, which comes out of this science that's been done in all these different animals.", "en": " 因此它不是靈丹妙藥 不是青春長駐的最佳選擇 但是 現在是2011年 的確有一種藥 如果給年事已高的老鼠服用 可以延長牠們的壽命 在研究中也證實 對其他各種不同的動物也有效"}, {"zh-tw": " So I'm really optimistic, and I think it won't be too long, I hope, before this age-old dream begins to come true. Thank you.", "en": " 因此我相當樂觀 也認為我們的夢想已經近在咫尺 長久以來青春長在的夢想即將成真 謝謝各位"}, {"zh-tw": " Matt Ridley: Thank you, Cynthia. Let me get this straight.", "en": " 麥特‧雷德利：謝謝妳 辛西亞 讓我澄清一下情況"}, {"zh-tw": " Although you're looking for a drug that can solve aging in old men like me, what you could do now pretty well in the lab, if you were allowed ethically, is start a human life from scratch with altered genes that would make it live for a lot longer?

So if you stop taking the drug, the protein would go back to normal.", "en": " 你在尋找的這種藥 可以解決老化的問題 對我種老頭子也有效 現在你在實驗室中已經可以做到 當然在不違背道德的前提下 無中生有創造一個人 並擁有改變過的基因 讓它可以活更久嗎？ 辛西亞：我剛剛說明的那種藥 不會改變基因 只會附著在蛋白質上 改變其功能 所以如果你停止服藥 蛋白質就會恢復成正常的狀態"}, {"zh-tw": " You could change the genes in principle. There isn't the technology to do that.", "en": " 你也可以從基因上徹底改變 不過現在還沒有這種科技"}, {"zh-tw": " But I don't think that's a good idea.

And nobody knows if they really can live forever, or what keeps them from aging.", "en": " 其他還有很多這類動物的例子 像是燕鷗 或者其他鳥類就像這樣 沒有人知道牠們是否可以長生不死 或為何牠們不會老化"}, {"zh-tw": " It's not clear. If you look at birds, which live a long time, cells from the birds tend to be more resistant to a lot of different environmental stresses like high temperature or hydrogen peroxide, things like that.", "en": " 現在還不清楚 如果你觀察鳥類 長壽的鳥類 牠們的細胞通常較具抵抗力 可以應對許多環境壓力 例如高溫 或過氧化氫這類的東西"}, {"zh-tw": " And our long-lived mutants are too.
