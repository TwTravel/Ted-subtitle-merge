Connecting in sips may work for gathering discrete bits of information, they may work for saying, \"I'm thinking about you,\" or even for saying, \"I love you,\" -- I mean, look at how I felt when I got that text from my daughter -- but they don't really work for learning about each other, for really coming to know and understand each other.", "en": " 他說“這些零零碎碎的短句 這些片斷的章句 不都是溝通的一部分？ 而最後總會合成一個 完整的真實對話？“ 我的回答是否定的 他們沒有加總的效果 用零零碎碎的片段來溝通 在傳遞較簡短隱私的資訊時或許可行 用來説說“我在想你”可能可以 甚至說“我愛你”也還可以 我的意思是說 看看我女兒的簡訊讓我多麽高興 但是這些隻字片語 是沒有辦法讓我們了解對方的 不能讓我們真正互相了解和認識"}, {"zh-tw": " And we use conversations with each other to learn how to have conversations with ourselves.

We're lonely, but we're afraid of intimacy.", "en": " 而我們是脆弱的 我們感到孤獨 但又害怕親密"}, {"zh-tw": " And so from social networks to sociable robots, we're designing technologies that will give us the illusion of companionship without the demands of friendship.
