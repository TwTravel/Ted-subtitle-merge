I don't keep everything but for some reason I haven't opened this box.", "en": " 但我已經擁有它那麼久了 我會盯著它看, 擺在辦公室裡的櫃子上 然後我不禁自問, 為什麼我不把盒子打開? 我為什麼要留著它, 我又不是收藏狂, 我不會把東西都留起來 但不知怎麼地, 我從未想要把它打開"}, {"zh-tw": " And I felt like there was a key to this, somehow, in talking about something at TED that I haven't discussed before, and bored people elsewhere. So I thought, maybe there's something with this. I started thinking about it.", "en": " 我覺得那似乎是一個契機 可以來TED談談我未曾談過的事 也沒有在其他地方拿去煩別人的 所以我想也許這有什麼意義, 我開始思索"}, {"zh-tw": " And there was this giant question mark. I love the design, for what it's worth, of this thing. And I started thinking, why haven't I opened it? And I realized that I haven't opened it because it represents something important -- to me.

But -- -- the thing is, that it represents infinite possibility.", "en": " 盒子上有個很大的問號, 我喜歡它的設計 我開始想, 那我為何不打開它呢? 然後我了解到我沒有打開這盒子, 是因為它代表了某種重要的意義 對我來說, 它代表了我的外公 我可以在TED這裡大哭嗎? 噢, 我不會哭啦 但它其實代表了無限的可能"}, {"zh-tw": " It represents hope.

Now, it's not the most ground-breaking idea, but when I started to think that maybe there are times when mystery is more important than knowledge, I started getting interested in this.", "en": " 我了解到未知其實就是激發想像力的導引 這並不是什麼石破天驚的想法 但當我開始思考也許有時未知的力量 比知識還要強大, 我開始對此產生興趣"}, {"zh-tw": " And so I started thinking about \"Lost,\" and the stuff that we do, and I realized, oh my God, mystery boxes are everywhere in what I do! In how -- in the creation of \"Lost,\" Damon Lindelof and I, who created the show with me, we were basically tasked with creating this series that we had very little time to do. We had 11 and a half weeks to write it, cast it, crew it, shoot it, cut it, post it, turn in a two-hour pilot. So it was not a lot of time. And that sense of possibility -- what could this thing be? There was no time to develop it.", "en": " 所以我開始發想關於Lost檔案及其他我們所做的 我了解到, 噢天啊, 在我所致力的一切裡, 到處都是神祕盒子 在發想Lost檔案初期, 我和達蒙林德洛夫 我們一起製作這部影集, 在初期是困難重重的 沒有什麼時間去做, 我們只有約11個禮拜 把劇本寫好, 選演員, 找團隊, 拍攝, 剪輯成兩小時的首播集 所以真的沒多少時間去做.不知道事情會變得如何？ 我們並沒有其他時間將其發展下去"}, {"zh-tw": " I'm sure you're all familiar with those people who tell you what you can't do and what you should change. And there was no time for that, which is kind of amazing.", "en": " 我想大家都已經都很熟悉 總會有人告訴你哪些事不能做, 應該改變什麼 但已經沒有時間去調整, 其實也很神奇"}, {"zh-tw": " And so we did this show, and for those of you who, you know, who haven't seen it, or don't know it, I can show you this one little clip from the pilot, just to show you some stuff that we did. Claire: Help! Please help me! Help me! Help me! Jack: Get him out of here! Get him away from the engine! Get him out of here! C: I'm having contractions! J: How many months pregnant are you? C: I'm only eight months.", "en": " 我們製作了這部影集, 對那些沒有看過的人 或沒聽過的人, 我在這裡秀一段首集的片段 讓大家對我們所做的東西更為了解 救命阿！救命！ 把他帶離這裡, 不要待在引擎旁 , 快把他移開 我好像快要生了 你現在幾個月的身孕了？ 只有八個月"}, {"zh-tw": " J: And how far apart are they coming? C: I don't know. I think it just happened. Man: Hey! Hey! Hey, get away from -- JJA: Now, 10 years ago, if we wanted to do that, we'd have to kill a stuntman.", "en": " 陣痛的時間多久了？ 我不知道, 我想是剛剛才開始的 嘿！趕快離開 十年前如果我們要拍這場戲, 可能就得殺一位替身"}, {"zh-tw": " We'd actually -- it would be harder. It would take -- Take 2 would be a bitch. So the amazing thing was, we were able to do this thing.", "en": " 事實上... 這會更加的困難, 如果還NG就完了 神奇的地方在於我們可以完成這樣的事"}, {"zh-tw": " And part of that was the amazing availability of technology, knowing we could do anything. I mean, we could never have done that. We might have been able to write it; we wouldn't have been able to depict it like we did. And so part of the amazing thing for me is in the creative process, technology is, like, mind-blowingly inspiring to me.", "en": " 部分原因得歸功於現代科技的發達 讓我們無所不能, 從前我們是無法做到的 以前我們也許可以描述出來, 但我們無法精準的體現 我覺得另一個神奇的是創意的產出過程 對我來說, 科技激發我強烈的靈感"}, {"zh-tw": " I realize that that blank page is a magic box, you know? It needs to be filled with something fantastic. I used to have the \"Ordinary People\" script that I'd flip through.", "en": " 我了解到空白頁其實就是個神祕盒子 得填上許多絕妙的點子 我曾經翻閱電影『凡夫俗子』的劇本"}, {"zh-tw": " The romance of the script was amazing to me; it would inspire me. I wanted to try and fill pages with the same kind of spirit and thought and emotion that that script did.", "en": " 電影裡的浪漫劇情讓我很感動, 激發了我 我曾試著想要寫出與那部電影具有相同精神 想法與情感的東西"}, {"zh-tw": " You know, I love Apple computers. I'm obsessed. So the Apple computer -- like those -- the PowerBook -- this computer, right, it challenges me. It basically says, what are you going to write worthy of me? I guess I feel this -- I'm compelled.", "en": " 我喜歡蘋果電腦, 我是個蘋果迷 蘋果電腦, 像這台Powerbook 讓我倍感威脅, 好像在對我說 你能寫出什麼配的上我的東西？ 我想自己被奴役了"}, {"zh-tw": " And I often am like, you know, dude, today I'm out. I got nothing. You know? So there's that. In terms of the content of it, you look at stories, you think, well, what are stories but mystery boxes? There's a fundamental question -- in TV, the first act is called the teaser. It's literally the teaser. It's the big question.", "en": " 我常常會, 就像:老兄,我沒輒了, 我想不出來 關於事物的內容. 當你看到故事情節, 你會想 故事不就是神祕盒子嗎？ 這是個非常根本的問題, 在電視圈, 第一幕就要夠吸引觀眾 基本上就是丟出一個問題"}, {"zh-tw": " So you're drawn into it. Then of course, there's another question. And it goes on and on. Look at \"Star Wars.\" You got the droids; they meet the mysterious woman.", "en": " 來吸引觀眾 然後接著又會有另一個謎團, 不停地接踵而至 像『星際大戰』裡有機器人, 他們遇見了個神祕女性"}, {"zh-tw": " Who's that? We don't know. Mystery box! You know? Then you meet Luke Skywalker. He gets the Droid, you see the holographic image. You learn, oh, it's a message, you know.", "en": " 那是誰, 我們不知道. 是神祕盒子！ 接著還有天行者, 他有了機器人, 然後我們就看到一幅立體影像 你才發覺, 噢！這是個寓意"}, {"zh-tw": " She wants to, you know, find Obi Wan Kenobi. He's her only hope. But who the hell's Obi Wan Kenobi? Mystery box! So then you go and he meets Ben Kenobi. Ben Kenobi is Obi Wan Kenobi.", "en": " 她想要找到歐比王肯諾比. 他是她唯一的希望 但那個歐比王到底是誰？ 神祕盒子！ 然後他又遇見了班肯諾比. 班肯諾比就是歐比王肯諾比"}, {"zh-tw": " Holy shit! You know -- so it keeps us -- -- have you guys not seen that? It's huge! Anyway -- So there's this thing with mystery boxes that I started feeling compelled. Then there's the thing of mystery in terms of imagination -- the withholding of information. You know, doing that intentionally is much more engaging.", "en": " 老天啊！這讓我們... 你們難道沒看過嗎？ 這部片很紅耶 我覺得神祕盒子有某種力量驅動著我 有些事像神祕與想像 都其實蘊含意義 有目的性的去做而不僅僅只是參與而已"}, {"zh-tw": " Whether it's like the shark in \"Jaws\" -- if Spielberg's mechanical shark, Bruce, had worked, it would not be remotely as scary; you would have seen it too much. In \"Alien\", they never really showed the alien: terrifying! Even in a movie, like a romantic comedy, \"The Graduate,\" they're having that date, remember? And they're in the car, and it's loud, and so they put the top up.", "en": " 像是電影『大白鯊』裡的鯊魚 如果史匹柏的機器鯊魚,布魯斯能動的話 就不需要在遠處擺出嚇人的樣子, 也沒有太多鏡頭 而在電影『異形』裡, 從未出現過異形的樣子: 太可怕了！ 甚至是在一部愛情喜劇電影『畢業生』 記得他們正在約會那一幕嗎？ 他們坐在車裡, 周圍很吵雜, 所以他們把車頂拉起"}, {"zh-tw": " They're in there -- you don't hear anything they're saying! You can't hear a word! But it's the most romantic date ever. And you love it because you don't hear it. So to me, there's that.", "en": " 他們就坐在裡面,觀眾聽不到他們的談話, 什麼都聽不到 但這卻是最浪漫的約會經典畫面, 你會愛這一幕是因為你聽不到 所以這就是如此"}, {"zh-tw": " And then, finally, there's this idea -- stretching the sort of paradigm a little bit -- but the idea of the mystery box. Meaning, what you think you're getting, then what you're really getting.", "en": " 所以就是這個概念- 將這個概念應用的稍為廣一點 但神秘盒子的概念 代表你將會得到, 而且後來真的成真了"}, {"zh-tw": " And it's true in so many movies and stories. And when you look at \"E.T.,\" for example -- \"E.T.\" is this, you know, unbelievable movie about what? It's about an alien who meets a kid, right? Well, it's not. \"E.T.\" is about divorce. \"E.T.\" is about a heartbroken, divorce-crippled family, and ultimately, this kid who can't find his way.", "en": " 這在很多電影與故事都能印證 例如,『E.T.』這部電影, 這部電影是關於 一個外星人與小男孩相遇的故事對吧? 但其實不是, 這部電影其實是關於離婚, 關於一個 破碎家庭, 後來這個孩子無法找到生命出口的故事"}, {"zh-tw": " \"Die Hard,\" right? Crazy, great, fun, action-adventure movie in a building. It's about a guy who's on the verge of divorce.", "en": " 『終極警探』是部很瘋狂, 精彩有趣的動作冒險電影 但他其實是在描述一名男子正處於離婚邊緣"}, {"zh-tw": " He's showing up to L.A., tail between his legs. There are great scenes -- maybe not the most amazing dramatic scenes in the history of time, but pretty great scenes.", "en": " 垂頭喪氣地跑到洛杉磯 裡面有多精彩的畫面, 也許並不是史上 最佳的場面, 但也很不錯了"}, {"zh-tw": " There's a half an hour of investment in character before you get to the stuff that you're, you know, expecting. When you look at a movie like \"Jaws,\" the scene that you expect -- we have the screen? These are the kind of, you know, scenes that you remember and expect from \"Jaws.\" And she's being eaten; there's a shark.", "en": " 在真正好戲上場前, 該角色有約半小時的劇情鋪陳 你會有期待感 當在看像電影『大白鯊』 你會期待看到, 我們有畫面嗎? 這些就是我們會記得, 並且期待在『大白鯊』裡看到的場面 有一隻鯊魚, 她會被吃掉"}, {"zh-tw": " The thing about \"Jaws\" is, it's really about a guy who is sort of dealing with his place in the world -- with his masculinity, with his family, how he's going to, you know, make it work in this new town. This is one of my favorite scenes ever, and this is a scene that you wouldn't necessarily think of when you think of \"Jaws.\" But it's an amazing scene.", "en": " 『大白鯊』這部電影其實是關於一名男子 身上背負著家庭, 要在世界上找自己的定位 以及他如何在新環境中使一切成功 這是我最愛的一幕之一 我們通常不會把這一幕與『大白鯊』聯想在一起 但這真的很棒"}, {"zh-tw": " Father: C'mere. Give us a kiss. Son: Why? Father: 'Cause I need it.", "en": " 過來, 親爸爸一下 為什麼 因為我需要"}, {"zh-tw": " JJA: C'mon. \"Why? 'Cause I need it?\" Best scene ever, right? Come on! So you think of \"Jaws\" -- so that's the kind of stuff that, like, you know, the investment of character, which is the stuff that really is inside the box, you know? It's why when people do sequels, or rip off movies, you know, of a genre, they're ripping off the wrong thing. You're not supposed to rip off the shark or the monster.", "en": " 拜託, 『為什麼？因為我需要？』太棒了, 不是嗎？ 對吧！ 所以當你想到『大白鯊』 這種就是對人物個性的描述 這也就是藏在盒子裡的東西 這就是為什麼當要做電影續集或重拍老片時 他們都把重點擺錯 不應該只是複製鯊魚或怪獸"}, {"zh-tw": " You gotta rip off -- you know, if you rip something off -- rip off the character. Rip off the stuff that matters. I mean, look inside yourself and figure out what is inside you.", "en": " 應該要帶進人物個性的部份 加入真正重要的部份, 我是指好好審視內心找出屬於自己的那一塊"}, {"zh-tw": " Because ultimately, you know, the mystery box is all of us. So there's that. Then the distribution. What's a bigger mystery box than a movie theater? You know? You go to the theater, you're just so excited to see anything.", "en": " 因為最終神祕盒子其實就是我們每一個人 再來是分配. 什麼樣的神祕盒子比電影戲院更大？ 你走進電影院, 期待著看到精采絕倫的戲"}, {"zh-tw": " The moment the lights go down is often the best part, you know? And you're full of that amazing -- that feeling of excited anticipation.

And he came on, he was presenting the video iPod, and what was on the enormous iPod behind him? \"Lost\"! I had no idea! And I realized, holy shit, it'd come full circle.
