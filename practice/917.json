The other children asked me about the movie \"Midnight Express,\" which I had not seen; they inquired how many cigarettes a day I smoked, because they thought all Turks were heavy smokers, and they wondered at what age I would start covering my hair.", "en": " 這也是我第一次 了解什麼是刻板印象 其他小孩會問我有沒有看過 土耳其電影《午夜快車》 他們會問我一天抽多少菸 因為他們覺得土耳其人都是大菸槍 他們也很好奇 我幾歲要開始戴頭巾"}, {"zh-tw": " I came to learn that these were the three main stereotypes about my country: politics, cigarettes and the veil. After Spain, we went to Jordan, Germany and Ankara again.", "en": " 所以我學到 關於土耳其的三種刻板印象 政治、香菸 和面紗 離開西班牙後我們還去過約旦、德國 然後回到安卡拉"}, {"zh-tw": " Everywhere I went, I felt like my imagination was the only suitcase I could take with me.

He was sitting next to a transvestite with a long black wig and mascara running down her cheeks.", "en": " 我看見一個雜貨店老闆 這脾氣暴躁的老人不賣酒 也不跟邊緣人說話 但他當時，坐在一個 戴著長黑髮 睫毛膏哭花在臉上的變裝癖旁邊"}, {"zh-tw": " I watched the man open a pack of cigarettes with trembling hands and offer one to her, and that is the image of the night of the earthquake in my mind today -- a conservative grocer and a crying transvestite smoking together on the sidewalk. In the face of death and destruction, our mundane differences evaporated, and we all became one even if for a few hours.", "en": " 我看著這男人用顫抖的手 拆了包菸 並遞一支給她 那晚地震的那一幕 我始終忘不了 一個保守的雜貨店老闆與哭泣的變裝癖 一同坐在人行道旁抽菸 面對死亡及毀壞 我們最基本的差異消失無蹤 我們成為相同的 即使幾小時也好"}, {"zh-tw": " But I've always believed that stories, too, have a similar effect on us. I'm not saying that fiction has the magnitude of an earthquake, but when we are reading a good novel, we leave our small, cozy apartments behind, go out into the night alone and start getting to know people we had never met before and perhaps had even been biased against.", "en": " 我一直相信故事也有相同作用 我並不是說小說像地震一樣強大 但當我們讀本好書時 我們忘記狹小卻舒適的公寓 像是在夜晚單獨走在街上 認識從未見過的人 甚至是我們先前有所偏見的人"}, {"zh-tw": " Shortly after, I went to a women's college in Boston, then Michigan. I experienced this, not so much as a geographical shift, as a linguistic one.", "en": " 不久後， 我到波士頓及密西根的女子大學就讀 這經驗不是地理上的轉變 而是語言上的"}, {"zh-tw": " I started writing fiction in English. I'm not an immigrant, refugee or exile -- they ask me why I do this -- but the commute between languages gives me the chance to recreate myself.", "en": " 我開始用英文寫小說 我並非移民、難民、或在逃亡 他們問我為什麼 但兩種語言的轉換間 給了我另一個機會，重新創造自己"}, {"zh-tw": " I love writing in Turkish, which to me is very poetic and very emotional, and I love writing in English, which to me is very mathematical and cerebral. So I feel connected to each language in a different way.", "en": " 我愛用土耳其文寫作 對我而言，富有詩意又感性 我也愛用英文寫作 因為它精確又理智 我對這兩種語言的感受是很不同的"}, {"zh-tw": " For me, like millions of other people around the world today, English is an acquired language. When you're a latecomer to a language, what happens is you live there with a continuous and perpetual frustration.", "en": " 對我而言，以及全世界 幾百萬人一樣 英文是第二語言 當你學習新語言的時候 常常會遇到的情況 就是那種 永不停止的挫折感"}, {"zh-tw": " As latecomers, we always want to say more, you know, crack better jokes, say better things, but we end up saying less because there's a gap between the mind and the tongue. And that gap is very intimidating.", "en": " 學習語言，我們總想多說點、 想講好笑的笑話、有趣的事 但說出來的通常不是如此 因為腦子與嘴巴有距離 這種距離是很可怕的"}, {"zh-tw": " But if we manage not to be frightened by it, it's also stimulating. And this is what I discovered in Boston -- that frustration was very stimulating.", "en": " 但是如果我們努力不被它嚇到 它可以是種刺激 這是我在波士頓所發現的 挫折就是刺激"}, {"zh-tw": " At this stage, my grandmother, who had been watching the course of my life with increasing anxiety, started to include in her daily prayers that I urgently get married so that I could settle down once and for all.

Stories accompany me, keeping my pieces and memories together, like an existential glue.", "en": " 我想我有游牧民族因子吧 身體上或精神上都是 故事陪伴著我 像個膠水一樣 將我的記憶黏起來"}, {"zh-tw": " Yet as much as I love stories, recently, I've also begun to think that they lose their magic if and when a story is seen as more than a story.

There's so many Spanish, American, Hispanic characters in it, but there's only one Turkish character and it's a man.\" Now the novel took place on a university campus in Boston, so to me, it was normal that there be more international characters in it than Turkish characters, but I understood what my critic was looking for. And I also understood that I would keep disappointing him.", "en": " 他說：「你書中有一堆」 「西班牙人、美國人、拉丁美洲裔的角色」 「卻只有一個土耳其人，還是個男的。」 因為小說背景是波士頓的一所大學校園 國際學生數量 比土耳其學生多 是很正常的 但我了解評論家要的是什麼 我也了解到 他會一直對我的小說失望"}, {"zh-tw": " He wanted to see the manifestation of my identity. He was looking for a Turkish woman in the book because I happened to be one.", "en": " 他想看的是我身份的呈現 他想在書中讀到土耳其女人角色 因為我是土耳其女人"}, {"zh-tw": " We often talk about how stories change the world, but we should also see how the world of identity politics affects the way stories are being circulated, read and reviewed. Many authors feel this pressure, but non-Western authors feel it more heavily.", "en": " 我們常講到故事如何改變世界 但我們也應該知道世界上的身分政治 是如何影響故事 如何解讀故事 如何看待故事 很多作者皆承受如此壓力 特別是那些非西方作者"}, {"zh-tw": " If you're a woman writer from the Muslim world, like me, then you are expected to write the stories of Muslim women and, preferably, the unhappy stories of unhappy Muslim women. You're expected to write informative, poignant and characteristic stories and leave the experimental and avant-garde to your Western colleagues.", "en": " 如果你像我一樣是伊斯蘭社會的女作家 那大家就期望你寫出 伊斯蘭女人的故事 寫不開心的伊斯蘭女人 背後不開心的故事更好 大家期望你寫 含帶訊息、激烈、人物性格鮮明的故事 其他試驗性的、前衛的故事 就讓其他西方作家來寫就好"}, {"zh-tw": " What I experienced as a child in that school in Madrid is happening in the literary world today. Writers are not seen as creative individuals on their own, but as the representatives of their respective cultures: a few authors from China, a few from Turkey, a few from Nigeria.", "en": " 我小時候在馬德里的經驗 現在的文學社會也發生著 作者不再被視為 單獨富創意的個體 而是他們文化 的代表 一些中國作家、土耳其作家 奈及利亞作家"}, {"zh-tw": " We're all thought to have something very distinctive, if not peculiar.

There's nothing in me that is not in everybody else, and nothing in everybody else that is not in me.\" When identity politics tries to put labels on us, it is our freedom of imagination that is in danger.

We were three writers, one from the Philippines, one Turkish and one Indonesian -- like a joke, you know.", "en": " 我從未忘記我十年前在波士頓哈佛廣場 所參加的多元文化文學讀書會 我們共有三位作家，一個是菲律賓籍 一個土耳其籍，一個印尼籍 像個笑話一樣"}, {"zh-tw": " And the reason why we were brought together was not because we shared an artistic style or a literary taste. It was only because of our passports.", "en": " 但我們相聚的原因 並不是我們作品類似 文學喜好類似 而是因為我們的護照"}, {"zh-tw": " Multicultural writers are expected to tell real stories, not so much the imaginary. A function is attributed to fiction.", "en": " 大家期望多元文化作家寫出真實故事 想像力就不必了 小說被賦予了一個功能"}, {"zh-tw": " In this way, not only the writers themselves, but also their fictional characters become the representatives of something larger. But I must quickly add that this tendency to see a story as more than a story does not solely come from the West.", "en": " 因此，不只是作者本身 連小說中虛構人物 也都代表了更大的東西 我必須補充 這種「故事不只是故事」的想法 不只有在西方世界看得到"}, {"zh-tw": " It comes from everywhere. And I experienced this firsthand when I was put on trial in 2005 for the words my fictional characters uttered in a novel.", "en": " 而是世界各地都如此 我在2005的一次親身經歷 當時我在法庭上受審 原因是我小說中角色所說的一些話"}, {"zh-tw": " I had intended to write a constructive, multi-layered novel about an Armenian and a Turkish family through the eyes of women.
