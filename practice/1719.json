And that leads to the suggestion, maybe economic growth is almost over.", "en": " 只過了 60 年 就能以 80% 的聲速移動 而現在我們沒有更快的交通工具 因為超音速商務飛機 最後失敗了 所以我開始思索 會不會美國經濟最蓬勃發展的年代 已經過去了？ 這也意味著，或許經濟成長 幾乎已經結束了"}, {"zh-tw": " Some of the reasons for this are not really very controversial. There are four headwinds that are just hitting the American economy in the face.", "en": " 有些結束的原因沒有太大的爭議 現在有四大困境正迎面襲擊 美國現在的經濟實力"}, {"zh-tw": " They're demographics, education, debt and inequality. They're powerful enough to cut growth in half.", "en": " 包括人口統計、教育、債務及不平等的問題 這些問題足以減少一半的成長"}, {"zh-tw": " So we need a lot of innovation to offset this decline.
