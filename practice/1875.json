It took me several years, but with the help of an incredibly supportive family, I finally decided life was still worth living."}, {"zh-tw": "我開始對科技深深著迷利用科技幫助行動不便的人請了專門販賣追蹤器的公司Madentec偵測我頭部的小動作，當作滑鼠感應讓我能夠操作電腦", "en": "I became fascinated with using technology to help the severely disabled. Head tracking devices sold commercially by the company Madentec convert my tiny head movementsinto cursor movements, and enable my use of a regular computer."}, {"zh-tw": "我可以上網，可以跟別人寫信定期去破壞好友史蒂夫·卡曾斯的線上文字遊戲。這科技讓我能夠有事做讓我心智活躍讓我覺得自己還存在在這世界上", "en": "I can surf the web, exchange email with people, and routinely destroy my friend Steve Cousins in online word games. This technology allows me to remain engaged, mentally active, and feel like I am a part of the world."}, {"zh-tw": "有一天，我躺在床上看CNN查理·坎普教授讓我驚嘆在喬治亞理工學院的醫療機器人實驗室展示 PR2 機器人我同時寫信給查理，還有Willow Garage 的史蒂夫·卡曾斯我們一起著手開始人道機器人計畫", "en": "One day, I was lying in bed watching CNN, when I was amazed by Professor Charlie Kemp of the Healthcare Robotics Lab at Georgia Tech demonstrating a PR2 robot.

Chad showed me how easy it is to purchase and fly aerial drones."}, {"zh-tw": "我也在這個時候發現，我可以利用飛行器去改善大家的世界透過飛行器幫助長期臥病在床的人讓他們感覺自己能移動、能掌控真的是很讓人振奮利用我的頭當滑鼠感應我可以透過網路介面看見機器人拍到的影像發號命令只要在網路上點個鈕就可以完成", "en": "It was then I realized that I could also use an aerial drone to expand the worlds of bedridden people through flight, giving a sense of movement and control that is incredible. Using a mouse cursor I control with my head, these web interfaces allow me to see video from the robot and send control commands by pressing buttons in a web browser."}, {"zh-tw": "透過練習，我越來越熟悉這個介面我可以在我自己家裡亂晃可以看看我們自己的庭院看看我們種的葡萄", "en": "With a little practice, I becamegood enough with this interface to drive around my home on my own.

One of my challenges as a pilot is to land the drone on our basketball hoop."}, {"zh-tw": "我甚至去更進一步的嘗試頭戴式的顯示器，Oculus Rift特別由 Fighting Walrus 來修改更進一步的深入體驗飛行器的控制自從在 Brown 跟Chad 團隊一起以來我常常在他們的實驗室飛來飛去遠從3000里外一個禮拜好幾次", "en": "I went even further by seeing if I could use a head-mounted display, the Oculus Rift, as modified by Fighting Walrus, to have an immersive experience controlling the drone. With Chad's group at Brown, I regularly fly drones around his lab several times a week,from my home 3,000 miles away."}, {"zh-tw": "只工作、沒娛樂的生活會讓人麻痺所以我們都會找時間玩玩遊戲機器人足球我想不到我還能像現在自己自在的在Brown這樣的校園裡走動", "en": "All work and no fun makes for a dull quadriplegic, so we also find time to play friendly games of robot soccer. I never thought I would be able to casually move around a campus like Brown on my own."}, {"zh-tw": "如果我能付得起學費更好亨利，歡笑之餘我相信在場的所有人都很想看你遙控這台儀器從距離3000哩外的加州遠端遙控", "en": "I just wish I could afford the tuition. Chad Jenkins: Henry, all joking aside, I bet all of these people here would love to see you fly this drone from your bed in California 3,000 miles away."}, {"zh-tw": "OK，亨利，你最近有去過D.C.嗎?來 TEDxMidAtlantic 開心嗎?可以讓我們看看你有多開心嗎?好，來個大總結吧現場展現一下你飛行的技巧吧好吧，看來我們還是有努力的空間但我想這已經足以讓我們看到願景", "en": "Okay, Henry, have you been to D.C. lately? Are you excited to be at TEDxMidAtlantic? Can you show us how excited you are? All right, big finish. Can you show us how good of a pilot you are? All right, we still have a little ways to go with that, but I think it shows the promise."}, {"zh-tw": "亨利的故事之所以動人是因為他讓我們了解他的需求讓我們了解其他跟亨利一樣的人需要什麼樣的科技資源再進一步了解科技能夠提供他們什麼樣的幫助結合兩方的需求創造出一個聰明又有效的方法我們現在想要做的是讓機器人普遍化讓所有的人都能參與其中", "en": "What makes Henry's story amazing is it's about understanding Henry's needs, understanding what people in Henry's situation need from technology, and then also understanding what advanced technology can provide, and then bringing those two things together for use in a wise and responsible way. What we're trying to do is democratize robotics, so that anybody can be a part of this."}, {"zh-tw": "我們已經開始在販售價位合理的機器人如 A.R. 遙控飛機，一台300美金以及Suitable Technologies 的 beam，只要一萬七美金附贈機器人自由軟體讓大家能夠參與我們的計畫我們希望能透過這些工具讓大家一起想如何幫助身體殘缺的人移動如何關懷我們的高齡化社會如何教育我們的下一代去思考能夠創造什麼樣的新工作給未來的中產階級讓我們能監控並且保護我們的環境同時能夠探索宇宙", "en": "We're providing affordable,off-the-shelf robot platforms such as the A.R. drone, 300 dollars, the Suitable Technologies beam,only 17,000 dollars, along with open-source robotics software so that you can be a part of what we're trying to do. And our hope is that, by providing these tools, that you'll be able to think of better ways to provide movement for the disabled, to provide care for our aging population, to help better educate our children, to think about what the new types of middle class jobs could be for the future, to both monitor and protect our environment, and to explore the universe."}, {"zh-tw": "場面還給你，亨利謝謝你，查德", "en": "Back to you, Henry. HE: Thank you, Chad."}, {"zh-tw": "有了這個飛行器，我們便可以看到希望讓長年躺在床上的人能夠再度探索外面的世界機器人會給我們機會公平競爭人類只會受限於自己的心智受限於自己的想像可以讓行動不便的人再次活動別人可以的，他們也可以甚至做得更好這項科技可以提供我們一個行動的管道特別是我們所謂的植物人100年前我會被當作植物人看待", "en": "With this drone setup, we show the potential for bedridden people to once again be able to explore the outside world, and robotics will eventually provide a level playing field where one is only limited by their mental acuity and imagination, where the disabled are able to perform the same activities as everyone else, and perhaps better, and technology will even allow us to provide an outlet for many people who are presently considered vegetables. One hundred years ago, I would have been treated like a vegetable."}, {"zh-tw": "但事實上，他們錯了我會死掉", "en": "Actually, that's not true. I would have died."}, {"zh-tw": "機器人的使用，取決於我們或好或壞是純粹取代人類或是讓我們的生活更好行動不再受限，更能享受生活我們要讓機器人能夠解放大家的心智讓我們能跟世界互動幫助像我一樣的其他人讓世界各地的人受惠", "en": "It is up to us, all of us, to decide how robotics will be used, for good or for evil, for simply replacing people or for making people better, for allowing us to do and enjoy more. Our goal for robotics is tounlock everyone's mental power by making the world more physically accessible to people such as myself and others like me around the globe."}, {"zh-tw": "有你們的幫忙我們可以讓夢想成真謝謝", "en": "With the help of people like you, we can make this dream a reality. Thank you."}], "title": "Henry Evans And Chad Jenkins Meet The Robots For Humanity"}
