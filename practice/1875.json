And our hope is that, by providing these tools, that you'll be able to think of better ways to provide movement for the disabled, to provide care for our aging population, to help better educate our children, to think about what the new types of middle class jobs could be for the future, to both monitor and protect our environment, and to explore the universe.", "en": " 我們已經開始在販售價位合理的機器人 如 A.R. 遙控飛機，一台300美金 以及Suitable Technologies 的 beam，只要一萬七美金 附贈機器人自由軟體 讓大家能夠參與我們的計畫 我們希望能透過這些工具 讓大家一起想 如何幫助身體殘缺的人移動 如何關懷我們的高齡化社會 如何教育我們的下一代 去思考能夠創造什麼樣的新工作 給未來的中產階級 讓我們能監控並且保護我們的環境 同時能夠探索宇宙"}, {"zh-tw": " Back to you, Henry. HE: Thank you, Chad.", "en": " 場面還給你，亨利 謝謝你，查德"}, {"zh-tw": " With this drone setup, we show the potential for bedridden people to once again be able to explore the outside world, and robotics will eventually provide a level playing field where one is only limited by their mental acuity and imagination, where the disabled are able to perform the same activities as everyone else, and perhaps better, and technology will even allow us to provide an outlet for many people who are presently considered vegetables. One hundred years ago, I would have been treated like a vegetable.", "en": " 有了這個飛行器，我們便可以看到希望 讓長年躺在床上的人能夠再度 探索外面的世界 機器人會給我們機會 公平競爭 人類只會受限於自己的心智 受限於自己的想像 可以讓行動不便的人再次活動 別人可以的，他們也可以 甚至做得更好 這項科技可以提供我們 一個行動的管道 特別是我們所謂的植物人 100年前 我會被當作植物人看待"}, {"zh-tw": " Actually, that's not true. I would have died.", "en": " 但事實上，他們錯了 我會死掉"}, {"zh-tw": " It is up to us, all of us, to decide how robotics will be used, for good or for evil, for simply replacing people or for making people better, for allowing us to do and enjoy more. Our goal for robotics is tounlock everyone's mental power by making the world more physically accessible to people such as myself and others like me around the globe.", "en": " 機器人的使用，取決於我們 或好或壞 是純粹取代人類 或是讓我們的生活更好 行動不再受限，更能享受生活 我們要讓機器人能夠解放大家的心智 讓我們能跟世界互動 幫助像我一樣的其他人 讓世界各地的人受惠"}, {"zh-tw": " With the help of people like you, we can make this dream a reality. Thank you.", "en": " 有你們的幫忙 我們可以讓夢想成真 謝謝"}], "title": "Henry Evans And Chad Jenkins Meet The Robots For Humanity"}
