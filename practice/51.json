This was a simple sign error, because it's cheaper to save fuel than to buy fuel, as is well known to companies that do it all the time -- for example, Dupont, SD micro electronics.", "en": " 現在對氣候保護有個新看法 它不僅不花錢，而且還能營利。 這是一個簡單的錯誤癥候 原因就在於，省油比買油要便宜， 眾所周知，很多企業也都一直這樣做。 比如，杜邦、SD微電子。"}, {"zh-tw": " Many other firms -- IBM -- are reducing their energy intensity routinely six percent a year by fixing up their plants, and they get their money back in two or three years. That's called a profit.", "en": " 很多其他公司，像是IBM，正在降低他們的能源密集度， 通過改進他們的工廠，每年一般能減少6%的消耗 兩到三年內就能收回投資。 這就是利潤。"}, {"zh-tw": " Now, similarly, the old story about oil is that if we wanted to save very much of it, it would be expensive, or we would have done it already, because markets are essentially perfect. If, of course, that were true, there would be no innovation, and nobody could make any money.", "en": " 現在，對於石油我們有著同樣的舊思維。如果我們想節約石油 那就要花很多錢，要不我們早就成功了， 因為市場基本完善。 當然，如果這種說法是真的，那這個世界上就不會有創新了， 也沒有人能賺到錢了。"}, {"zh-tw": " But the new story about oil is the government doesn't have to force us to do painful things to get off oil -- not just incrementally, but completely -- quite the contrary. The United States, for example, can completely eliminate its use of oil and rejuvenate the economy at the same time, led by business for profit, because it's so much cheaper to save and substitute for the oil than to keep on buying it. This process will also be catalyzed by the military for its own reasons of combat effectiveness and preventing conflict, particularly over oil.", "en": " 但是，現在對石油有個新看法 政府不用再強迫我們來痛苦地戒掉石油 這裡說的不僅是逐步減少使用，而是徹底地 在全國範圍內停止使用石油。比如說，在美國 能夠做到完全不用石油 還能同時促進經濟發展， 創造商業利潤， 因為比起繼續買石油，節約和尋找替代燃料 要便宜得多。 這一過程同樣需要由軍隊合作加以推動 因為他們有著強大的戰鬥力和預防衝突的能力 尤其是在石油問題上。"}, {"zh-tw": " This thesis is set out in a book called \"Winning the Oil Endgame\" that four colleagues and I wrote and have posted for free at Oilendgame.com -- about 170,000 downloads so far.

We've been spending the last few decades accumulating a very powerful backlog of technologies for saving and substituting for oil, and no one had bothered to add them up before.", "en": " 並且十分有趣的是——感覺有點像現在的石油 我們過去已經花了幾十年的時間 積累了非常強大的技術力量 用於節約石油和探索替代燃料 在以前沒人費心去探討這些問題"}, {"zh-tw": " So when we did, we found some very surprising things. Now, there are two big reasons to be concerned about oil.", "en": " 所以我們研究時，就有了驚人的發現。 如今，石油問題變得越來越顯著，主要原因有兩大方面，"}, {"zh-tw": " Both national competitiveness and national security are at risk.

The point here is, these cars are going to be made super efficient.", "en": " 而之後還會有來自印度的競爭。 關鍵的一點，這些車都會非常省油。"}, {"zh-tw": " The question is, who will make them? Will we in the United States continue to import efficient cars to replace foreign oil, or will we make efficient cars and import neither the oil nor the cars? That seems to make more sense. The more we keep on using the oil, particularly the imported oil, the more we face a very obvious array of problems.", "en": " 問題只是誰來製造它們。 我們美國會不會繼續以進口節能汽車來代替進口石油 或者我們自己製造節能汽車，不再進口石油，也不再進口汽車。 這樣做看起來更有意義 未來我們使用的石油越多，尤其是進口石油 我們所面臨的問題將會越嚴重。"}, {"zh-tw": " Our analysis assumes that they all cost nothing, but nothing is not the right number. It could well be enough to double the oil price, for example.", "en": " 我們在分析中假設它們都沒有什麼成本 並不是說真的沒有成本 比如，這可能足以使汽油的價格上漲一倍"}, {"zh-tw": " And one of the worst of these is what it does to our standing in the world if other countries think that everything we do is about oil, if we have to treat countries that have oil differently than countries that don't have oil.

They have a broad trans-ideological appeal, and because we want them actually to happen, we figured out ways to do them that do not require much, if any, federal legislation, and can, indeed, be done administratively or at a state level.", "en": " 它們能為國庫產生一些淨收益， 不論對哪個意識形態，它都有著廣泛的吸引力。 因為我們希望這一切成為現實 我們已經想好了怎樣去做 我們要求不多，如果有的話，就是聯邦立法。 並能確確實實地落實在行政上或州級政策上。"}, {"zh-tw": " Just to illustrate what to do about the nub of the problem, namely, light vehicles, here are four ultra-light carbon-composite concept cars with low drag, and all but the one at the upper left have hybrid drive. You can sort of have it all with these things.", "en": " 剛才只是說明了核心問題應該怎麼辦， 也就是，製造輕型車輛 這裡有4個超輕型碳複合材料低阻力的概念車， 除了左上角的，都有混合動力驅動 可以說，你可以擁有上面提到的一切"}, {"zh-tw": " For example, this Opel two-seater does 155 miles an hour at 94 miles a gallon. This muscle car from Toyota: 408 horsepower in an ultra-light that does zero to 60 in well under four seconds, and still gets 32 miles a gallon. I'll say more later about this.", "en": " 比如說這個雙座的歐寶車 每小時行駛155英里的話，一加侖油能跑94英里 這個是豐田的超輕型強力車型，408匹馬力 很輕易就能在四秒內從0碼加速到60碼 一加侖油仍然能跑32公里。等一下我再說這個"}, {"zh-tw": " And in the upper left, a pioneering effort 14 years ago by GM -- 84 miles a gallon without even using a hybrid, in a four-seater. Well, saving that fuel, 69 percent of the fuel in light vehicles costs about 57 cents per saved gallon.", "en": " 左上角的這個，是通用汽車14年前的先驅之作 即使在沒有混合動力，四個座椅的情況下，每加侖能跑84英里 那麼，按節省燃料算，輕型汽車能節省69% 每節省一加侖成本大約是57美分"}, {"zh-tw": " But it's even a better deal for heavy trucks, where you save a similar amount at 25 cents a gallon, with better aerodynamics and tires and engines, and so on, and taking out weight so you can put it into payload. So you can double efficiency with a 60 percent internal rate of return.", "en": " 但是，重型卡車的話會更划算 節省的燃料差不多，每加侖只需25美分 還有更先進的空氣動力，輪胎和引擎等。 還解決了重量問題，因此你可以把它算進載重量 所以它的內部收益率為60%，能夠取得雙重效益"}, {"zh-tw": " Then you can go even further, almost tripling efficiency with some operational improvements, double the big haulers' margins. And we intend to use those numbers to create demand pull, and flip the market.", "en": " 然後你可以更進一步，改善經營運作 將效益再提高一倍 大的運輸商利潤能翻一倍 我們打算利用這些數字，拉動需求，扭轉市場趨勢"}, {"zh-tw": " In the airplane business, it's again a similar story where the first 20 percent fuel saving is free, as Boeing is now demonstrating in its new Dreamliner. But then the next generation of planes saves about half.", "en": " 在航空業務方面，情況也是這樣的。 最初的節省的20%的燃料需要投入資金 比如像現在波音公司新的夢幻客機 但是下一代的飛機大約能節省一半。"}, {"zh-tw": " Again, much cheaper than buying the fuel. And if you go over the next 15 years or so to a blended-wing body, kind of a flying wing with internal engines, then you get about a factor three efficiency improvement at comparable or lower cost.", "en": " 同樣，比購買燃料便宜多了 如果你仔細審視一下未來15年，或者是所謂的混合翼結構 就是那種有內置引擎的機翼 那麼你就有可能以相對較低的成本 把你的效益提高三倍"}, {"zh-tw": " Let me focus a minute on the light vehicles, the cars and light trucks, because we all know the most about those; probably everybody here drives one. And yet we may not realize that in a standard sedan, of all the fuel energy you feed into the car, seven-eighths never gets to the wheels; it's lost first in the engine, idling at zero miles a gallon, the power train and accessories.", "en": " 下面我用一分鐘來集中談一下輕型汽車，轎車和輕型卡車。 由於我們對這三種車型比較熟悉 在座的可能都是開著這幾種車來的 然而我們可能沒有意識到，在標準汽車內部 你為車所加的那些油的能量 八分之七都沒用在車輪子上 首先，浪費在引擎內部，還沒起步， 動力系統和配件就費了一加侖油"}, {"zh-tw": " So then of the energy that does get to the wheels, only an eighth of it, half of that, goes to heat the tires on the road, or to heat the air the car pushes aside. And only this little bit, only six percent actually ends up accelerating the car and then heating the brakes when you stop.", "en": " 接著能量才開始驅動車輪 只占總能量的1/8，其中一半還轉化為輪胎摩擦地面的熱量 或者是汽車排放的熱氣 只有這一點點，只有百分之六的能量 在實際上起到了汽車加速的作用 然後在刹車時轉化為熱量"}, {"zh-tw": " In fact, since 95 percent of the weight you're moving is the car not the driver, less than one percent of the fuel energy ends up moving the driver. This is not very gratifying after more than a century of devoted engineering effort.", "en": " 事實上，由於車體的重量占了總重量的95%， 只有不到1%的燃料能量是用在載人上的 但這讓人們不滿意， 因為我們為了改進技術忙了一百多年"}, {"zh-tw": " Moreover, three-fourths of the fuel use is caused by the weight of the car. And it's obvious from the diagram that every unit of energy you save at the wheels is going to avoid wasting another seven units of energy getting that energy to the wheels.", "en": " 此外，四分之三的燃料都耗費在車體重量上 從圖表中明顯可以看出大家省的那一份油都省在車輪上了 接下來我們要把浪費掉的另外七份省出來 都用到車輪子上"}, {"zh-tw": " So there's huge leverage for making the car a lot lighter. And the reason this has not been very seriously examined before is there was a common assumption in the industry that -- well, then it might not be safe if you got whacked by a heavy car, and it would cost a lot more to make, because the only way we know how to make cars much lighter was to use expensive light metals like aluminum and magnesium.", "en": " 因此汽車大幅減重是一個十分重要的方面 而之前沒有認真研究這一點是因為 在這一行有一個不成文的假設-- 就是，如果被重車撞了，車輕了會很不安全， 這樣就需要花費更高的成本 因為我們所知道的，減輕車重的唯一方法 就是使用像鎂、鋁這樣的昂貴輕金屬"}, {"zh-tw": " But these objections are now vanishing through advances in materials. For example, we use a lot of carbon-fiber composites in sporting goods.", "en": " 但隨著材料的進步這些都已經不成問題了 比如，我們使用了大量的碳纖維複合材料 製造體育用品。"}, {"zh-tw": " And it turns out that these are quite remarkable for safety. Here's a handmade McLaren SLR carbon car that got t-boned by a Golf.", "en": " 而事實證明這些都是十分安全的 這裡是手工的邁凱輪單反碳纖維車，擁有高爾夫的T型骨架"}, {"zh-tw": " The Golf was totaled. The McLaren just popped off and scratched the side panel.", "en": " 高爾夫沒玩明白 邁凱輪也出局了，僅僅抓住了其中的一點皮毛。"}, {"zh-tw": " They'll pop it back on and fix the scratch later. But if this McLaren were to run into a wall at 65 miles an hour, the entire crash energy would be absorbed by a couple of woven carbon-fiber composite cones, weighing a total of 15 pounds, hidden in the front end.", "en": " 相信不久，它們會重新進入這一領域，彌補他們的損失。 但是如果邁凱輪的這款車以65英里的時速撞到牆上 碰撞產生的全部能量都會被 一對有碳纖維複合編織而成的錐體所吸收 它重達15磅，隱藏在車體前端"}, {"zh-tw": " Because these materials could actually absorb six to 12 times as much energy per pound as steel, and do so a lot more smoothly. And this means we've just cracked the conundrum of safety and weight.", "en": " 因為在現實中每磅這樣的材料吸收的 能量，比同重量的鋼鐵要高出5到11倍 而且要平穩順利的多 這意味著我們剛剛破獲了安全和重量的難題。"}, {"zh-tw": " We could make cars bigger, which is protective, but make them light. Whereas if we made them heavy, they'd be both hostile and inefficient.", "en": " 我們可以把汽車造的更大，更安全，但要減輕重量 如果我們把車造的很沉，只會礙手礙腳，效率降低。"}, {"zh-tw": " And when you make them light in the right way, that can be simpler and cheaper to make. You can end up saving money, and lives, and oil, all at the same time.", "en": " 如果我們用正確的方式來減輕車重 汽車製造將會變得更簡單，成本更低。 同時，你不用再為省錢省油省時間煩惱了"}, {"zh-tw": " I showed here two years ago a little bit about a design of your basic, uncompromised, quintupled-efficiency suburban-assault vehicle -- -- and this is a complete virtual design that is production-costed manufacturable. And the process needed to make it is actually coming toward the market quite nicely.", "en": " 兩年前我就多多少少提到過 一款你必不可少，不折不扣的， 五倍車速郊區突擊車。 而且這是一個全新的視覺設計 屬於生產製造成本。 而且製造過程 正在逐漸與市場很好地結合起來。"}, {"zh-tw": " We figured out a kind of a digital inkjet printer for this very stiff, strong, carbon-composite material, and then ways to thermoform it, because it's a combination of carbon and nylon, into whatever complex shapes you want, like the one just shown at the auto show by one of the tier-one suppliers. And the manufacturing you can do this way gets radically simplified.", "en": " 我們設計出一種電子噴墨印表機 專門配合這種非常堅固的，高強度的碳複合材料， 然後再把它們加熱， 因為它是碳和尼龍的結合物， 因此你可以把它做成各種你想要的複雜形狀， 不久前一個前端供應商在車展上展示的就是其中一例。 通過這種方式，你可以從根本上使製造方式簡單化。"}, {"zh-tw": " Because the auto body has only, say, 14 parts, instead of 100, 150. Each one is formed by one fairly cheap die set, instead of four expensive ones for stamping steel.", "en": " 因為這樣的車身僅需14個部分，而不再是100150個零件 每一部分都由一套相當便宜的成套模具組成， 而不是四個昂貴的衝壓鋼。"}, {"zh-tw": " Each of the parts can be easily lifted with no hoist. They snap together like a kid's toy.", "en": " 不用起重機就能很容易地吊起來每一部分。 它們扣合在一起就像小孩疊積木一樣"}, {"zh-tw": " So you got rid of the body shop. And if you want, you can lay color in the mold, and get rid of the paint shop.", "en": " 你就再也不用去汽車修理廠了 如果你願意，你可以在模具裡直接加顏色，就省的給車噴漆了"}, {"zh-tw": " Those are the two hardest and costliest parts of making a car. So you end up with at least two-fifths lower capital intensity than the leanest plant in the industry, which GM has in Lansing.", "en": " 這兩個是汽車製造中最麻煩也是最貴的部分。 因此最後你將會比汽車行業中最精小的工廠， 通用設在 Lansing 的分廠，還要節省2/5的資金"}, {"zh-tw": " The plant also gets smaller. Now, when you go through a similar analysis for every way we use oil, including buildings, industry, feedstocks and so on, you find that of the 28 million barrels a day the government says we will need in 2025, well, about eight of that can be removed by efficiency by then, with another seven still being saved as the vehicle stocks turn over, at an average cost of only 12 bucks a barrel, instead of 26 for buying the oil.", "en": " 工廠規模也會更小。 現在，如果你查閱一份類似分析石油使用方式的報告的話， 這裡面包括建築、工業、原料等， 你會發現我們每天要消耗2800萬桶， 這是政府預測得到2025年時的資料， 那麼，通過提高使用效率，到時候我們每桶可節約8美元， 隨著汽車股的逆轉，還可以省掉另外7美元 平均下來每桶油只需12美元 而不是之前預言的26美元"}, {"zh-tw": " And then another six can be made robustly, competitively, from cellulosic ethanol and a little bio-diesel, without interfering at all with the water or land needs of crop production. There is a huge amount of gas to be saved, about half the projected gas at about an eighth of its price.", "en": " 接著，汽油中的一半可以用有強勁競爭力的 纖維素乙醇和少量的生物柴油來代替， 它們是用水和糧食造的，絕對沒有問題。 這樣能省下大量的汽油 計畫中大約一半的石油價格只有其原價格的1/8"}, {"zh-tw": " And here are some no-brainer substitutions of it, with lots left over. So much, in fact, that after you've handled the domestic oil forecast from areas already approved, you have only this little bit left, and let's see how we can meet that, because there's a pretty flexible menu of ways.", "en": " 還有其他一些簡單易行的代替方法，給我們很多選擇餘地。 說了這麼多，事實上，你已經把握住了公認的領域 國內石油的走勢 只剩下這點，先看看我們應該怎樣解決 因為方法靈活多變，選擇性大。"}, {"zh-tw": " We could, of course, buy more efficiency. Maybe you ought to buy efficiency at 26 bucks instead of 12.", "en": " 我們當然可以，少花錢買到更多的燃料 也許你花12美元買的燃料原本值26美元"}, {"zh-tw": " Or wait to capture the second half of it.
