In one, I used NASA supercomputers to design next-generation spacecraft, and in the other I was a data scientist looking for potential smugglers of sensitive nuclear technologies.", "en": " 我五年前還是個博士生 過著兩種生活 一個是用美國太空總署的超級電腦 設計下一代的太空船 另一個身分則是數據科學家 找出誰有可能走私 性能高的核能科技"}, {"zh-tw": " As a data scientist, I did a lot of analyses, mostly of facilities, industrial facilities around the world. And I was always looking for a better canvas to tie these all together.", "en": " 那作為一個數據科學家 我做了不少的數據分析在設備方面 像世界各地的工業設備 我總是在尋找更好的畫面 把落在各地的工業設備拍在一起"}, {"zh-tw": " And one day, I was thinking about how all data has a location, and I realized that the answer had been staring me in the face. Although I was a satellite engineer, I hadn't thought about using satellite imagery in my work.", "en": " 有天突然靈機一動 想到全部的數據不都有存放的地方 瞬間發現 答案早就在眼前了 雖然我是衛星工程師 卻從未想在工作中 使用衛星成像"}, {"zh-tw": " Now, like most of us, I'd been online, I'd see my house, so I thought, I'll hop in there and I'll start looking up some of these facilities. And what I found really surprised me.", "en": " 你們大都知道我常在線上 我看得到我家，所以我就想 我可以跳入這個領域，然後開始尋找 這類的設備 我對搜尋的結果感到訝異"}, {"zh-tw": " The pictures that I was finding were years out of date, and because of that, it had relatively little relevance to the work that I was doing today. But I was intrigued.", "en": " 我所找到的圖片 已經遠遠過時了 也因為這樣 過時的圖對我 現今的工作毫無關聯 卻引起我的好奇心"}, {"zh-tw": " I mean, satellite imagery is pretty amazing stuff. There are millions and millions of sensors surrounding us today, but there's still so much wedon't know on a daily basis.", "en": " 用衛星拍出圖像是很酷的事 今天有好幾百萬的感應器 充斥在你我的周遭 我們卻對每日的變動一無所知"}, {"zh-tw": " How much oil is stored in all of China? How much corn is being produced? How many ships are in all of our world's ports? Now, in theory, all of these questions could be answered by imagery, but not if it's old. And if this data was so valuable, then how come I couldn't get my hands on more recent pictures? So the story begins over 50 years ago with the launch of the first generation of U.S. government photo reconnaissance satellites.", "en": " 像中國蘊藏多少油? 有多少穀物生產? 今日全球有多少船駐入港口? 理論上來講，這些問題 可以看圖像回答 但若用過時的可就難了 倘若這數據很珍貴 我怎會沒法子 取得更多得近照呢? 所以要從 50 年前講起 當美國政府發射出第一代 衛星拍攝照片以利勘察"}, {"zh-tw": " And today, there's a handful of the great, great grandchildren of these early Cold War machines which are now operated by private companies and from which the vast majority of satellite imagery that you and I see on a daily basis comes. During this period, launching things into space, just the rocket to get the satellite up there, has cost hundreds of millions of dollars each, and that's created tremendous pressure to launch things infrequently and to make sure that when you do, you cram as much functionality in there as possible.", "en": " 今日 到處可見這些 早期冷戰留下來的機器 現在都由私營企業經營 也就是你我看到每日 由衛星拍出的圖像 在這期間，射東西到外太空 像用火箭射出衛星到外太空 每射出一次就要花好幾億 壓力大到喘不過氣來 所以久久才會射到外太空 而且還要確保射時 要盡一切塞進一堆功能"}, {"zh-tw": " All of this has only made satellites bigger and bigger and bigger and more expensive, now nearly a billion, with a b, dollars per copy. Because they are so expensive, there aren't very many of them.", "en": " 這只讓衛星 變得越來越來越大 越來越貴 現在都要十億美元了，每份都是億開頭的 正因為它們超級貴 所以數量不多"}, {"zh-tw": " Because there aren't very many of them, the pictures that we see on a daily basis tend to be old. I think a lot of people actuallyunderstand this anecdotally, but in order to visualize just how sparsely our planet is collected, some friends and I put together a dataset of the 30 million pictures that have been gathered by these satellites between 2000 and 2010.", "en": " 也因為數量不多 平常看到的照片 都早就過時以久了 我想大家都聽得懂我再講什麼 但為了能用想像得出 地球的照片真是少得可憐 我與朋友就開始集中數據 集到三千萬張的照片 都是在 2000-2010 年的衛星拍的"}, {"zh-tw": " As you can see in blue, huge areas of our world are barely seen, less than once a year, and even the areas that are seen most frequently, those in red, are seen at best once a quarter. Now as aerospace engineering grad students, this chart cried out to us as a challenge.", "en": " 那一大片藍色代表地球罕見的地方 甚至一年也沒見過一次 就算是最常看見的地方 紅色代表至少一季見過一次 身為航空航天工程學的研究生 這圖表簡直觸動我每一根神經"}, {"zh-tw": " Why do these things have to be so expensive? Does a single satellite really have to cost the equivalent of three 747 jumbo jets? Wasn't there a way to build a smaller, simpler, new satellite design that could enable more timely imaging? I realize that it does sound a little bit crazy that we were going to go out and just begin designing satellites, but fortunately we had help. In the late 1990s, a couple of professors proposed a concept for radically reducing the price of putting things in space.", "en": " 有必要那麼貴嗎? 一顆衛星真得有必要貴到 約 3 台波音 747 飛機合起來的價格嗎? 難道就沒有方法建造 更小、更簡單、更新穎的設計 更有效率的拍出圖像嗎? 我知道這聽來像瘋了 但我們決定要到外面亂闖 只為了重新設計衛星 好在我們有貴人 在 1990 年末 有幾位教授打膽提出 讓衛星射到外大空更便宜的方案"}, {"zh-tw": " This was hitchhiking small satellites alongside much larger satellites. This dropped the cost of putting objects up there by over a factor of 100, and suddenly we could afford to experiment, to take a little bit of risk, and to realize a lot of innovation.", "en": " 這些小衛星 都是隨著較大的射出 這大幅降低成本 超過 100 倍 突然間，研究變成負擔得起了 冒一點風險 就可成就更多的創新"}, {"zh-tw": " And a new generation of engineers and scientists, mostly out of universities, began launching these very small, breadbox-sized satellites called CubeSats. And these were built with electronics obtained from RadioShack instead of Lockheed Martin.", "en": " 新一代的工程師和科學家 大多大學畢業 就開始射出小的 像土司箱的人工衛星叫作CubeSats 這些電子器件都取自無線電屋公司 不是洛克西德公司的"}, {"zh-tw": " Now it was using the lessonslearned from these early missions that my friends and I began a series of sketches of our own satellite design. And I can't remember a specific day where we made a conscious decision that we were actually going togo out and build these things, but once we got that idea in our minds of the world as a dataset, of being able to capture millions of data points on a daily basis describing the global economy, of being able to unearth billions of connections between them that had never before been found, it just seemed boring to go work on anything else.", "en": " 接下來就是跟前人取經 朋友跟我開始畫出 一系列有關衛星的草圖 記不得是哪一天 不知是哪根蔥促使我們 決心將這些草圖變成實體 一旦那慾望跑進我們的腦海裡 要將世界變成數據 要能夠捕捉好幾百萬的數據點 日日都能收到相關全球經濟的資料 能夠接收到幾十億地球外的資訊 而且是前所未聞的 這麼一想 要去做別的事情就沒勁了"}, {"zh-tw": " And so we moved into a cramped, windowless office in Palo Alto, and began working to take our design from the drawing board into the lab. The first major question we had to tackle was just how big to build this thing.", "en": " 所以我們就搬到帕羅奧圖城市 又窄小又沒窗戶的辦公室 開始將草圖上的設計 搬進實驗室做出實體 我們遇到第一大的問題 就是要建造的有多大"}, {"zh-tw": " In space, size drives cost, and we had worked with these very small, breadbox-sized satellites in school, but as we began to betterunderstand the laws of physics, we found that the quality of pictures those satellites could take was very limited, because the laws of physics dictate that the best picture youcan take through a telescope is a function of the diameter of that telescope, and these satellites had a very small, very constrained volume. And we found that the best picture we would have been able to get looked something like this.", "en": " 在外太空，尺寸越大價格越貴 而我們在學校裡 有做過像土司箱大小的衛星 隨著對物理定律的了解加深 發現由衛星拍出 圖像的品質很有限 因為物理定律名確指出 要能拍出質感好的圖像 跟望眼鏡的直徑有關 但這些衛星都非常小 容量也有限 我們發現拍出最棒的 圖像卻長這樣子"}, {"zh-tw": " Although this was the low-cost option, quite frankly it was just too blurry to see the things that makesatellite imagery valuable. So about three or four weeks later, we met a group of engineers randomly who had worked on the first private imaging satellite ever developed, and they told us that back in the 1970s, the U.S. government had found a powerful optimal tradeoff -- that in taking pictures at rightabout one meter resolution, being able to see objects one meter in size, they had found that they could notjust get very high-quality images, but get a lot of them at an affordable price.", "en": " 雖然成本低 但真得太模糊了 這樣子衛星的優點都沒發揮出來 所以約 3-4 個星期後 偶遇一個團隊的工程師 衛星首次傳送圖像 就是他們打造的 他們說 1970 年時 美國政府有找到強而有力的方式 拍出清晰圖像 拍照時用 100 公分的解析度 就能以同樣的尺寸拍到物體 他們發現怎樣就是拍不出解析度高的圖像 所以用能負擔的價格多拍幾張"}, {"zh-tw": " From our own computer simulations, we quickly found that one meter really was the minimum viable product to be able to see the drivers of our global economy, for the first time, being able to count the ships and cars and shippingcontainers and trucks that move around our world on a daily basis, while conveniently still notbeing able to see individuals. We had found our compromise.", "en": " 我們用電腦模擬 迅速發現 100 公分 小物體是可行的 能夠見到全球經濟的驅動 第一次我們能夠算出 有多少船、車輛、運輸、貨櫃、卡車 每天在全球運作 雖然還不能夠很簡單的看清楚人 我們也找到妥協的方法"}, {"zh-tw": " We would have to build something larger than the original breadbox, now more like a mini-fridge, but we still wouldn't have to build a pickup truck. So now we had our constraint.", "en": " 我們需要建造比原形 吐司箱大小更大的東西 看起來像個迷你冰箱 還不到建造小貨車尺寸的地步 現在出現另一個限制"}, {"zh-tw": " The laws of physics dictated the absolute minimum-sizedtelescope that we could build. What came next was making the rest of the satellite as small and as simple as possible, basically a flying telescope with four walls and a set of electronics smaller than a phone book that used less power than a 100 watt lightbulb.", "en": " 物理定律指出 我們能建造出最小的望眼鏡尺寸 接下來的任務就是打造出 越小越簡單的衛星越好 基本上就是一個會飛的四面望眼鏡 有著一組電子器材比一本電話簿還小 用量低於100瓦燈泡"}, {"zh-tw": " The big challenge became actually taking the pictures through that telescope. Traditional imaging satellites use a line scanner, similar to a Xerox machine, and as they traverse the Earth, they take pictures, scanning row by row by row to build the complete image.", "en": " 挑戰接著變成 能否順利拍下圖像? 傳統衛星拍的圖像都用線掃描器 就像一台影印機一樣 然後它們就會橫越地球拍照 每行每行的掃描 以便建立完整的圖像"}, {"zh-tw": " Now people use these because they get a lot of light, which means less of the noise you see in a low-cost cell phone image. The problem with them is they require very sophisticated pointing.", "en": " 現在人們都能用因為他們亮多了 這意味著畫質清晰多了 不像用廉價的手機拍照一樣的粗糙 然而，又有問題出現了 它們需要很精緻的數據點"}, {"zh-tw": " You have to stay focused on a 50-centimeter target from over 600 miles away while moving at more thanseven kilometers a second, which requires an awesome degree of complexity. So instead, we turned to a newgeneration of video sensors, originally created for use in night vision goggles.", "en": " 每秒能夠橫越超過七公里 就能擁有很棒的解析度 但離物體遠超過 600 英呎的地方 卻只能聚焦物體的 50 公分 所以我們轉向新一代的錄影感應器 原本是要用於夜視眼鏡"}, {"zh-tw": " Instead of taking a single, high quality image, we could take a videostream of individually noisier frames, but then we could recombine all of those frames together into very high-quality images using sophisticated pixel processing techniques here on the ground, at a cost of one one hundredth a traditional system. And we applied this technique to many of the other systems on the satellite as well, and day by day, our design evolved from CAD to prototypes to production units.", "en": " 與其一次拍下高值圖像 我們就用視訊流拍下 一張張粗糙的圖像 然後幫它們 結成一體 成為高質圖像 使用的是精密的機器處理畫素 就在這地上 是原來成本的百分之一 我們也使用這科技 在別的衛星系統上 我們的設計每篇都會做更換 從電腦輔助設計軟體、原型 到生產線"}, {"zh-tw": " A few short weeks ago, we packed up SkySat 1, put our signatures on it, and waved goodbye for the last time on Earth. Today, it's sitting in its final launch configuration ready to blast off in a few short weeks.", "en": " 幾星期前 我們製的衛星 SkySat 一號準備好了 簽上我們的名字後 就等著與地球拜拜 今日它仍在它當初射出的位置 準備在幾星期後射出"}, {"zh-tw": " And soon, we'll turn our attention to launching a constellation of 24 or more of these satellites and beginning to build the scalable analytics that will allow us to unearth the insights in the petabytes of data we will collect. So why do all of this? Why build these satellites? Well, it turns out imaging satellites have a unique ability to provide global transparency, and providing that transparency on a timely basis is simply an idea whose time has come.", "en": " 很快的，我們的注意力轉到發射 一群 24 台或更多的衛星 開始提供數據分析 讓我們看到地球外的視野 用拍位元組收集而成 用意是什麼? 為何要製造這些衛星? 因為用衛星傳送圖像 才有辦法提供國際的透明度 為此透明度提供有效的時間單位 就是靈感的來源"}, {"zh-tw": " We see ourselves as pioneers of a new frontier, and beyond economic data, unlocking the human story, moment by moment. For a data scientist that just happened to go to space camp as a kid, it just doesn't get much better than that.", "en": " 我們是自己為新領域的先驅 經濟數據也時時刻刻 為人類提供圖像 作為數據科學家 感覺就像是個小孩去了一趟外太空野營 沒有什麼比這感到更棒了"}, {"zh-tw": " Thank you.", "en": " 謝謝"}], "title": "Dan Berkenstock The World Is One Big Dataset Now How To Photograph It"}
