Hitler had two of them, and he didn't have any.", "en": " 而當中他最想擁有的是維梅爾(Vermeer)的作品 希特勒收藏了其中兩幅，而他一幅也沒有"}, {"zh-tw": " So he finally found an art dealer, a Dutch art dealer named Han van Meegeren, who sold him a wonderful Vermeer for the cost of what would now be 10 million dollars.

I'm a psychologists -- why do origins matter so much? Why do we respond so much to our knowledge of where something comes from? Well there's an answer that many people would give.

In front of them on a screen is information about the wine.", "en": " 他們讓人躺進dMRI掃描儀 當人躺在那裡，通過一根管子 他們可以喝酒 而在他們面前的螢幕則會顯示關於他們喝的酒的資訊"}, {"zh-tw": " Everybody, of course, drinks exactly the same wine.

Or take sex.", "en": " 這不只是你說你比較快樂，或你比較喜歡 而是你用不同的方式在感受這件事 就性別來說"}, {"zh-tw": " These are stimuli I've used in some of my studies. And if you simply show people these pictures, they'll say these are fairly attractive people.", "en": " 這是我曾用在某些研究裡的刺激方式 如果單純讓人們看這些照片 他們會說這些人相當地有魅力"}, {"zh-tw": " But how attractive you find them, how sexually or romantically moved you are by them, rests critically on who you think you're looking at. You probably think the picture on the left is male, the one on the right is female.", "en": " 但你認為他們多有魅力 多性感，多麼令你覺得浪漫 關鍵在於你覺得你正在看誰 你也許認為左邊這張圖是男性 右邊這張圖是女性"}, {"zh-tw": " If that belief turns out to be mistaken, it will make a difference.

If you like somebody, they look better to you.", "en": " 也許其中最令人振奮的發現是 心理學上的快樂 是你看起來比外表更好看 如果你喜歡某人，你看他們就會覺得比較好看"}, {"zh-tw": " This is why spouses in happy marriages tend to think that their husband or wife looks much better than anyone else thinks that they do. A particularly dramatic example of this comes from a neurological disorder known as Capgras syndrome.", "en": " 這就為何在幸福的婚姻裡 配偶們都會認為他們的另一半 遠比別人認為的還要好看許多 一個特別典型的例子 是神經系統疾病，稱做卡波格拉斯症候群"}, {"zh-tw": " So Capgras syndrome is a disorder where you get a specific delusion. Sufferers of Capgras syndrome believe that the people they love most in the world have been replaced by perfect duplicates.", "en": " 卡波格拉斯症候群是一種精神疾病 讓人有特定的幻覺 卡波格拉斯症候群的病人 相信這世界上他們最愛的人 被人給完美的冒充了"}, {"zh-tw": " Now often, a result of Capgras syndrome is tragic.

This was recorded in 1931.", "en": " 但至少有一個病例 一位卡波格拉斯症候的病人有了美滿的結局 這是1931年的一個紀錄"}, {"zh-tw": " \"Research described a woman with Capgras syndrome who complained about her poorly endowed and sexually inadequate lover.\" But that was before she got Capgras syndrome.

So one reason why you might like something is its utility.", "en": " 第三個例子 談談消費產品 你喜歡東西的其中一個原因可能是其功用"}, {"zh-tw": " You can put shoes on your feet; you can play golf with golf clubs; and chewed up bubble gum doesn't do anything at all for you.

So one answer was George Clooney.", "en": " 所以在我們某一個實驗裡 我們請人們說出他們喜歡的名人 一位他們崇拜的還在世的人 其中有人回答喬治克隆尼"}, {"zh-tw": " Then we asked them, \"How much would you pay for George Clooney's sweater?\" And the answer is a fair amount -- more than you would pay for a brand new sweater or a sweater owned by somebody who you didn't adore. Then we asked other groups of subjects -- we gave them different restrictions and different conditions.", "en": " 然後我們問他們 「你願意花多少錢買喬治克隆尼的毛衣？」 答案是一筆相當多的金額 -- 比起買一件全新的毛衣還要多 也比你不崇拜的人所擁有的毛衣還多 然後我們問了其他的主題 我們給了他們不同的限制 還有不同的條件"}, {"zh-tw": " So for instance, we told some people, \"Look, you can buy the sweater, but you can't tell anybody you own it, and you can't resell it.\" That drops the value of it, suggesting that that's one reason why we like it. But what really causes an effect is you tell people, \"Look, you could resell it, you could boast about it, but before it gets to you, it's thoroughly washed.\" That causes a huge drop in the value.", "en": " 例如，我們告訴某些人 「聽好，你能買那件毛衣 但你不能告訴任何人你擁有那件毛衣 然後你也不能把毛衣再拍賣出去。」 該件毛衣的價值下跌了 這說明了我們喜歡這件毛衣的其中一個原因 但真正造成影響的是 你告訴人們：「看，你可以再把毛衣賣出去，你可以吹捧毛衣的價值 但在你得到毛衣之前 這毛衣已經完全洗乾淨了。」 這點造成毛衣的價值大跌"}, {"zh-tw": " As my wife put it, \"You've washed away the Clooney cooties.\" So let's go back to art. I would love a Chagall. I love the work of Chagall.", "en": " 如同我太太說的：「你已經把克隆尼的味道洗掉了。」 我們回來談藝術 我喜歡夏卡爾，我喜歡夏卡爾的作品"}, {"zh-tw": " If people want to get me something at the end of the conference, you could buy me a Chagall.

Rather, it's because I want something that has a specific history.", "en": " 這不是因為，不是單純因為， 我是一個勢力的人，想吹噓自己擁有一幅真跡 而是因為我想要擁有一件帶有特殊意義的東西"}, {"zh-tw": " In the case of artwork, the history is special indeed. The philosopher Denis Dutton in his wonderful book \"The Art Instinct\" makes the case that, \"The value of an artwork is rooted in assumptions about the human performance underlying its creation.\" And that could explain the difference between an original and a forgery.", "en": " 這些藝術作品 他們的歷史背景是非常特別的 哲學家Denis Dutton 在他精彩的著作《The Art Instinct》 說明了「藝術作品的價值 存在於人類行為中創造力的假設。」 這點足以解釋 真跡和仿畫的不同"}, {"zh-tw": " They may look alike, but they have a different history.

This is a work by Jackson Pollock.", "en": " 這個理論可以解釋 人們在藝術品味上的差別 這是Jackson Pollock的作品"}, {"zh-tw": " Who here likes the work of Jackson Pollock? Okay. Who here, it does nothing for them? They just don't like it. I'm not going to make a claim about who's right, but I will make an empirical claim about people's intuitions, which is that, if you like the work of Jackson Pollock, you'll tend more so than the people who don't like it to believe that these works are difficult to create, that they require a lot of time and energy and creative energy.", "en": " 在座有誰喜歡Jackson Pollock的作品的呢？ 好，那在座有人對這作品一點都不感興趣的呢？ 他們不喜歡這件作品 我不會說明到底哪一方是對的 但我會做一項關於 人類意念的實證說明 也就是說，如果你喜歡Jackson Pollock的作品 你會比那些不喜歡他作品的人 更願意去相信這些作品是很困難才完成的 這需要花上很多的時間和體力 還有創造力"}, {"zh-tw": " I use Jackson Pollock on purpose as an example because there's a young American artist who paints very much in the style of Jackson Pollock, and her work was worth many tens of thousands of dollars -- in large part because she's a very young artist.
