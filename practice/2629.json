Now, the experiencethat gave rise to intersectionality was my chance encounterwith a woman named Emma DeGraffenreid.", "en": " 許多年前，我開始用「交叉性」這個名詞 來指代這樣的問題：有關社會正義的問題 如種族和性別歧視的問題 其內在往往是交叉重疊的。 並且產生了多重的不公現象。 提出【交叉性】的緣由， 是我正好遇到了一位叫艾瑪.蒂格拉福瑞的女人。"}, {"zh-tw": " Emma DeGraffenreidwas an African-American woman, a working wife and a mother. I actually read about Emma's storyfrom the pages of a legal opinion written by a judgewho had dismissed Emma's claim of race and gender discrimination against a local car manufacturing plant.", "en": " 艾瑪.蒂格拉福瑞是一位非裔美国女性， 她是一位有工作的妻子兼母親 事實上，我實在法律意見書上讀到她的名字的， 那是由一位駁回了艾瑪 對於種族和性別歧視的訴訟的法官所寫的。 這樁訴訟的被告是一個汽車製造廠。"}, {"zh-tw": " Emma, like so many African-American women, sought better employmentfor her family and for others. She wanted to create a better lifefor her children and for her family.", "en": " 艾瑪，就如同許多非裔的美國婦女一樣， 嘗試為她的家人和其他人尋求更好的就業機會。 她希望為她的孩子和家庭創造一個更好的生活。"}, {"zh-tw": " But she applied for a job, and she was not hired, and she believed that she was not hiredbecause she was a black woman. Now, the judge in questiondismissed Emma's suit, and the argumentfor dismissing the suit was that the employerdid hire African-Americans and the employer hired women.", "en": " 但是她應徵了一個工作， 卻沒有被雇用。 她相信她沒有被雇用的原因是因為她是一位黑人婦女。 這位法官駁回了艾瑪的訴訟， 而他駁回這個訴訟的理由是 那個雇主有雇用非裔美國人， 也有雇用婦女。"}, {"zh-tw": " The real problem, though, that the judgewas not willing to acknowledge was what Emma was actually trying to say, that the African-Americansthat were hired, usually for industrial jobs,maintenance jobs, were all men. And the women that were hired, usually for secretarialor front-office work, were all white.", "en": " 雖然這位法官不願意承認，但問題的實質 正是艾瑪實際上所要說的事： 那些僱用非裔美國人的職位， 通常是工業性、維修的工作，所僱用的都是男性。 而雇用了女性的職位， 通常是秘書性或服務台的工作， 所僱用的都是白人女性。"}, {"zh-tw": " Only if the court was able to seehow these policies came together would he be able to seethe double discrimination that Emma DeGraffenreid was facing. But the court refused to allow Emmato put two causes of action together to tell her story because he believed that,by allowing her to do that, she would be ableto have preferential treatment.", "en": " 只有當那位法官將這兩個問題放在一起看時， 他才能夠看到艾瑪所面對的 雙重歧視。 但是那位法官拒絕讓艾瑪將這兩件事的前因後果放在一起 來敘述她的故事。 因為他相信，如果他讓她如此做， 她會得到優惠待遇。"}, {"zh-tw": " She would have an advantageby having two swings at the bat, when African-American men and white womenonly had one swing at the bat. But of course, neitherAfrican-American men or white women needed to combine a raceand gender discrimination claim to tell the story of the discriminationthey were experiencing.", "en": " 她會有雙重的優勢， 而非裔男性和白人婦女只有一層優勢。 但是，當然，無論是非裔男性及白人婦女 都無需將種族和性別歧視結合在一起 來向大家講述他們所經歷的歧視。"}, {"zh-tw": " Why wasn't the real unfairness law's refusal to protectAfrican-American women simply because their experiencesweren't exactly the same as white women and African-American men? Rather than broadening the frameto include African-American women, the court simply tossed their casecompletely out of court. Now, as a studentof antidiscrimination law, as a feminist, as an antiracist, I was struck by this case.", "en": " 為什麼這不被當成是歧視 當法律拒絕保護非裔女性這一群體 只是因為她們受歧視的經歷與非裔男性或白人女性並非一模一樣 難道這不是真正的不公？ 他們採取的不是拓寬認知框架來把非裔美國婦女囊括進去， 而是將她們的案子完全拒于法庭門外。 現在，作為一名學習反歧視法律的學生， 作為一位女性主義者， 作為一位反種族歧視者， 我被這個案子大大撼動。"}, {"zh-tw": " It felt to me like injustice squared. So first of all, black women weren't allowedto work at the plant.", "en": " 我感覺這就像是成倍的不公正。 首先， 黑人婦女不被允許在工廠工作。"}, {"zh-tw": " Second of all, the courtdoubled down on this exclusion by making it legally inconsequential. And to boot, there wasno name for this problem.", "en": " 第二，法院通過大大降低其在法律中的重要性 加強了這種排擠。 除此之外,這個問題並沒有一個屬於自己的名字。"}, {"zh-tw": " And we all know that,where there's no name for a problem, you can't see a problem, and when you can't see a problem,you pretty much can't solve it. Many years later, I had come to recognize that the problem that Emma was facingwas a framing problem.", "en": " 我們都知道，當一個問題沒有名字時， 你就看不到問題， 然後當你看不到有問題時，你當然就無法解決那個問題。 許多年後，我漸漸認識到 艾瑪所面對的問題是一個認知框架的問題。"}, {"zh-tw": " The frame that the court was using to see gender discriminationor to see race discrimination was partial, and it was distorting. For me, the challenge that I faced was trying to figure out whetherthere was an alternative narrative, a prism that would allow usto see Emma's dilemma, a prism that would allow usto rescue her from the cracks in the law, that would allow judges to see her story.", "en": " 法院採用看待性別歧視 或者種族歧視的框架來看待這個問題， 是片面的，是扭曲的。 對我而言，我所面對的挑戰是 我能否試著找出一個能指代這一問題的敘述， 一個可以讓我們看到艾瑪的困境的視角， 一個可以讓我們得以將她從法律漏洞里拯救出來的視角， 以期使法官們看到她的故事。"}, {"zh-tw": " So it occurred to me, maybe a simple analogy to an intersection might allow judgesto better see Emma's dilemma. So if we think about this intersection,the roads to the intersection would be the way that the workforcewas structured by race and by gender.", "en": " 我突然想到， 或許一個簡單的交叉點的類比 或許可以讓法官們更好的意識到艾瑪的困境。 所以如果我們仔細想想這個交叉點，那麼匯集與這個交叉點的路就是 由各個種族和性別所組成的勞動力構成的。"}, {"zh-tw": " And then the traffic in those roadswould be the hiring policies and the other practicesthat ran through those roads. Now, because Emmawas both black and female, she was positioned preciselywhere those roads overlapped, experiencing the simultaneous impact of the company's gender and race traffic.", "en": " 路上的交通工具就是僱傭政策 以及穿行在這些道路上的其他嘗試。 現在，因為艾瑪既是黑人又是女性， 她的位置正好在 位於兩條路的交叉點， 因此同時遭受到 公司的性別和種族的碰撞。"}, {"zh-tw": " The law -- the law islike that ambulance that shows up and is ready to treat Emmaonly if it can be shown that she was harmedon the race road or on the gender road but not where those roads intersected. So what do you callbeing impacted by multiple forces and then abandoned to fend for yourself? Intersectionality seemed to do it for me.", "en": " 法律 －法律就像是來到現場的救護車 它準備好治療艾瑪但只有當（法官）查證確認 她是在種族歧視或性別歧視的路上受傷， 而不是在兩條路的交叉處時。（艾瑪才能得到治療） 如果你被多重力量傷害， 然後被迫放棄保護自己，這個情形你會稱之為什麼？ 我認為「交叉性」還不錯。"}, {"zh-tw": " I would go on to learnthat African-American women, like other women of color, like other socially marginalized peopleall over the world, were facing all kindsof dilemmas and challenges as a consequence of intersectionality, intersections of race and gender, of heterosexism, transphobia,xenophobia, ableism, all of these social dynamics come together and create challengesthat are sometimes quite unique. But in the same way that intersectionality raised our awareness to the waythat black women live their lives, it also exposes the tragic circumstances under which African-American women die.", "en": " 我接著得知非裔婦女， 像其他有色婦女， 像世界各地的其他社會邊緣的人， 身為交叉性的結果， 都面對種種困境和挑戰， 種族和性別的交叉歧視， 異性戀，變性者，仇外心理，能力主義的交叉歧視， 所有這些社會歧視聚集在一起 創造出有時是相當罕見的挑戰。 但是以同樣方式 交叉性 提高了我們對於黑人婦女生活的认识， 它也暴露了 非裔美國女性死亡的悲劇情況。"}, {"zh-tw": " Police violence against black women is very real. The level of violencethat black women face is such that it's not surprising that some of them do not survivetheir encounters with police.", "en": " 警察對黑人婦女的暴力 是很真實的。 黑人婦女所面對的暴力的程度 使得她們其中一些人在遇到警察時沒有活下來 並不讓我們驚訝。"}, {"zh-tw": " Black girls as young as seven, great grandmothers as old as 95 have been killed by the police.
