The protesters who occupied Maidan, as the square is known, prepared for battle, stockpiling homemade weapons and mass-producing improvised body armor."}, {"zh-tw": "烏克蘭親歐盟示威在 2013 年底和平展開，就在烏克蘭總統維克多‧亞努科維奇拒絕與歐盟簽署影響極大的協議，以強化和俄羅斯的關係之後。為了回應這項做法，上萬名不滿的民眾湧進基輔市中心表達抗議。", "en": "The Euromaidan protests began peacefullyat the end of 2013, after the president of Ukraine,Viktor Yanukovych, rejected a far-reaching accordwith the European Union in favor of stronger ties with Russia. In response, tens of thousandsof dissatisfied citizens poured into central Kievto demonstrate against this allegiance."}, {"zh-tw": "經過幾個月，警民的對峙加深。我臨時在赫雪司基街的護欄邊搭了攝影棚，", "en": "As the months passed, confrontations between policeand civilians intensified. I set up a makeshift portrait studioby the barricades on Hrushevsky Street."}, {"zh-tw": "以黑簾為背景拍攝示威者，黑簾遮蔽了視覺性強且引人注意的背景：槍火、白雪與黑煙。為了述說每個人的故事，我覺得有必要移除這些引人注目的背景，那些在主流媒體裡不停重覆人們熟悉的景象。", "en": "There, I photographedthe fighters against a black curtain, a curtain that obscuredthe highly seductive and visual backdrop of fire, ice and smoke. In order to tell the individualhuman stories here, I felt that I needed to removethe dramatic visuals that had become so familiar and repetitivewithin the mainstream media."}, {"zh-tw": "我所目睹的不只是新聞，還有歷史。有了這項體認，我便不受傳統攝影新聞拘束，有別於其他報紙雜誌。", "en": "What I was witnessingwas not only news, but also history. With this realization, I was free fromthe photojournalistic conventions of the newspaper and the magazine."}, {"zh-tw": "歐雷格、瓦西里和邁可森都是平凡人，住在平凡的小鎮過著平凡的生活。但他們穿上的精緻服裝非常特別。", "en": "Oleg, Vasiliy and Maximwere all ordinary men, with ordinary lives from ordinary towns. But the elaborate costumesthat they had bedecked themselves in were quite extraordinary."}, {"zh-tw": "我用服裝這個詞是因為這些衣服並不是有人負責協調或統一發放的，而是臨時的制服，用退役的軍用裝備改製，配上淘汰的軍備跟向警方取得的戰利品。", "en": "I say the word \"costume\" because these were not clothesthat had been issued or coordinated by anyone. They were improvised uniforms made up of decommissionedmilitary equipment, irregular combat fatiguesand trophies taken from the police."}, {"zh-tw": "我對於他們選擇呈現的樣子很感興趣，他們這種非常具男子氣概的表現就是戰士的樣子。我慢慢地用底片相機拍攝，用手動對焦與手持式曝光錶。", "en": "I became interested in the way theywere choosing to represent themselves, this outward expression of masculinity, the ideal of the warrior. I worked slowly,using an analog film camera with a manual focusing loopand a handheld light meter."}, {"zh-tw": "這種拍攝方式過時了，但讓我有時間跟每個人對話，在他們回望我的同時，安靜地與他們對看。", "en": "The process is old-fashioned. It gives me time to speak with each person and to look at them, in silence,while they look back at me."}, {"zh-tw": "雙方對峙的緊張情勢在充滿暴力的二月二十日這天爆發，也是後來為人所知的血腥星期四。效忠政府的狙擊手開始在學院街上對著平民和抗議者開槍，", "en": "Rising tensions culminatedin the worst day of violence on February 20, which became known as Bloody Thursday. Snipers, loyal to the government, started firing on the civiliansand protesters on Institutskaya Street."}, {"zh-tw": "短時間內造成很多人死亡。烏克蘭飯店的大廳變成臨時停屍間。", "en": "Many were killedin a very short space of time.

And there was bloodall over the pavements."}, {"zh-tw": "隔天，亞努科維奇總統逃離烏克蘭。簡言之，三個月的抗爭導致超過 120 人死亡，許多人失蹤。", "en": "The following day,President Yanukovych fled Ukraine. In all, three months of protests resulted in more than 120 confirmed dead and many more missing."}, {"zh-tw": "事件很快就結束，但獨立廣場上絲毫不見欣喜之情。隨著日子過去，基輔的中央廣場除了武裝鬥士，更有成千上萬名平民參與，湧上街頭集體哀悼逝者。", "en": "History unfolded quickly, but celebration remainedelusive in Maidan. As the days passedin Kiev's central square, streams of armed fighters were joined by tens of thousandsof ordinary people, filling the streets in an actof collective mourning."}, {"zh-tw": "很多女性帶著鮮花放在地上向逝者致敬。他們每天上街頭，在廣場內擺滿了上百萬朵花。", "en": "Many were women who often carried flowers that they had brought to layas marks of respect for the dead. They came day after day and they covered the squarewith millions of flowers."}, {"zh-tw": "廣場被悲傷掩沒，安靜到我能聽見鳥鳴，", "en": "Sadness enveloped Maidan. It was quiet and I could hearthe birds singing."}, {"zh-tw": "這是前所未有的景象。我叫住那些走到柵欄前要向逝者致意的人，問她們是否願意讓我拍照。", "en": "I hadn't heard that before. I stopped womenas they approached the barricades to lay their tributes and asked to make their picture."}, {"zh-tw": "我拍照時，很多女性都哭了。第一天，我和助理艾密內都跟每位來拍照的女人一起哭。", "en": "Most women cried when I photographed them. On the first day,my fixer, Emine, and I cried with almost every womanwho visited our studio."}, {"zh-tw": "女性顯然缺席了許久，直到這一刻才現身。她們淺色的大衣、鮮艷的手提包，手上一束束的紅色康乃馨、白色鬱金香與黃色玫瑰花和滿是黑色的廣場以及被困在此的陰鬱男子顯得格格不入。", "en": "There had been such a noticeableabsence of women up until that point. And the color of their pastel coats, their shiny handbags, and the bunches of red carnations, white tulips and yellow rosesthat they carried jarred with the blackened square and the blackened menwho were encamped there."}, {"zh-tw": "我很清楚這兩組照片單獨看來不太合理。照片上的是男人與女人本身的體現，不是外表，而是本質。", "en": "It is clear to methat these two sets of pictures don't make much sense without the other. They are about men and womenand the way we are -- not the way we look,but the way we are."}, {"zh-tw": "照片述說著不同性別在衝突中的角色，不只在獨立廣場，不只在烏克蘭而已。男人披掛上陣；女人獻花哀悼。", "en": "They speak about differentgender roles in conflict, not only in Maidan,and not only in Ukraine. Men fight most wars and women mourn them."}, {"zh-tw": "如果說男人展現了勇士的樣貌，那女人正是這種暴力的體現。拍攝這些照片時，我相信我在記錄烏克蘭暴力事件的結束。", "en": "If the men showedthe ideal of the warrior, then the women showedthe implications of such violence. When I made these pictures, I believed that I was documentingthe end of violent events in Ukraine."}, {"zh-tw": "但現在我相信這是記錄一種開始。今天，死亡人數達到約三千人，還有數十萬人流離失所。", "en": "But now I understandthat it is a record of the beginning. Today, the death toll stands around 3,000, while hundreds of thousandshave been displaced."}, {"zh-tw": "我六週前又回到烏克蘭。獨立廣場的護欄已經拆卸完畢，抗議時用來當武器的鋪路石也都不見了，所以現在廣場的交通又恢復正常。", "en": "I was in Ukraine again six weeks ago. In Maidan, the barricadeshave been dismantled, and the paving stones which were usedas weapons during the protests replaced, so that traffic flows freelythrough the center of the square."}, {"zh-tw": "抗議者、女人和鮮花都不見了。一片巨大廣告牆上畫的是一隻鵝飛過麥田，遮蓋了工會大樓外牆的斑駁痕跡，上頭寫著：「烏克蘭萬歲；", "en": "The fighters, the womenand the flowers are gone. A huge billboard depicting geeseflying over a wheat field covers the burned-out shellof the trade union's building and proclaims, \"Glory to Ukraine."}, {"zh-tw": "英雄萬歲。」謝謝。", "en": "Glory to heroes.\" Thank you. ."}], "title": "Anastasia Taylor Lind Fighters And Mourners Of The Ukrainian Revolution"}
