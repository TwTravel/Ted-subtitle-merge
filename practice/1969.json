Curiosity and wonder, because it drives us to explore, because we're surroundedby things we can't see. And I love to use filmto take us on a journey through portals of time and space, to make the invisible visible, because what that does, it expands our horizons, it transforms our perception, it opens our minds and it touches our heart."}, {"zh-tw": "這些片段出自我的 3D IMAX 電影《世界不為人知的奧祕》。（音樂）有些萬物變化太慢以致於人眼難以偵測。縮時攝影讓我們能察覺這些變化，並讓人生視野更加開闊。我們能看見生物體的形成與成長，藤蔓是如何從森林地表探出頭來", "en": "So here are some scenesfrom my 3D IMAX film, \"Mysteries of the Unseen World.\" (Music) There is movement which is too slowfor our eyes to detect, and time lapse makes us discover and broaden our perspective of life. We can see how organisms emerge and grow, how a vine survives by creepingfrom the forest floor to look at the sunlight."}, {"zh-tw": "仰望日光。大規模來看，縮時攝影讓我們能看見地球的一舉一動。不只能看到大自然的生生不息，還能觀察人類不停息的活動。", "en": "And at the grand scale, time lapse allows us to seeour planet in motion. We can view not onlythe vast sweep of nature, but the restless movement of humanity."}, {"zh-tw": "每條線都代表客機的行經路線，藉著將航空交通數據轉為縮時影像，就能看到在我們上空，不斷活動卻讓人看不見的東西：美國上空廣大的航空網。也能如此觀察海洋船舶活動。", "en": "Each streaking dotrepresents a passenger plane, and by turning air traffic datainto time-lapse imagery, we can see somethingthat's above us constantly but invisible: the vast network of air travelover the United States. We can do the same thingwith ships at sea."}, {"zh-tw": "我們能將數據轉換為全球經濟活動的縮時影像。幾十年的數據讓我們能夠將整個星球視為單一有機體。洋流穿過各大洋、雲團盤繞於大氣層中，與閃電一起脈動北極光有如王冠一般。", "en": "We can turn data into a time-lapse viewof a global economy in motion. And decades of data give usthe view of our entire planet as a single organism sustained by currents circulatingthroughout the oceans and by clouds swirlingthrough the atmosphere, pulsing with lightning, crowned by the aurora Borealis."}, {"zh-tw": "這可能是終極縮時影像。地球的千變萬化活生生的呈現在眼前。相反地，有些活動快到人眼無法捕捉，但我們也有技術可以破解這難題。", "en": "It may be the ultimate time-lapse image: the anatomy of Earth brought to life. At the other extreme, there are things that movetoo fast for our eyes, but we have technologythat can look into that world as well."}, {"zh-tw": "有了高速攝影機，可達到與縮時攝影相反的效果。可以拍攝到比人類視覺極限快上幾千倍的影像。", "en": "With high-speed cameras, we can do the opposite of time lapse. We can shoot images that are thousands of timesfaster than our vision."}, {"zh-tw": "我們可以看到大自然的造化神功，或許還能加以模仿。當蜻蜓振翅飛過時，你可能沒發現，但牠們是自然界最棒的飛行家，", "en": "And we can see how nature'singenious devices work, and perhaps we can even imitate them. When a dragonfly flutters by, you may not realize, but it's the greatest flier in nature."}, {"zh-tw": "可以盤旋在空中、向後飛，甚至倒著飛。利用追蹤標記牠們的翅膀，可以看到牠們創造出的氣流。", "en": "It can hover, fly backwards, even upside down. And by tracking markerson an insect's wings, we can visualize the air flowthat they produce."}, {"zh-tw": "沒有人知道這個秘密，但高速攝影幫助我們看見了蜻蜓可以向不同方向同時移動四隻翅膀。我們所學到的，可以讓我們創造出新型飛行器，將人類視野擴展到", "en": "Nobody knew the secret, but high speed shows that a dragonfly can move all four wingsin different directions at the same time. And what we learn can lead usto new kinds of robotic flyers that can expand our vision of important and remote places."}, {"zh-tw": "重要且偏遠的世界角落。我們是巨人，無法察覺週遭太渺小的事物。電子顯微鏡能發射出電子，產生影像，將事物放大到百萬倍之多。", "en": "We're giants, and we're unaware of thingsthat are too small for us to see. The electron microscopefires electrons which creates images which can magnify thingsby as much as a million times."}, {"zh-tw": "這是蝴蝶的卵。你身體上也有看不見的生物，包含塵蟎，終其一生都躲在你的眼睫毛中，", "en": "This is the egg of a butterfly. And there are unseen creaturesliving all over your body, including mitesthat spend their entire lives dwelling on your eyelashes, crawling over your skin at night."}, {"zh-tw": "夜晚時爬過你的肌膚。猜得出這是什麼嗎？鯊魚皮。毛毛蟲的嘴巴。", "en": "Can you guess what this is? Shark skin. A caterpillar's mouth."}, {"zh-tw": "果蠅的眼睛。蛋殼。", "en": "The eye of a fruit fly. An eggshell."}, {"zh-tw": "跳蚤。蝸牛的舌頭。", "en": "A flea. A snail's tongue."}, {"zh-tw": "我們以為早已了解動物世界，但或許還有上百萬微小物種等待被發掘。蜘蛛也有很多秘密，因為蜘蛛絲甚至比同等重量的鋼鐵還要強韌，但是充滿彈性。", "en": "We think we knowmost of the animal kingdom, but there may be millions of tiny species waiting to be discovered. A spider also has great secrets, because spiders' silk threadis pound for pound stronger than steel but completely elastic."}, {"zh-tw": "我將帶你一窺奈米的世界，蜘蛛絲比人類的頭髮還細一百倍。", "en": "This journey will take usall the way down to the nano world. The silk is 100 times thinnerthan human hair."}, {"zh-tw": "上頭有細菌，在細菌附近，比他更小十倍的，是病毒。病毒裡，更小十倍的地方，有三串 DNA，", "en": "On there is bacteria, and near that bacteria, 10 times smaller, a virus. Inside of that, 10 times smaller, three strands of DNA."}, {"zh-tw": "幾乎達到我們最強大顯微鏡的極限時，觀察到單一碳原子。利用強大顯微鏡的頂端，我們甚至可以移動原子，", "en": "And nearing the limitof our most powerful microscopes, single carbon atoms. With the tip of a powerful microscope, we can actually move atoms and begin to create amazing nano devices."}, {"zh-tw": "開始創造驚人的奈米儀器。它們有天或許能在人體中流動，對付各種疾病，沿路清掉阻塞的動脈。未來的微小化學儀器有天或許能夠修復 DNA。", "en": "Some could one day patrol our bodyfor all kinds of diseases and clean out clogged arteriesalong the way. Tiny chemical machines of the future can one day, perhaps, repair DNA."}, {"zh-tw": "我們離非凡成就僅有一步之遙，讓動力驅使我們揭開生命的秘密。在持續落下的宇宙塵埃裡，空氣充滿花粉、來自其他星球的微鑽石或珠寶，還有超級星爆炸。", "en": "We are on the thresholdof extraordinary advances, born of our driveto unveil the mysteries of life. So under an endless rain of cosmic dust, the air is full of pollen, micro-diamonds and jewels from other planetsand supernova explosions."}, {"zh-tw": "我們日常生活中充滿看不見的東西。知道身邊有那麼多東西值得我們張大眼睛看，將永遠改變人類對世界的認知。藉由一窺這些不為人知的世界，我們能了解到我們活在具生命的宇宙中，這個新觀點將能創造驚奇，並賦予我們靈感，成為探險家，", "en": "People go about their livessurrounded by the unseeable. Knowing that there's so mucharound us we can't see forever changesour understanding of the world, and by looking at unseen worlds, we recognize that we existin the living universe, and this new perspective creates wonder and inspires us to become explorers in our own backyards."}, {"zh-tw": "就算是家中後院也好。誰知道還有哪些東西等待被發掘，或是有哪些新奇東西將改變人類生命。讓我們等著瞧吧。", "en": "Who knows what awaits to be seen and what new wonderswill transform our lives. We'll just have to see."}, {"zh-tw": "謝謝。", "en": "Thank you."}], "title": "Louie Schwartzberg Hidden Miracles Of The Natural World"}
