And that was largely because there weren't any."}, {"zh-tw": "我呢，最近在忙著進行一些計畫，其中一個計畫，叫肉豆蔻號（Nutmeg），這是一艘1930年代的救生船，放在我英國海邊小屋的花園裏，我正著手整修。", "en": "So I've been busy with a couple of projects, and one of them was this: The Nutmeg. A 1930s ship's lifeboat, which I've been restoring in the garden of my beach house in England."}, {"zh-tw": "現在呢，假如極地冰帽融化了，我的錄音工作室就會浮起來，像諾亞方舟一樣，而我就在被水淹沒的世界上載浮載沉，像巴拉德（J. G. Ballard）小説中的角色一樣。白天的時候，肉豆蔻號會收集能源，她的舵手室上方有太陽能面板，桅杆上也有450瓦的風電渦輪。", "en": "And, so now, when the polar ice caps melt, my recording studio will rise up like an ark, and I'll float off into the drowned world like a character from a J.G. Ballard novel. During the day, the Nutmeg collects energy from solar panels on the roof of the wheelhouse, and from a 450 watt turbine up the mast."}, {"zh-tw": "所以，天黑的時候，我會有充足的能源。我可以讓肉豆蔻號如火炬般發出光亮。", "en": "So that when it gets dark, I've got plenty of power. And I can light up the Nutmeg like a beacon."}, {"zh-tw": "然後我會待在肉豆蔻號裏，直到凌晨時分。我就在裏頭作我的音樂。我想獻給各位，如果你們願意當我的第一號聽眾。", "en": "And so I go in there until the early hours of the morning, and I work on new songs. I'd like to play to you guys, if you're willing to be the first audience to hear it."}, {"zh-tw": "這首曲子是關於比莉‧哈樂代。據說，在1947年的某個夜晚，她從這世上，消失了一整晚，直到隔天早上才又出現。", "en": "It's about Billie Holiday. And it appears that, some night in 1947 she left her physical space and was missing all night, until she reappeared in the morning."}, {"zh-tw": "不過我知道她在哪兒。她和我在一起，在我的船上，", "en": "But I know where she was. She was with me on my lifeboat."}, {"zh-tw": "而且，她熱情如火。（音樂）比莉輕輕地進入我清醒的懷中溫熱如啜飲酸醪酒漿奇妙的果實滋味（Strange Fruit為哈樂代演唱的名曲）甜膩的無用之物在卡內基演奏廳上台前張惶失措爵士名伶臨陣脫逃非離開這裏不可我的人和我的心今晚在這搖搖欲墜的鋼琴椅上只有月亮為我見證她的氣息在我耳邊這，是愛情但愛情像上了膛的手槍破曉前她已離去穿過冰封的河流，她回家了只剩我和Johnny Walker(酒名)在新世紀裏的孤獨身影留下來陪我今晚，再一次比莉，時間愛作弄人但我心中仍然有聲音回盪，說這，就是愛情", "en": "And she was hot.
