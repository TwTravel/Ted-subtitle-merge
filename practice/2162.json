And why? Because I was saving a minuteout of my commute.", "en": " 在這段單調的路途中 完全沒有享受這條路的愉悅 也沒有與大自然交流的樂趣 在路上，我根本不可能去看其他路人 爲什麽？ 因爲我想盡量減少上下班花費的時間，哪怕只是一分鍾"}, {"zh-tw": " Now let me ask you: Am I alone here? How many of you have never useda mapping app for finding directions? Most of you, if not all, have. And don't get me wrong -- mapping appsare the greatest game-changer for encouraging peopleto explore the city.", "en": " 現在讓我問一個問題：我是在場唯一經曆過此事的人嗎？ 有多少人從沒用過導航應用來確定方向？ 絕大多數的人都曾用過導航 也千萬別誤會我的意思導航的確也是改變社會的一大應用 它鼓勵人們去探索他們的城市"}, {"zh-tw": " You take your phone outand you know immediately where to go.

That's where our researchis going right now.", "en": " 他們都回憶起這些道路曾經的味道與聲音 我們便有了這樣一個地圖應用 它指出的路線 並不僅僅基於美觀， 而是建立在氣味、聲音與回憶上 這便是我們現在研究的目標"}, {"zh-tw": " More generally, my research, what it tries to do is avoidthe danger of the single path, to avoid robbing people of fullyexperiencing the city in which they live.
