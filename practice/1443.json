And is there somethingthat the rest of us can learn from this? The sport of competitive memorizingis driven by a kind of arms race where, every year, somebody comes up with a newway to remember more stuff more quickly, and then the rest of the fieldhas to play catch-up.

And while there are a whole host of ways of remembering stuffin these competitions, everything, all of the techniquesthat are being used, ultimately come down to a concept that psychologists refer toas \"elaborative encoding.\" And it's well-illustratedby a nifty paradox known as the Baker/baker paradox,which goes like this: If I tell two peopleto remember the same word, if I say to you, \"Remember thatthere is a guy named Baker.\" That's his name."}, {"zh-tw": "貝克是人名我又來告訴你 \"記住有個人是面包師(英文和貝克一樣)\"過了一段時間我又回來找到你們問 \"還記得我之前叫你們記住的那個詞嗎?\"”還記得是什麽詞嗎?“被告知人名是貝克的人記住這個詞的可能性遠不如被告知職業是面包師的那個人同樣的詞 導致不同的記憶程度", "en": "And I say to you, \"Rememberthat there is a guy who is a baker.\" Okay? And I come back to youat some point later on, and I say, \"Do you remember that wordthat I told you a while back? Do you remember what it was?\" The person who was told his name is Baker is less likely to remember the same word than the person was toldhis job is a baker. Same word, different amountof remembering; that's weird."}, {"zh-tw": "到底是爲什麽呢是因爲 人名Baker沒有任何特殊含義沒法跟你腦海裏零碎繁雜的記憶産生任何聯系", "en": "What's going on here? Well, the name Bakerdoesn't actually mean anything to you. It is entirely untetheredfrom all of the other memories floating around in your skull."}, {"zh-tw": "但是面包師作爲一個常用名詞我們都知道面包師是什麽面包師帶著搞笑的白帽子", "en": "But the common noun \"baker\" --we know bakers.

And when we first hear that word, we start putting theseassociational hooks into it, that make it easier to fish itback out at some later date."}, {"zh-tw": "其實 要理解記憶競賽中的一切奧妙或在日常生活中改善記憶力的秘訣僅僅在于想辦法把Baker中的大寫B變爲面包師(baker)中的小寫b把沒有前因後果沒有重要性 沒有涵義的信息用某種方法轉化爲有意義的內容跟腦海裏的其他記憶串聯起來這種精確記憶的技巧在兩千五百年前的古希臘就已出現", "en": "The entire art of what is going onin these memory contests, and the entire art of rememberingstuff better in everyday life, is figuring out waysto transform capital B Bakers into lower-case B bakers -- to take informationthat is lacking in context, in significance, in meaning, and transform it in some way, so that it becomes meaningfulin the light of all the other things that you have in your mind. One of the more elaboratetechniques for doing this dates back 2,500 years to Ancient Greece."}, {"zh-tw": "後來將其稱爲記憶宮殿發明這種技巧的過程如下有個叫做西蒙奈德的詩人他要去參加一個晚宴", "en": "It came to be known as the memory palace. The story behind its creationgoes like this: There was a poet called Simonides,who was attending a banquet."}, {"zh-tw": "其實他算是被請去做表演嘉賓的因爲在那個年代 炫酷派對的標准不是請D.J.來打碟 而是要請詩人來頌詩他站起來 背出了他的全篇詩作 然後潇灑離去他剛走出門口 晚宴大廳就塌了", "en": "He was actually the hired entertainment, because back then, if you wantedto throw a really slamming party, you didn't hire a D.J., you hired a poet. And he stands up, delivers his poemfrom memory, walks out the door, and at the moment he does, the banquet hall collapses."}, {"zh-tw": "砸死了裏面所有的人不僅全體死亡所有的死者都被砸得面目全非", "en": "Kills everybody inside. It doesn't just kill everybody, it mangles the bodiesbeyond all recognition."}, {"zh-tw": "沒人說得清死者都有些誰沒人說得清誰坐在哪兒導致死者的屍體沒法得到合適的殉葬安置", "en": "Nobody can say who was inside, nobody can say where they were sitting. The bodies can't be properly buried."}, {"zh-tw": "這又加重了整件事的悲劇色彩西蒙奈德站在外面作爲廢墟中的唯一幸存者閉上眼睛 猛然意識到在他的腦海中他眼前出現了所有賓客所坐的位置", "en": "It's one tragedy compounding another. Simonides, standing outside, the sole survivor amid the wreckage, closes his eyes and has this realization, which is that in his mind's eye, he can see where each of the guestsat the banquet had been sitting."}, {"zh-tw": "他就牽著親屬們的手穿過廢墟 把他們帶到了親人身邊西蒙奈德當時猛然醒悟的事大概我們大家也都猜到了其實是 不管我們有多不善于記住姓名 電話號碼或是同事的每句指令我們都擁有異常敏銳的視覺或空間記憶能力", "en": "And he takes the relatives by the hand, and guides them eachto their loved ones amid the wreckage. What Simonides figured out at that moment, is something that I thinkwe all kind of intuitively know, which is that, as bad as we areat remembering names and phone numbers, and word-for-word instructionsfrom our colleagues, we have really exceptionalvisual and spatial memories."}, {"zh-tw": "要是我讓你們逐字逐句地重述我剛才講的西蒙奈德故事的前十個字應該沒幾個人會記得但我敢打賭如果我讓你們現在回想下在你的門廳裏 坐在會講話的棕色駿馬上的是誰", "en": "If I asked you to recountthe first 10 words of the story that I just told you about Simonides, chances are you would havea tough time with it. But, I would wagerthat if I asked you to recall who is sitting on topof a talking tan horse in your foyer right now, you would be able to see that."}, {"zh-tw": "你們就明白我剛才說的意思了記憶宮殿的原理就是在你的腦海裏建立一棟想象大廈並讓你想記住的東西的影像充滿其中越是瘋狂 古怪 奇詭荒誕搞笑 亂七八糟 招人厭惡的影像就越容易記住這個建議來自于兩千多年前拉丁最早的記憶學者", "en": "The idea behind the memory palace is to create this imagined edificein your mind's eye, and populate it with imagesof the things that you want to remember -- the crazier, weirder, more bizarre, funnier, raunchier, stinkier the image is, the more unforgettable it's likely to be. This is advice that goesback 2,000-plus years to the earliest Latin memory treatises."}, {"zh-tw": "那麽 這種說法的原理到底是什麽呢假設你被邀請站上TED的中心講台演講而你想脫稿完成如西塞羅在兩千年前在TEDx羅馬上的演講一般他就會這麽霸氣走一回 而你也想這樣你要做的就是想象自己站在自家門前", "en": "So how does this work? Let's say that you've been invitedto TED center stage to give a speech, and you want to do it from memory, and you want to do it the waythat Cicero would have done it, if he had been invitedto TEDxRome 2,000 years ago. What you might do is picture yourselfat the front door of your house."}, {"zh-tw": "然後憑空想象出一段完全荒誕瘋狂難忘的景象用來提示你上台要提的第一件事就是這場詭異的裸騎大賽然後你走進房子裏想到甜餅怪物坐在Ed先生背上的樣子", "en": "And you'd come up with some sortof crazy, ridiculous, unforgettable image, to remind you that the first thingyou want to talk about is this totally bizarre contest. And then you'd go inside your house, and you would see an imageof Cookie Monster on top of Mister Ed."}, {"zh-tw": "這個景象會提醒你要介紹你的朋友Ed Cook然後你腦海裏出現了小甜甜布蘭妮的樣子你就會想起要講那個關于布蘭妮的小故事", "en": "And that would remind you that you would want to thenintroduce your friend Ed Cook. And then you'd seean image of Britney Spears to remind you of this funnyanecdote you want to tell."}, {"zh-tw": "然後你走進廚房你要說到的第四個話題是你花了一整年走過的奇妙曆程通過綠野仙蹤就可以聯想得到這就是羅馬演說家背誦演講稿的秘訣並非一字不差 逐字背誦只會平添麻煩而是記住一個個主題", "en": "And you'd go into your kitchen, and the fourth topicyou were going to talk about was this strange journeythat you went on for a year, and you'd have some friendsto help you remember that. This is how Roman oratorsmemorized their speeches -- not word-for-word, which is justgoing to screw you up, but topic-for-topic."}, {"zh-tw": "其實 短語\"主題句\"就來源于希臘詞\"topos\"意思是\"地點\"這是古時候人們談到演講或是修辭時會用到的空間術語短語 \"第一\"就意味著你的記憶宮殿的第一層這簡直太有意思了我對這起了很大的興趣", "en": "In fact, the phrase \"topic sentence\" -- that comes from the Greek word \"topos,\" which means \"place.\" That's a vestige of when people usedto think about oratory and rhetoric in these sorts of spatial terms. The phrase \"in the first place,\" that's like \"in the first placeof your memory palace.\" I thought this was just fascinating, and I got really into it."}, {"zh-tw": "後來我又去了更多記憶大賽我開始萌發了要更詳細描寫這種競技記憶文化的念頭", "en": "And I went to a few moreof these memory contests, and I had this notionthat I might write something longer about this subcultureof competitive memorizers. But there was a problem."}, {"zh-tw": "但有一個問題問題是記憶大賽其實過程很無聊的(大笑)真的 就像一群人坐那兒高考一樣最最激動人心的時刻也不過就是有人揉了揉太陽穴", "en": "The problem was that a memory contest is a pathologically boring event. Truly, it is like a bunch of peoplesitting around taking the SATs -- I mean, the most dramatic it gets is when somebodystarts massaging their temples."}, {"zh-tw": "我是個記者 總得有東西可寫呀我知道這些人腦子裏肯定是驚濤駭浪但我作爲外人無法得見", "en": "And I'm a journalist,I need something to write about. I know that there's incredible stuffhappening in these people's minds, but I don't have access to it."}, {"zh-tw": "我意識到 若我真的想報道這事兒一定得親身體驗才行所以我開始嘗試著每天早上坐下來看紐約時報前花上十五到二十分鍾嘗試記憶一些事", "en": "And I realized, if I was goingto tell this story, I needed to walkin their shoes a little bit. And so I started tryingto spend 15 or 20 minutes every morning, before I satdown with my New York Times, just trying to remember something."}, {"zh-tw": "背背小詩背背我在跳蚤市場買來的舊年鑒裏的人名我驚奇地發現這其實非常帶勁", "en": "Maybe it was a poem, maybe it was names from an old yearbookthat I bought at a flea market. And I found that this was shockingly fun."}, {"zh-tw": "要不去嘗試根本想不到有趣在于 其實目標並不是要通過訓練提高記憶力", "en": "I never would have expected that. It was fun because this is actuallynot about training your memory."}, {"zh-tw": "而是你在努力培養改善創造力 想象力在你的腦海裏憑空造出那些完全滑稽荒誕胡亂 最好是難忘的影像而它成爲了我的樂趣", "en": "What you're doing, is you're tryingto get better and better at creating, at dreaming up, these utterly ludicrous,raunchy, hilarious, and hopefully unforgettableimages in your mind's eye. And I got pretty into it."}, {"zh-tw": "這是我戴著標准競賽記憶者訓練套裝的樣子它有一對耳塞一副護目鏡 鏡面全部遮黑就留了兩個小孔因爲競技記憶者最大的敵人就是注意力分散", "en": "This is me wearing my standardcompetitive memorizer's training kit. It's a pair of earmuffs and a set of safety gogglesthat have been masked over except for two small pinholes, because distraction is the competitivememorizer's greatest enemy."}, {"zh-tw": "最後 我再次回到了一年前報道的那場競賽場上我一時衝動 也想報名參加就當做參與性新聞報道的實驗了我當時想 到時能在前言裏調侃一下自己也好", "en": "I ended up coming backto that same contest that I had covered a year earlier, and I had this notionthat I might enter it, sort of as an experimentin participatory journalism. It'd make, I thought, maybea nice epilogue to all my research."}, {"zh-tw": "問題是 實驗最後得到了意想不到的結果那場競賽我贏了真是完全出乎我預料之外(鼓掌)", "en": "Problem was, the experiment went haywire. I won the contest -- which really wasn't supposed to happen."}, {"zh-tw": "對我來說現在背演講稿 電話號碼 或是購物單都是小菜一碟 倒是很不錯但其實這些都不重要了這些都是小伎倆", "en": "Now, it is nice to be ableto memorize speeches and phone numbers and shopping lists, but it's actually kindof beside the point. These are just tricks."}, {"zh-tw": "這些記憶伎倆之所以有效是因爲它們依仗人類大腦運轉的一些基本原理並不用真的去建立記憶宮殿或記下幾副牌的順序你也完全可以從了解大腦運轉原理中獲得一些益處", "en": "They work because they're basedon some pretty basic principles about how our brains work. And you don't have to bebuilding memory palaces or memorizing packs of playing cards to benefit from a little bit of insightabout how your mind works."}, {"zh-tw": "我們總會議論記憶力很好的人總覺得那些人是天賦異禀事實並不是這樣強大的記憶力是可以習得的", "en": "We often talk about peoplewith great memories as though it were some sortof an innate gift, but that is not the case.
