I went to see my mother the other day,and she told me this story that I'd completelyforgotten about how, when we were driving together,she would pull the car over, and by the time she hadgotten out of the car, and gone around the carto let me out of the car, I would have already gotten out of the car and pretended to have died. Because that's how you die.", "en": " 有時你所忘記的事情很有趣， 有一天，我去看望我的媽媽，她給我講了個故事， 而我早已全然忘記 我們是什麼時候、如何開車一起出行，她把車停靠在路邊， 然後那個時候，她下了車， 走到車的另一邊讓我下車， 那時，我其實早已下車， 躺在地上裝死。 因為人就是這麼死的。"}, {"zh-tw": " And I remember, that was a gameI used to play with myself to entertain myself wheneverI was bored or frustrated. Settle down.", "en": " 我記得，每當自己感到無聊或者難過時， 我就會這麼做來讓自己開心。 大家淡定點。"}, {"zh-tw": " People say we live in an ageof information overload. Right? I don't know about that, but I just know that I gettoo many marketing emails. I got a marketing emailfrom a supermarket firm, which will remain nameless for predominantly legal reasons, but which I'm going to call \"SafeMart.\" I got an email from them,and it went like this, it said: \"Just three weeks until SafeMartat King's Cross opens!!!\" And I resented this, because not only do I not remembersigning up to that, but I resent the factthat they appear to think that I should be excitedabout a shop opening.", "en": " 人們常說我們身處一個信息過剩的時代，對吧？ 對此我並不了解， 我只知道，我收到的營銷郵件確實過剩。 我收到過一封超市公司發來的營銷郵件， 考慮到法律因素， 公司的名字我在此就不提了， 姑且叫它“沃安心“。 我收到的這封郵件，是這麼說的： “距國王十字街沃安心盛大開業只剩三周！！！” 我挺討厭這個的， 不光是因為我不記得自己訂閱過推送， 我討厭它，因為 他們似乎認為我為新店開業感到激動。"}, {"zh-tw": " So what I did was I scrolled downto the bottom of the email, and I pressed, \"Unsubscribe.\" And I thought that'd be the end of it. But a week later,I got another one that said, \"Just two weeks until SafeMart at King's Cross opens!!!\" And I thought, obviously,I haven't clicked hard enough.", "en": " 所以，我把郵件拖到底端， 然後點了“取消關注”。 我以為這件事就這麼完了。 但是一周以後，我又收到一封， 郵件寫道： “距國王十字街沃安心盛大開業只剩兩周！！！” 我想一定是自己沒有退訂成功。"}, {"zh-tw": " So I tried it again. Right? Lo and behold, a week passes,you guessed it, \"Just one week until SafeMartat King's Cross opens!!!\" And here's the problem: The internet gave us access to everything; but it also gave everything access to us. It's hard enough to discriminate between the things that genuinelymatter in this world and the minutiae of life, without having emailsabout supermarket chains and Candy Crush Saga.", "en": " 所以我就再一次點擊取消關注。 結果一周以後，你猜怎麼著， “距國王十字街沃安心盛大開業只剩一周！！！” 然後，問題就來了： 我們通過互聯網洞悉世事， 但同時，外界也借助互聯網“洞悉”我們。 我們很難辨別， 什麼是真正關乎世界的大事， 是生活中的瑣事， 我們不需要連鎖超市和 “糖果粉碎傳奇”發來的郵件。"}, {"zh-tw": " And I was really annoyed with them, and I thought, OK, I was about to writea strongly worded email, which I can do quite well. And I thought, no -- I'm going to find the game.", "en": " 我對此很惱火， 然後我想，好吧，就讓我來寫一封長信， 這我挺拿手的。 後來，我想：這可不行， 我要跟他們玩個遊戲，"}, {"zh-tw": " So I replied to it, and I said, \"I literally cannot wait!!!!\" \"What do you need from me?\" They got back to me;a guy called Dan said, \"Hi James. I've asked a colleagueto help me with your query.\" Like it needs help. And I said, \"What's the plan, Dan? I'm thinking fireworks, bouncy castle ...\" \"I'm not sure what you mean.\" I said, \"I'm just tremendouslyexcited about the opening!\" \"Do you want to bookthe bouncy castle or shall I?\" He said, \"I think you have misunderstood.\" \"A new store is opening,but there is no celebration planned.\" I said, \"But what was all the 'Three weeksuntil,' 'Two weeks until' emails? I was getting excited.\" \"I'm sorry you're disappointed.\" I said, \"Not to worry.", "en": " 所以，我回复了他們，信中寫道， “我真是迫不及待呀！！！” ”我有什麼能幫到你們嗎？“ 一個名叫丹的人回复了我，他說 “你好，詹姆斯。我找了一個同事來幫忙解決你的疑問。 我裝作以為他們需要幫忙。 然後說，“計劃得如何，丹？ 我能想到的是煙花和充氣城堡...“ ”我沒弄懂你在說什麼。“ 我回答道，”我只是對於開業感到非常激動！“ ”你想要訂購充氣城堡嗎，或者我可以幫忙？“ 他說，“我想你是誤解了。” “新店確實是要開業了，但是並沒有慶祝計畫。” “但是那些三週、兩週的倒計時郵件是什麼呢？ 我白激動一場啊。“ “很抱歉讓您失望了。” 我回复道，”別擔心，"}, {"zh-tw": " Let's do something anyway! Besides, the deposit on the bouncycastle was non-refundable.\" \"If we don't use it, we're outa few hundred quid, Dan.\" He said, \"Mr. Veitch, I'm not responsiblefor anything you have ordered.\" I said, \"Let's not get into who did what. Bottom line: you and Iare in this together.\" \"Question: Will you be thereto make sure people take their shoes off?\" I'll be honest, then my relationshipwith Dan deteriorated somewhat, because the next email I got was this: \"Thanks for your email -your Case Number is ...\" That's outrageous.", "en": " 無論如何，我們得做點什麼！“ 另外，訂購充氣城堡的錢可是不退的喔。” “如果我們不用它，那可是浪費了幾百磅啊，丹。” 他說，“威馳先生，我不對您訂購的任何物資負責。” 我回答，“我們先不要糾結誰做了什麼。 最後一行：“你和我都與此事相關。” “請問：你會到場確保人們脫鞋進入嗎？” 實話實說，自那以後，我和丹鬧僵了， 因為接下來的郵件是這樣的， \"謝謝您的來信，您的問題編碼為...\" 這可是很無理的"}, {"zh-tw": " I said, \"Dan?\" And I got -- and I was just like,this is ... -- and I, I .... And I said, \"Danny?\" And I thought, this is terrible.All I'm doing is collecting case numbers.", "en": " 我問，”丹,你在嗎？“ 然後回信是，我回复，”我是...,我... 後來，我說，“丹尼？” 我想，這真是糟糕，我現在就是在收集問題編碼呀，"}, {"zh-tw": " I said, \"D-Dog?\" \"The store is now open.\" I said, \"But Dan, they must have wonderedwhy there was no bouncy castle.\" And then we were back to this. And that might have beenthe end of the story, but I rememberedthat anything -- everything -- even something as mundaneas getting out of a car, can be fun if you find the right game.", "en": " 我又寫信，“丹尼狗？” “店鋪現在開業了。” “但是，丹，人們一定在想為什麼會沒有充氣城堡。” 然後對話又變成了這個。 這個故事可能就這麼結束了， 但是我認為，任何事情-所有事情- 就算是像下車這種平常小事， 也可以在遊戲中變得很有趣。"}, {"zh-tw": " So, this is what I replied: [Thanks for your email -your Case Number is #0000001.] And we just, uh ... It was like we were dancing.", "en": " 所以， 我是這樣回复的， 『感謝您的來信，您的問題編碼為#0000001.』 （鼓掌） 然後我們就... 就像是我們在翩翩起舞。"}, {"zh-tw": " It was just a beautiful relationship. We just kept going.", "en": " 一場美妙的關係 我們就這樣持續下去"}, {"zh-tw": " It was lovely. But to be honest, guys,it was quite labor-intensive, and I had other stuff to do, believe it or not.", "en": " 太可愛了 但是說實話，朋友們，這確實挺耗費人力的， 不管你信不信， 我真的還有很多事情要忙。"}, {"zh-tw": " So what I did is I have a little emailauto-replier program. And I set it up so every timeit receives an email from SafeMart, it just pings one back.", "en": " 所以我做了一個郵件自動回复程序。 設置好後，每次收到\"沃安心“的郵件， 程序就會自動回复，"}, {"zh-tw": " So I set it up, and it says, \"Thanks for your email -your Case Number is ...\" Then it has a little formula that I wroteto up the case number every time. And I put it on the server and set it running.", "en": " 我是這樣設置的， ”謝謝您的來信，您的問題編碼為...“ 並且我設置程序每次都增加編碼上的數字。 我轉到服務器， 並啟動了這個程序。"}, {"zh-tw": " I'll be honest, guys -- then I forgot about it. I checked back on it the other day, and it appears there have beena number of emails going back and forth.", "en": " 朋友們，我不得不說-- 我把這件事完全拋擲腦後了， 後來有一天，我查看郵箱， 上面顯示了好多來來往往的郵件。"}, {"zh-tw": " We're on 21,439. It gives me an immensesense of satisfaction to know that these computer programsare just going to be pinging one another for eternity.", "en": " 我們已經達到21439封了 （鼓掌） 我感到巨大的滿足， 我發現這個電腦程序會讓我們之間的郵件往來 永無止境的持續下去。"}, {"zh-tw": " And as legacies go,I don't think that's bad. So guys, just remember: if ever you feel weighed downby the bureaucracy and often mundanity of modern life, don't fight the frustration.", "en": " 我並不覺得這種持續不好。 所以朋友們，請記住： 如果有天你被官僚制度 以及各種現代生活中的俗事壓身， 不要與沮喪抗爭。"}, {"zh-tw": " Let it be the catalyst for whimsy. Thank you.", "en": " 讓它變成一種催化劑， 催生出各種奇思妙想。 謝謝。"}], "title": "James Veitch The Agony Of Trying To Unsubscribe"}
