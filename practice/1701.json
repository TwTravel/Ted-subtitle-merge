We're going to use an unusual combination of tools from game theory and neuroscience to understand how people interact socially when value is on the line. So game theory is a branch of, originally, applied mathematics, used mostly in economics and political science, a little bit in biology, that gives us a mathematical taxonomy of social life and it predicts what people are likely to do and believe others will do in cases where everyone's actions affect everyone else.", "en": " 我要說說大腦決策 我們要用一些不尋常組合的工具 從賽局理論到神經科學 以瞭解利益糾葛時大眾的互動 賽局理論源自應用數學 主要用在經濟和政治學很少被應用在生物學上 它提供了關於社會行為的數學模型 當人的行為會互相影響時 它可以用來預測當人類行為會互相影響時 人可能會採取的行動"}, {"zh-tw": " That's a lot of things: competition, cooperation, bargaining, games like hide-and-seek, and poker. Here's a simple game to get us started.", "en": " 這包含很多事：競爭、合作、議價 一些像是捉迷藏和撲克牌的遊戲 我們用一個簡單的遊戲開始吧"}, {"zh-tw": " Everyone chooses a number from zero to 100, we're going to compute the average of those numbers, and whoever's closest to two-thirds of the average wins a fixed prize. So you want to be a little bit below the average number, but not too far below, and everyone else wants to be a little bit below the average number as well.", "en": " 每個人從 0 到 100 間選一個數字 我們會計算這些數值的平均 選擇最接近平均值 2/3 數值的人贏 所以你會需要比平均值低一點的數值 但又不要太低而且每個人都會想要 選比平均值低一些的數值"}, {"zh-tw": " Think about what you might pick. As you're thinking, this is a toy model of something like selling in the stock market during a rising market. Right? You don't want to sell too early, because you miss out on profits, but you don't want to wait too late to when everyone else sells, triggering a crash.", "en": " 想想你會選什麼 你可能會想：這就像是股價上揚時 賣股票時機選擇的簡單模型 你不想太早賣因為你會減少獲利 但又不想太晚賣 因為大家都賣完後股價會崩盤"}, {"zh-tw": " You want to be a little bit ahead of the competition, but not too far ahead. Okay, here's two theories about how people might think about this, and then we'll see some data.", "en": " 所以你會想超前大家一步，但別過頭 好，對於大家的想法有兩種可能 然後我們看看數據"}, {"zh-tw": " Some of these will sound familiar because you probably are thinking that way. I'm using my brain theory to see. A lot of people say, \"I really don't know what people are going to pick, so I think the average will be 50.\" They're not being really strategic at all.", "en": " 有些聽起來可能會很熟悉 因為你就是這麼想因為我是用大腦理論分析出來 許多人會說：「我不知道大家會怎麼選， 但我知道平均值是 50。」 這其中沒有策略思考成份"}, {"zh-tw": " \"And I'll pick two-thirds of 50. That's 33.\" That's a start. Other people who are a little more sophisticated, using more working memory, say, \"I think people will pick 33 because they're going to pick a response to 50, and so I'll pick 22, which is two-thirds of 33.\" They're doing one extra step of thinking, two steps.", "en": " 「我會選 50 的 2/3 ，也就是 33 。」這是個開始 其他人比較世故一些 消耗大腦多一點運算能力 說：「別人會因 50 而選 33 ， 所以我就選 22 ， 也就是 33 的 2/3 。」 他們多想了一步，也就是兩步"}, {"zh-tw": " That's better. And of course, in principle, you could do three, four or more, but it starts to get very difficult. Just like in language and other domains, we know that it's hard for people to parse very complex sentences with a kind of recursive structure.", "en": " 這更好，當然理論上 你可以多想三步、四步或更多 但是想越多越困難 就像在語言或其他領域 要組織層疊的句子結構很困難"}, {"zh-tw": " This is called a cognitive hierarchy theory, by the way. It's something that I've worked on and a few other people, and it indicates a kind of hierarchy along with some assumptions about how many people stop at different steps and how the steps of thinking are affected by lots of interesting variables and variant people, as we'll see in a minute.", "en": " 順帶一題，這稱為認知層級理論 這是我和一些人研究的東西 這研究用來驗證 思考深度存在階層關係的假設 和哪些有趣變因會影響思考深度 這部份我們等下就會看到"}, {"zh-tw": " A very different theory, a much more popular one, and an older one, due largely to John Nash of \"A Beautiful Mind\" fame, is what's called equilibrium analysis. So if you've ever taken a game theory course at any level, you will have learned a little bit about this.", "en": " 另一個不同的理論也是較為早期、為人熟知的 大部份歸因於約翰．納許的《美麗境界》 稱為均衡分析 如果你曾修過賽局理論的課 你可能都學過一些"}, {"zh-tw": " An equilibrium is a mathematical state in which everybody has figured out exactly what everyone else will do. It is a very useful concept, but behaviorally, it may not exactly explain what people do the first time they play these types of economic games or in situations in the outside world.", "en": " 「均衡」是對每個人都知道 其他人會怎麼做的數學狀態 這是一個有用的概念 但是首次應用在經濟領域 或是其他現實世界的問題時 它卻無法確切解釋人的行為"}, {"zh-tw": " In this case, the equilibrium makes a very bold prediction, which is everyone wants to be below everyone else, therefore they'll play zero. Let's see what happens. This experiment's been done many, many times.", "en": " 在這狀況下「均衡」是一個大膽的假設： 每個人都會想比其他人選的數值低 所以他們都會選 0 讓我們來看結果這是一個被重複多次的實驗"}, {"zh-tw": " Some of the earliest ones were done in the '90s by me and Rosemarie Nagel and others. This is a beautiful data set of 9,000 people who wrote in to three newspapers and magazines that had a contest.", "en": " 我、羅斯瑪麗．納格爾及其它人 在 90 年代進行的早期實驗 這是由 9 千人參加公佈在 3 家報紙和雜誌的競賽後 所蒐集到的資料"}, {"zh-tw": " The contest said, send in your numbers and whoever is close to two-thirds of the average will win a big prize. And as you can see, there's so much data here, you can see the spikes very visibly.", "en": " 競賽問題說：「回傳你所選的數字， 而任何最接近 2/3 平均值的人獲獎」 如你所見，因為資料龐大你可以清楚的看到一些高峰"}, {"zh-tw": " There's a spike at 33. Those are people doing one step. There is another spike visible at 22.", "en": " 在 33 有一個高峰這是只思考一步的人 另外一個高峰是在 22"}, {"zh-tw": " And notice, by the way, that most people pick numbers right around there. They don't necessarily pick exactly 33 and 22.", "en": " 順帶一題多數人選擇 33 和 22 附近的數值 他們不一定只選 33 或 22"}, {"zh-tw": " There's something a little bit noisy around it. But you can see those spikes, and they're there.", "en": " 所以在附近會有一些雜訊 但是你可以看到這些高峰確實存在"}, {"zh-tw": " There's another group of people who seem to have a firm grip on equilibrium analysis, because they're picking zero or one. But they lose, right? Because picking a number that low is actually a bad choice if other people aren't doing equilibrium analysis as well.", "en": " 另外一些人 對均衡理論有深入的瞭解 因為他們選擇 0 或 1 但是他們輸了，對吧？ 因為如果其他人不懂均衡理論 選擇低數值就不是個好策略"}, {"zh-tw": " So they're smart, but poor. Where are these things happening in the brain? One study by Coricelli and Nagel gives a really sharp, interesting answer.", "en": " 所以他們聰明卻也貧窮 那大腦中發生了什麼事呢？ 柯里切利和納格爾的一項研究給了明顯、有趣的答案"}, {"zh-tw": " So they had people play this game while they were being scanned in an fMRI, and two conditions: in some trials, they're told you're playing another person who's playing right now and we're going to match up your behavior at the end and pay you if you win. In the other trials, they're told, you're playing a computer.", "en": " 他們讓一些人玩這遊戲時 同時接受功能型核磁共振（fMRI） 包含兩種狀況：在其中一組 受試者被告知他們是 和遊戲中的人玩而我們最後會比較你們的作為 如果你贏了，就會得到獎勵 另外一組受試者被告知他們是在電腦玩"}, {"zh-tw": " They're just choosing randomly. So what you see here is a subtraction of areas in which there's more brain activity when you're playing people compared to playing the computer.", "en": " 受試者隨機分組 所以你們可以看到 當和對電腦玩的人比較時 對手是人的受試者腦部活化程度較高"}, {"zh-tw": " And you see activity in some regions we've seen today, medial prefrontal cortex, dorsomedial, however, up here, ventromedial prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate, an area that's involved in lots of types of conflict resolution, like if you're playing \"Simon Says,\" and also the right and left temporoparietal junction. And these are all areas which are fairly reliably known to be part of what's called a \"theory of mind\" circuit, or \"mentalizing circuit.\" That is, it's a circuit that's used to imagine what other people might do.", "en": " 從圖上你可以看到一些我們已知的區域 內側額葉皮層，事實上在這裡的是背內側額葉皮層 腹內前側額葉皮層 和像是你在玩「老師說」遊戲時 處理大量衝突解決的前扣帶皮層 以及左右邊的躡頂葉交界區 而這皆我們所熟知的區域 被納入一個名為「心靈原理」迴路 或稱為「心靈迴路」的一部份 這迴路是用來想像別人可能的行動"}, {"zh-tw": " So these were some of the first studies to see this tied in to game theory. What happens with these one- and two-step types? So we classify people by what they picked, and then we look at the difference between playing humans versus playing computers, which brain areas are differentially active.", "en": " 所以這部份早期的研究 和賽局理論有關 但那些「想一步」和「想兩步」的玩家又是如何呢？ 所以我們將受試者依其選擇區分 然後我們再看看 對手是人或電腦 在腦部活化區域層面的不同"}, {"zh-tw": " On the top you see the one-step players. There's almost no difference.", "en": " 上方你可以看到「想一步」的玩家 它們幾乎沒有不同"}, {"zh-tw": " The reason is, they're treating other people like a computer, and the brain is too. The bottom players, you see all the activity in dorsomedial PFC.", "en": " 原因是他們將人視為電腦，所以大腦也就如此反應 你可從下方玩家中看到背內側額葉皮層的活動"}, {"zh-tw": " So we know that those two-step players are doing something differently. Now if you were to step back and say, \"What can we do with this information?\" you might be able to look at brain activity and say, \"This person's going to be a good poker player,\" or, \"This person's socially naive,\" and we might also be able to study things like development of adolescent brains once we have an idea of where this circuitry exists.", "en": " 所以我們知道這些「想兩步」的玩家有些不同 你可能會停下來想想「我們從這些資訊中得到什麼？」 你可能從大腦活動中判斷 「這人會成為撲克牌高手」 或「這人是交際新手」 既然我們知道這個迴路的存在 我們也可以研究一些 像是青少年腦部的發育"}, {"zh-tw": " Okay. Get ready. I'm saving you some brain activity, because you don't need to use your hair detector cells.", "en": " 準備好囉 我為你們準備了些腦力激盪 你們不用擔心想太多會掉頭髮"}, {"zh-tw": " You should use those cells to think carefully about this game. This is a bargaining game.", "en": " 你們應該專注思考這個遊戲 這是個協商遊戲"}, {"zh-tw": " Two players who are being scanned using EEG electrodes are going to bargain over one to six dollars. If they can do it in 10 seconds, they're going to actually earn that money.", "en": " 兩位被接上腦電波圖（EEG） 電極的玩家 正在進行一項由 1 到 6 元的協商 如果在 10 秒內完成，最後就會得到這份金錢"}, {"zh-tw": " If 10 seconds goes by and they haven't made a deal, they get nothing. That's kind of a mistake together.", "en": " 如果未在 10 秒內完成協商，就得不到錢 這是種兩人一起造成的錯誤"}, {"zh-tw": " The twist is that one player, on the left, is informed about how much on each trial there is. They play lots of trials with different amounts each time.", "en": " 不同的地方在於左邊玩家 確實知道每場協商的底價 而他們會重複多次、所包含的金額不同的協商"}, {"zh-tw": " In this case, they know there's four dollars. The uninformed player doesn't know, but they know that the informed player knows.", "en": " 在這個例子中，他們知道是 4 元 而一邊玩家不知道底價 只知到他們的對手知道"}, {"zh-tw": " So the uninformed player's challenge is to say, \"Is this guy really being fair or are they giving me a very low offer in order to get me to think that there's only one or two dollars available to split?\" in which case they might reject it and not come to a deal. So there's some tension here between trying to get the most money but trying to goad the other player into giving you more.", "en": " 所以不知道底價的玩家會質疑 「對方真的很公平 或是他只給我很低的金額 讓我以為我們真的只有 1、2 塊錢可以分 ？」 如此他們可能會拒絕對方，而讓協議流產 所以這包含「想要的到最多的錢」 和「如何促使對手給你更多錢」的衝突"}, {"zh-tw": " And the way they bargain is to point on a number line that goes from zero to six dollars, and they're bargaining over how much the uninformed player gets, and the informed player's going to get the rest. So this is like a management-labor negotiation in which the workers don't know how much profits the privately held company has, right, and they want to maybe hold out for more money, but the company might want to create the impression that there's very little to split: \"I'm giving you the most that I can.\" First some behavior. So a bunch of the subject pairs, they play face to face.", "en": " 他們議價方式是 是從 0 到 6 這條線上指出一點 他們是在協商「不知情玩家」該得多少 而「知情玩家」會得到剩下的 這就好像顧主和勞工的協商 勞工不知道 公司獲利經額的資訊 他們想要得到更多的錢 但是公司會想營造一個假象 就是營收很少而且「我已將能給的部份都給出去了」 首先看看行為，一部份玩家座在長桌上、面對面協商"}, {"zh-tw": " We have some other data where they play across computers. That's an interesting difference, as you might imagine.", "en": " 我們也有一些他們透過電腦協商的數據 你可以想像兩者的差距十分有趣"}, {"zh-tw": " But a bunch of the face-to-face pairs agree to divide the money evenly every single time. Boring. It's just not interesting neurally.", "en": " 長桌上面對面的協商 會同意每次都均分金錢 無聊死了！平均分配並不有趣"}, {"zh-tw": " It's good for them. They make a lot of money. But we're interested in, can we say something about when disagreements occur versus don't occur? So this is the other group of subjects who often disagree.", "en": " 這對他們很好，因為他們拿到很多錢 我們感興趣的是 如何解釋歧見是否發生 這是通常都達不成協議的一組"}, {"zh-tw": " So they have a chance of -- they bicker and disagree and end up with less money. They might be eligible to be on \"Real Housewives,\" the TV show.", "en": " 他們有機會因歧見而爭執 最後得到很少錢 他們協商情景甚至可以改編成實境秀"}, {"zh-tw": " You see on the left, when the amount to divide is one, two or three dollars, they disagree about half the time, and when the amount is four, five, six, they agree quite often. This turns out to be something that's predicted by a very complicated type of game theory you should come to graduate school at CalTech and learn about.", "en": " 你看左側 當配額為 1 到 3 元時 他們約有 50% 會拒絕 而當配額為 4 到 6 元則會接受 這就是我們所預期的 非常複雜的賽局理論 你應該到加州理工的研究所來學學"}, {"zh-tw": " It's a little too complicated to explain right now, but the theory tells you that this shape kind of should occur. Your intuition might tell you that too.", "en": " 現在要解釋這太困難了 但這理論預期會出現這種趨勢 而你的直覺或許也是這樣告訴你"}, {"zh-tw": " Now I'm going to show you the results from the EEG recording. Very complicated. The right brain schematic is the uninformed person, and the left is the informed.", "en": " 現在我要給你們看腦電波圖（EEG）的紀錄 這非常複雜右邊的腦部模型 是代表「不知情玩家」而左邊則是「知情玩家」"}, {"zh-tw": " Remember that we scanned both brains at the same time, so we can ask about time-synced activity in similar or different areas simultaneously, just like if you wanted to study a conversation and you were scanning two people talking to each other and you'd expect common activity in language regions when they're actually kind of listening and communicating. So the arrows connect regions that are active at the same time, and the direction of the arrows flows from the region that's active first in time, and the arrowhead goes to the region that's active later.", "en": " 記得我們是同時監控兩個大腦 所以我們可以探討在相同或相異大腦區域中 在一段時間內的活化狀況 就像你想研究一段對話 你就同時掃描兩個人的腦部活動 而你會預期當他們正在對話時 共同活化的是語言區 所以這個箭頭連接了同時活化的區域 而箭號方向從 最先活化的區位指出去 箭頭部份表示較後期活化的區域"}, {"zh-tw": " So in this case, if you look carefully, most of the arrows flow from right to left. That is, it looks as if the uninformed brain activity is happening first, and then it's followed by activity in the informed brain.", "en": " 在這個例子中，如果你仔細看 大部份的箭號是由右而左 看起來「不知情玩家」的 腦部較先活化 接著才是「知情玩家」"}, {"zh-tw": " And by the way, these were trials where their deals were made. This is from the first two seconds.", "en": " 順帶一提，這是在達成協議的測試中出現的 這是最初兩秒鐘所得到的數據"}, {"zh-tw": " We haven't finished analyzing this data, so we're still peeking in, but the hope is that we can say something in the first couple of seconds about whether they'll make a deal or not, which could be very useful in thinking about avoiding litigation and ugly divorces and things like that. Those are all cases in which a lot of value is lost by delay and strikes.", "en": " 我們還沒完成這部份的分析 所以這只是大概觀察到的狀況 但我們希望從前 1、2 秒鐘 就可以判斷他們是否能達成協議 這可以用在避免協商破裂，而走向進訴訟程序 例如：最後以不愉快的離婚收場 在很多案例中 是因為延誤和罷工而減損的價值"}, {"zh-tw": " Here's the case where the disagreements occur. You can see it looks different than the one before.", "en": " 而這都是因為歧見 你會看到這和前一個例子不同"}, {"zh-tw": " There's a lot more arrows. That means that the brains are synced up more closely in terms of simultaneous activity, and the arrows flow clearly from left to right.", "en": " 上面有很箭號 這表示大腦正在同步運作 更確切的說是同時間的活動 而箭號由左指向右"}, {"zh-tw": " That is, the informed brain seems to be deciding, \"We're probably not going to make a deal here.\" And then later there's activity in the uninformed brain. Next I'm going to introduce you to some relatives.", "en": " 這好像是「知情玩家」的大腦開使思考 「這個可能是失敗的協商」的訊號 後來這個活化模式也出現在「不知情玩家」 接著讓我來介紹我們的近親"}, {"zh-tw": " They're hairy, smelly, fast and strong. You might be thinking back to your last Thanksgiving.", "en": " 牠們多毛、體味重、迅捷和強壯 你可能會想到你上個感恩節的裝扮"}, {"zh-tw": " Maybe if you had a chimpanzee with you. Charles Darwin and I and you broke off from the family tree from chimpanzees about five million years ago.", "en": " 如果你帶了知黑猩猩的話 查理．達爾文、你和我在 50 萬年前 從演化樹上和黑猩猩分開"}, {"zh-tw": " They're still our closest genetic kin. We share 98.8 percent of the genes.", "en": " 遺傳上，是牠們仍是最接近我們的親戚 我們之間有 98.8 % 相同的基因"}, {"zh-tw": " We share more genes with them than zebras do with horses. And we're also their closest cousin.", "en": " 我們之間的共同基因比斑馬和野馬間多的多 我們也是牠們最接近的親戚"}, {"zh-tw": " They have more genetic relation to us than to gorillas. So how humans and chimpanzees behave differently might tell us a lot about brain evolution.", "en": " 牠們和我們的基因相似度比和大猩猩更接近 所以人類和黑猩猩行為的不同 可能提供我們瞭解腦部演化的線索"}, {"zh-tw": " So this is an amazing memory test from Nagoya, Japan, Primate Research Institute, where they've done a lot of this research. This goes back quite a ways. They're interested in working memory.", "en": " 這是日本名古屋靈長類研究中心 一個令人驚歎的記憶測試 他們在那裡做了很多類似的研究 這已經是早期的研究，他們對記憶形成很有興趣"}, {"zh-tw": " The chimp is going to see, watch carefully, they're going to see 200 milliseconds' exposure — that's fast, that's eight movie frames — of numbers one, two, three, four, five.

This is a young chimp. The young ones are better than the old ones, just like humans.", "en": " 讓我們看看牠們表現如何 這是隻年輕的黑猩猩 像人類一樣年輕的表現比年老的好"}, {"zh-tw": " And they're highly experienced, so they've done this thousands and thousands of time. Obviously there's a big training effect, as you can imagine.", "en": " 而且牠們已經做了幾千次了 可以說是駕輕就熟 你可以想像有很大一部份歸於訓練"}, {"zh-tw": " You can see they're very blasé and kind of effortless. Not only can they do it very well, they do it in a sort of lazy way.", "en": " 你可以看到牠們已經呈現玩膩時倦怠 他們不只做的很好而且是用一種慵懶的方式完成"}, {"zh-tw": " Right? Who thinks you could beat the chimps? Wrong. We can try. We'll try. Maybe we'll try.", "en": " 對嗎？誰認為自己可以打敗這些猩猩呢？ 錯了 我們可以嘗試或許我們真的會試試"}, {"zh-tw": " Okay, so the next part of this study I'm going to go quickly through is based on an idea of Tetsuro Matsuzawa. He had a bold idea that -- what he called the cognitive trade-off hypothesis.", "en": " 好的，這研究的另一部份 我會很快的帶過 這是基於松澤綱野的想法 他有一個想法稱為認知妥協假說"}, {"zh-tw": " We know chimps are faster and stronger. They're also very obsessed with status.", "en": " 我們知道猩猩迅捷且強壯 牠們也對自身狀況非常執著"}, {"zh-tw": " His thought was, maybe they've preserved brain activities and they practice them in development that are really, really important to them to negotiate status and to win, which is something like strategic thinking during competition. So we're going to check that out by having the chimps actually play a game by touching two touch screens.", "en": " 他認為，或許黑猩猩保留了 對牠們非常重要 用來協商條件和獲勝的腦部活動 並在成長過程中練習 這就像是在競爭中的策略思考 所以我們接著就去證實它 藉由讓黑猩猩玩個遊戲 藉由點擊兩個觸控螢幕"}, {"zh-tw": " The chimps are actually interacting with each other through the computers. They're going to press left or right.", "en": " 猩猩真的可以借由電腦互相交流 他們可以選擇按「左」或「右」"}, {"zh-tw": " One chimp is called a matcher.
