And suicide doesn't even fit into thisin a very logical way.", "en": " 然而從政府的檔案中，我們看到有一半的軍人 正在領取創傷後壓力症候群的救濟金。 從邏輯看來，自殺人數根本不符合這個數據。"}, {"zh-tw": " We've all heard the tragic statisticof 22 vets a day, on average, in this country, killing themselves.

And maybe what determines the rate of long-term PTSD isn't what happened out there, but the kind of society you come back to.", "en": " 當他們的戰士從抵抗美國軍隊的戰爭中回到家鄉 或者從互相攻擊的戰爭中回來， 我猜他們肯定很容易就重新融入部落生活。 也許 決定長期創傷後壓力症的因素 不是在戰場上發生了什麼， 而是你回到了什麼樣的社會。"}, {"zh-tw": " And maybe if you come backto a close, cohesive, tribal society, you can get over trauma pretty quickly. And if you come backto an alienating, modern society, you might remain traumatizedyour entire life.", "en": " 也許假如你回到一個緊密聯繫的、團結的、部落化的社會， 你很快就能從精神創傷中康復。 但假如你回到一個人與人疏遠的現代的社會， 你可能在以後的一輩子都遭受精神創傷。"}, {"zh-tw": " In other words, maybe the problemisn't them, the vets; maybe the problem is us. Certainly, modern societyis hard on the human psyche by every metric that we have.", "en": " 也就是說，也許問題不在於退伍軍人本身； 而在於社會上的我們。 的確，現代社會對人類的精神帶來了重大的壓力， 這些壓力來自於我們社會上各種的衡量標準。"}, {"zh-tw": " As wealth goes up in a society, the suicide rate goes up instead of down. If you live in modern society, you're up to eight times more likely to suffer from depression in your lifetime than if you live in a poor,agrarian society.", "en": " 隨著社會財富的積累， 自殺率上升而不是下降。 假如你生活在現代社會， 你患上抑鬱症的可能性 相比於你在貧窮的農業社會生活要高八倍。"}, {"zh-tw": " Modern society has probably producedthe highest rates of suicide and depression and anxietyand loneliness and child abuse ever in human history. I saw one study that compared women in Nigeria, one of the most chaoticand violent and corrupt and poorest countries in Africa, to women in North America.", "en": " 現代社會也許產生了最高的自殺率 抑鬱症、焦慮症、孤僻症和受到童年虐待的可能， 這比例要比歷史任一時代都高。 我看過一個研究， 它把奈吉利亞的婦女， 也就是非洲最混亂、最暴力、最腐敗 最貧窮的國家之一， 和北美的女性進行比較。"}, {"zh-tw": " And the highest rates of depressionwere urban women in North America. That was also the wealthiest group.", "en": " 北美的城市女性是憂鬱症患病率最高的。 她們也是最富裕的群體。"}, {"zh-tw": " So let's go back to the US military. Ten percent are in combat.", "en": " 我們回頭來看美軍的狀況。 10% 的軍人經歷過戰爭。"}, {"zh-tw": " Around 50 percent have filedfor PTSD compensation. So about 40 percent of veteransreally were not traumatized overseas but have come home to discoverthey are dangerously alienated and depressed.", "en": " 這裡面有將近 50% 的軍人登記在案，領取創傷後壓力症候群的補償。 所以大概 40% 的退休軍人並不是在海外受到精神創傷， 而是回到家後發現他們被孤立 並感到沮喪絕望。"}, {"zh-tw": " So what is happening with them? What's going on with those people, the phantom 40 percent that are troubledbut don't understand why? Maybe it's this: maybe they had an experienceof sort of tribal closeness in their unit when they were overseas. They were eating together,sleeping together, doing tasks and missions together.", "en": " 那麼他們遭遇了什麼？ 在他們身上究竟發生了什麼， 我們讓 40% 的人，患上創傷後壓力症，卻不清楚成因？ 也許是這樣的： 也許當時他們在海外， 經歷過部隊親密的戰友關係。 他們一起吃飯，一起睡覺， 一起完成任務。"}, {"zh-tw": " They were trusting each otherwith their lives. And then they come home and they have to give all that up and they're coming backto a society, a modern society, which is hard on peoplewho weren't even in the military.", "en": " 他們以生命維護彼此的信任。 當他們回到家， 他們必須捨棄戰場上的所有情誼， 他們回到社會，這個現代社會， 這個即使沒有入過伍的人都覺得艱難的社會。"}, {"zh-tw": " It's just hard on everybody. And we keep focusing on trauma, PTSD.", "en": " 所有人在這社會都活得艱苦。 而我們卻一直關注精神創傷、創傷後壓力症，"}, {"zh-tw": " But for a lot of these people, maybe it's not trauma. I mean, certainly,soldiers are traumatized and the ones who arehave to be treated for that.", "en": " 但對大部分人來說， 也許這不是精神創傷。 我的意思是，士兵的確是受過精神創傷， 也有士兵接受過治療。"}, {"zh-tw": " But a lot of them -- maybe what's bothering themis actually a kind of alienation. I mean, maybe we just havethe wrong word for some of it, and just changing our language,our understanding, would help a little bit.", "en": " 但他們中的很多人—— 也許困擾他們的只是一種隔離感。 我的意思是，也許我們只是錯用了詞語去形容他們， 只要改變我們的語言、我們的認知， 就能幫助改變現狀。"}, {"zh-tw": " \"Post-deployment alienation disorder.\" Maybe even just calling it thatfor some of these people would allow them to stop imagining trying to imagine a traumathat didn't really happen in order to explain a feelingthat really is happening. And in fact, it's an extremelydangerous feeling.", "en": " 「 戰後孤獨感症候群 」 也許只要這樣稱呼他們其中的一部分人， 就能幫助他們停止聯想 一個根本沒有發生過的創傷， 這是為了解釋一種他們正在經歷的感受。 而事實上，這是一種非常危險的感覺。"}, {"zh-tw": " That alienation and depressioncan lead to suicide. These people are in danger.", "en": " 隔離感和抑鬱會導致自殺。 這些人正處於危險中。"}, {"zh-tw": " It's very important to understand why. The Israeli military has a PTSD rateof around one percent.", "en": " 瞭解成因是非常重要的事情。 以色列軍隊的創傷後壓力症比例在1%左右。"}, {"zh-tw": " The theory is that everyone in Israelis supposed to serve in the military. When soldiers come backfrom the front line, they're not going from a militaryenvironment to a civilian environment.", "en": " 有一種理論是說，因為以色列的所有人都需要服兵役。 當軍人從前線回來， 他們不是要從軍隊環境回到文明社會，"}, {"zh-tw": " They're coming back to a communitywhere everyone understands about the military. Everyone's been in itor is going to be in it.", "en": " 而是回到一個 人人都瞭解甚麼是當兵的社會。 每個人都曾經服役、或者準備去服役。"}, {"zh-tw": " Everyone understandsthe situation they're all in. It's as if they're all in one big tribe.", "en": " 每個人都瞭解他們處於的環境， 就像他們都處於一個大部落。"}, {"zh-tw": " We know that if you take a lab rat and traumatize it and put itin a cage by itself, you can maintain its trauma symptomsalmost indefinitely. And if you take that same lab ratand put it in a cage with other rats, after a couple of weeks,it's pretty much OK.", "en": " 我們知道假如你用一隻實驗鼠， 讓它受到精神創傷，再把它獨自放在籠子里， 你可以永無止境地讓牠保持在精神創傷的狀態。 但假如你把同樣的實驗鼠放在有其他老鼠的籠子里， 幾個星期後，牠的表現就會回復正常了。"}, {"zh-tw": " After 9/11, the murder rate in New York Citywent down by 40 percent.

We come together. We unify.", "en": " 原因是，假如你讓整個社會受到精神創傷， 我們不會瓦解崩潰並和別人針鋒相對。 我們會團結起來。"}, {"zh-tw": " Basically, we tribalize, and that process of unifyingfeels so good and is so good for us, that it even helps people who are strugglingwith mental health issues. During the blitz in London, admissions to psychiatric wardswent down during the bombings.", "en": " 從根本上說，我們部落化了， 團結一起的過程讓人感覺很好，也對我們有益， 而且它甚至可以幫助那些 正在精神障礙中掙扎的人們。 在二戰倫敦被德國轟炸的期間， 精神病醫院的患者減少了。"}, {"zh-tw": " For a while, that was the kind of country that American soldiers cameback to -- a unified country. We were sticking together.", "en": " 有一段時間，美軍從海外返回的國家 是一個團結的國家。 我們團結在一起。"}, {"zh-tw": " We were trying to understandthe threat against us. We were trying to helpourselves and the world.", "en": " 我們嘗試去瞭解我們面對的威脅。 我們嘗試去幫助自己以至於整個世界。"}, {"zh-tw": " But that's changed. Now, American soldiers, American veterans are coming backto a country that is so bitterly divided that the two political partiesare literally accusing each other of treason, of beingan enemy of the state, of trying to undermine the securityand the welfare of their own country.", "en": " 但情況改變了。 現在美軍， 美國的退伍軍人正在回到一個極其分裂的國家， 兩黨互相指控對方叛國、 是國家的敵人、 或者暗中顛覆國家的國土安全和福利。"}, {"zh-tw": " The gap between rich and pooris the biggest it's ever been. It's just getting worse.", "en": " 貧富差距是有史以來最大的。 現狀還在惡化。"}, {"zh-tw": " Race relations are terrible. There are demonstrationsand even riots in the streets because of racial injustice.", "en": " 族群關係也很糟糕。 因為種族的不平等， 街上有抗議活動，甚至暴亂。"}, {"zh-tw": " And veterans know that any tribethat treated itself that way -- in fact, any platoon that treated itselfthat way -- would never survive. We've gotten used to it.", "en": " 退伍軍人知道任何一個部落或者連隊 以這樣的方式對待自己的戰友，都不會存活。 我們卻已經習慣了。"}, {"zh-tw": " Veterans have gone awayand are coming back and seeing their own countrywith fresh eyes.

Sometimes, we ask ourselvesif we can save the vets.", "en": " 難怪他們會害怕。 有時我們問自己我們能不能拯救退伍軍人。"}, {"zh-tw": " I think the real questionis if we can save ourselves. If we can, I think the vets are going to be fine.", "en": " 我覺得真正的問題在於我們能不能拯救自己。 假如我們可以， 那麼我覺得退伍軍人就能康復。"}, {"zh-tw": " It's time for this country to unite, if only to help the men and womenwho fought to protect us.
