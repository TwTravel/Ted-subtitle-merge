I was two years olderthan my sister at the time -- I mean, I'm two yearsolder than her now -- but at the time it meant she had to doeverything that I wanted to do, and I wanted to play war.", "en": " 在我七歲，我妹妹才五歲時 有一天我們在雙層床的上舖玩 那時候我比我妹妹大兩歲 -- 我想，我現在還是比她大兩歲 -- 也就是說在當時她要跟著我做我想做的事 而我想玩打仗"}, {"zh-tw": " So we were up on top of our bunk beds. And on one side of the bunk bed, I had put out all of my G.I. Joesoldiers and weaponry.", "en": " 所以我們爬到上舖 在雙層床的這一邊 放著我所有的特種部隊士兵及武器"}, {"zh-tw": " And on the other side wereall my sister's My Little Ponies ready for a cavalry charge. There are differing accountsof what actually happened that afternoon, but since my sister is nothere with us today, let me tell you the true story -- which is my sister's a littleon the clumsy side.", "en": " 在另一邊則是我妹妹的各式彩虹小馬 準備好要衝鋒陷陣 那天下午到底發生了什麼事其實是各說各話 但是既然我妹妹不在場 就讓我告訴你真實的情況 當時我妹妹正節節敗退"}, {"zh-tw": " Somehow, without any help or pushfrom her older brother at all, Amy disappearedoff of the top of the bunk bed and landed with this crash on the floor. I nervously peeredover the side of the bed to see what had befallen my fallen sister and saw that she had landedpainfully on her hands and knees on all fours on the ground.", "en": " 不知為何，她哥哥我既沒幫她也沒有推她 愛咪突然就從上舖消失了 砰的一聲摔在地板上 我很緊張的探頭往下看 到底是什麼東西讓我妹妹成了墜落天使 我看到我妹妹趴在地上，五體投地的樣子 痛的不得了"}, {"zh-tw": " I was nervous becausemy parents had charged me with making sure that my sister and I played as safelyand as quietly as possible. And seeing as how I hadaccidentally broken Amy's arm just one week before -- (Laughter ends) heroically pushing her out of the wayof an oncoming imaginary sniper bullet, for which I have yet to be thanked,I was trying as hard as I could -- she didn't even see it coming -- I was trying hardto be on my best behavior.", "en": " 我好緊張，因為我的父母才命令我 一定要確保我妹妹及我 在玩耍時盡量保持安全、安靜 因為我上星期才不小心 摔斷了愛咪的手臂 ... ... 因為我耍英雄把她推開 為了要閃一顆想像的狙擊手子彈 她還沒為這件事道謝過 我盡全力 -- 她根本沒看到那顆子彈 -- 我盡全力要當乖小孩"}, {"zh-tw": " And I saw my sister's face, this wail of painand suffering and surprise threatening to erupt from her mouthand wake my parents from the long winter's napfor which they had settled. So I did the only thing my frantic seven year-old braincould think to do to avert this tragedy.", "en": " 所以我看到我妹妹 又驚又痛哭喪著臉 威脅著要嚎啕大哭，把爸媽 從深冬的午睡吵醒，他們才剛剛睡著 所以我試圖用我慌亂的七歲小腦袋 能想到的唯一方法來扭轉情勢"}, {"zh-tw": " And if you have children,you've seen this hundreds of times. I said, \"Amy, wait. Don't cry.Did you see how you landed? No human lands on all fours like that.", "en": " 如果你有孩子，你一定看過幾百次這種場面 我說：「愛咪，愛咪，等等，不哭，不哭， 妳知道妳怎麼著地的嗎？ 沒有人是四腳著地的喔！"}, {"zh-tw": " Amy, I think this means you're a unicorn.\" Now, that was cheating, because there was nothingshe would want more than not to be Amythe hurt five year-old little sister, but Amy the special unicorn. Of course, this optionwas open to her brain at no point in the past.", "en": " 愛咪，我想你一定是獨角獸。」 那當然是哄騙，因為在這世界上我妹妹 絕不想做痛痛的五歲小妹妹愛咪 寧願當特別的獨角獸愛咪 當然，之前她從沒想過這個選擇"}, {"zh-tw": " And you could see how my poor,manipulated sister faced conflict, as her little brain attemptedto devote resources to feeling the pain and sufferingand surprise she just experienced, or contemplating her new-foundidentity as a unicorn. And the latter won.", "en": " 然後你想像一下我可憐又被耍了的妹妹一臉掙扎 她的小腦袋一方面要處理 她剛剛才經歷的 疼痛與驚嚇 又要思索著她剛剛才發現的獨角獸新身分 而後者贏了"}, {"zh-tw": " Instead of crying or ceasing our play, instead of waking my parents, with all the negative consequences for me, a smile spread across her face and she scrambled back uponto the bunk bed with all the grace of a baby unicorn -- with one broken leg. What we stumbled across at this tender ageof just five and seven -- we had no idea at the time -- was was going be at the vanguardof a scientific revolution occurring two decades later in the waythat we look at the human brain.", "en": " 所以她不但沒哭，沒有停止玩耍 也沒有吵醒我的父母 所有可能發生在我身上的負面後果都沒有發生 反而臉上展開微笑 然後以小獨角獸的翩翩姿態爬回雙層床去 ... ... 用她摔斷的腿 在我們五歲及七歲這樣的稚齡 所經歷到的這個偶發事件 -- 我們那時並不了解 -- 其實是科學革命的先鋒 二十年後人類的確以這種方法探討腦部"}, {"zh-tw": " We had stumbled acrosssomething called positive psychology, which is the reason I'm here today and the reason that I wake upevery morning. When I started talking about this research outside of academia,with companies and schools, the first thing they said to never dois to start with a graph.", "en": " 這個偶然的經歷被稱作正向心理學 這是我今天站在這裡的原因 也是我每天早上能醒來的原因 當我第一次對著非學術機構 就是對公司及學校談論這個研究主題時 大家都說絕對不要 一開始就分析圖表"}, {"zh-tw": " The first thing I want to dois start with a graph. This graph looks boring, but it is the reason I get excitedand wake up every morning.", "en": " 但我還是要從一張圖表開始這個主題 這張圖看起來很枯燥乏味 但這張圖正是我每天早上能興奮的起床的原因"}, {"zh-tw": " And this graph doesn't even meananything; it's fake data. What we found is -- If I got this data studying you,I would be thrilled, because there's a trend there, and that means that I can get published, which is all that really matters.", "en": " 這張表沒有任何意義；上面的數據是假的 我們發現 -- 如果這張圖是我研究在場各位的結果，我會很激動 因為這張圖的趨勢非常明顯 代表著我可以發表這個研究結果 而發表結果是我做研究最主要的原因"}, {"zh-tw": " There is one weird red dotabove the curve, there's one weirdo in the room -- I know who you are, I saw you earlier -- that's no problem. That's no problem, as most of you know,because I can just delete that dot.", "en": " 但有一個怪怪的小紅點在曲線的上方 也就是說這個講座裡有個怪胎 -- 我知道你是誰，我剛剛看到你了 -- 但沒關係 真的沒關係，大部份的人都知道這不影響 因為我只要把這個點刪去就好"}, {"zh-tw": " I can delete that dot becausethat's clearly a measurement error. And we know that's a measurement errorbecause it's messing up my data.", "en": " 我可以刪掉它，很明顯它是個測量偏誤 它會被判讀是個測量偏誤 歸因於它讓我的數據很難看"}, {"zh-tw": " So one of the first things we teach people in economics, statistics,business and psychology courses is how, in a statistically valid way,do we eliminate the weirdos. How do we eliminate the outliersso we can find the line of best fit? Which is fantasticif I'm trying to find out how many Advil the averageperson should be taking -- two.", "en": " 所以在經濟學、統計學、商業學 及心理學課程裡我們教大家的第一件事 就是如何在統計容許範圍內把怪怪的數據刪掉 如何刪去範圍外的數據 讓我們找到一條最好的曲線？ 這個方法非常神奇因為我能藉此方法研究得知 一個人吃Advil止痛藥的劑量是兩顆為最佳"}, {"zh-tw": " But if I'm interested in your potential, or for happiness or productivityor energy or creativity, we're creating the cultof the average with science. If I asked a question like, \"How fast can a child learnhow to read in a classroom?\" scientists change the answer to \"How fast does the average childlearn how to read in that classroom?\" and we tailor the classtowards the average.", "en": " 但如果我想研究的是人的潛力 或是幸福程度、生產力、 活力、創造力 這種科學方法創造出我們對平均數的一種迷思 如果我想研究： 「在課堂裡，一個學童多快可以學會閱讀？」 科學家會把問題改成「在課堂裡，平均一個學童 多快可以學會閱讀？」 然後我們會盡力研究出一個平均值 如果你的學習速度在平均數以下"}, {"zh-tw": " If you fall below the average, then psychologists get thrilled, because that means you'redepressed or have a disorder, or hopefully both. We're hoping for bothbecause our business model is, if you come into a therapysession with one problem, we want to make sure youleave knowing you have ten, so you keep coming back.", "en": " 心理學家會很興奮 因為那意味著，你要麼患有憂鬱症，或是某種障礙 或最好是兩者都有 我們希望看到兩者都有因為我們的商業模式是 如果你因為某種問題去找心理師治療 我們確定你離開的時候知道自己的病情非常嚴重 這樣你才會一直回診"}, {"zh-tw": " We'll go back into yourchildhood if necessary, but eventually we wantto make you normal again. But normal is merely average.", "en": " 如果有必要，我們會追溯到你的童年， 不過最終目的，是要讓你再恢復正常 但所謂的正常，就是回到平均值"}, {"zh-tw": " And positive psychology positsthat if we study what is merely average, we will remain merely average. Then instead of deletingthose positive outliers, what I intentionally do is comeinto a population like this one and say, why? Why are some of you high above the curve in terms of intellectual,athletic, musical ability, creativity, energy levels, resiliency in the faceof challenge, sense of humor? Whatever it is, instead of deletingyou, what I want to do is study you.", "en": " 而從正向心理學的角度來看 如果我們一直研究平均現象 我們就會一直維持在平均現象裡 所以我沒有刪去那些平均線上方的值 我盡量在取樣時找平均線之上的人 而且問為什麼？ 為什麼有些人他們的 智力、運動力、音感 創造力、活動力 面對挑戰的恢復力、甚至幽默感都能遠高於一般平均？ 不管這人在哪一方面很強我就想研究這種人，而不是刪去這個數據 因為也許我們可以從這些數據中發現一些東西"}, {"zh-tw": " Because maybe we can glean information, not just how to movepeople up to the average, but move the entire average upin our companies and schools worldwide. The reason this graph is important to me is, on the news, the majorityof the information is not positive.", "en": " 我們應該想，該如何把人往平均值以上推升 甚至該想，要如何把全球的 學校或企業都往上提高一個檔次。 這張圖對我之所以很重要 是因為當我打開電視看新聞，似乎大部份的資訊 都不是正面的報導，實際是負面居多"}, {"zh-tw": " in fact it's negative. Most of it's about murder, corruption,diseases, natural disasters.", "en": " 大多在報謀殺、貪腐、疾病、天災"}, {"zh-tw": " And very quickly, my brain starts to think that's the accurate ratioof negative to positive in the world. This creates\"the medical school syndrome.\" During the first year of medical training, as you read through a list of allthe symptoms and diseases, suddenly you realize you have all of them.", "en": " 很快地，我的腦袋就會認為 這就是目前世界上負面與正面事件的比例 這種現象就是 所謂醫學院症候群 就是如果你認識在讀醫學院的人 通常在他們實習的第一年 讀遍了所有醫學症狀及疾病的清單後 會突然發現自己每個症狀都有"}, {"zh-tw": " I have a brother in-law named Bobo,which is a whole other story. Bobo married Amy the unicorn.", "en": " 我的妹夫名叫布波–這個名字的來源可以另外講一個故事 布波娶了我的獨角獸妹妹愛咪"}, {"zh-tw": " Bobo called me on the phone -- from Yale Medical School, and Bobo said, \"Shawn, I have leprosy.\" Which, even at Yale,is extraordinarily rare. But I had no idea how to console poor Bobo because he had just gottenover an entire week of menopause.", "en": " 有一天布波從耶魯的醫學院 打電話給我 布波說：「紹恩，我得了痲瘋病。」 這個病在耶魯也很罕見 但是我真不知道要怎麼安慰布波 因為他才從一整個星期的停經症狀中恢復過來"}, {"zh-tw": " We're finding it's not necessarilythe reality that shapes us, but the lens through which your brainviews the world that shapes your reality. And if we can change the lens,not only can we change your happiness, we can change every single educationaland business outcome at the same time.", "en": " 我們發現，我們並不盡然由事實所塑造 塑造我們的其實是那副「你的腦子如何看世界」的鏡片 如果我們能換掉這個鏡片我們不但能對快樂的定義改觀 同時我們還可以改變每一個學校及企業的績效 當我申請哈佛就讀時，我其實是冒險一試"}, {"zh-tw": " I applied to Harvard on a dare. I didn't expect to get in, and my familyhad no money for college.", "en": " 我不期望他們會接受我我家也沒錢讓我讀大學 直到二個星期後我得到了軍方的獎學金，他們就讓我去了"}, {"zh-tw": " When I got a military scholarshiptwo weeks later, they let me go. Something that wasn'teven a possibility became a reality.", "en": " 突然，一件原本不可能的事成真了 當我入學時，我以為我的同學都會把能進哈佛當成殊榮"}, {"zh-tw": " I assumed everyone therewould see it as a privilege as well, that they'd be excited to be there. Even in a classroomfull of people smarter than you, I felt you'd be happy just to bein that classroom.", "en": " 他們應該會很高興能入學 即使你整班的同學都比你聰明 你都該為了能在這個班而高興至少我是這麼覺得的 但是我發現 雖然有些人的確這麼想"}, {"zh-tw": " But what I found is,while some people experience that, when I graduated after my four years and then spent the next eight yearsliving in the dorms with the students -- Harvard asked me to; I wasn't that guy. I was an officer to counsel studentsthrough the difficult four years.", "en": " 四年後當我大學畢業 然後又花了八年的時間跟學生們住在宿舍 -- 是哈佛要我住的；我不是那個郵包炸彈客 哈佛聘雇我當指導老師幫助學生度過這困難的四年"}, {"zh-tw": " And in my research and my teaching, I found that these students,no matter how happy they were with their original successof getting into the school, two weeks later their brains were focused,not on the privilege of being there, nor on their philosophy or physics, but on the competition, the workload, the hassles, stresses, complaints. When I first went in there, I walkedinto the freshmen dining hall, which is where my friends from Waco,Texas, which is where I grew up -- I know some of you know this.", "en": " 我在我的研究及教學中發現 不管這些學生原本 對能成功入學這件事有多高興 入學二個星期後他們腦子專注的事既不是這件殊榮 也不是哲學課或物理課 他們的腦子專注於競爭、工作量 麻煩、壓力、抱怨 當我第一次到那裡我走進大一宿舍的餐廳 那時從我老家德州維克市來的朋友們--- 也許有些人聽過這事 他們到餐廳來找我，並環顧著餐廳"}, {"zh-tw": " When they'd visit, they'd look around, and say, \"This dining hall looks likesomething out of Hogwart's.\" It does, because that was Hogwart'sand that's Harvard. And when they see this, they say, \"Why do you waste your timestudying happiness at Harvard? What does a Harvard studentpossibly have to be unhappy about?\" Embedded within that question is the key to understandingthe science of happiness.", "en": " 他們說：「這個大一餐廳看起來好像 電影哈利波特的霍格華茲。」的確如此。 這是電影哈利波特的霍格華茲，而這是哈佛 我的朋友看看這個地方 都說，「紹恩，你為什麼要在哈佛浪費時間研究快樂？ 說真的，有什麼事會讓這些哈佛學生 不快樂啊？」 這個問題隱藏著 瞭解快樂這門科學的關鍵 因為這個問題預設了某個前提"}, {"zh-tw": " Because what that question assumes is that our external worldis predictive of our happiness levels, when in reality, if I know everythingabout your external world, I can only predict 10%of your long-term happiness. 90 percent of your long-term happinessis predicted not by the external world, but by the way your brainprocesses the world.", "en": " 就是我們幸福的程度可以由我們的外在環境來預測 可是事實是，就算我知道你外在環境的一切 我也只能預測你10%的長期幸福程度 另外的90% 不能以外在環境預測 是取決於你的腦子如何看待這個環境 如果我們改變它"}, {"zh-tw": " And if we change it, if we change our formulafor happiness and success, we can change the waythat we can then affect reality. What we found is that only 25%of job successes are predicted by IQ, 75 percent of job successes are predicted by your optimismlevels, your social support and your ability to see stressas a challenge instead of as a threat.", "en": " 如果我們改變幸福及成功的公式 改變思考方式 就可以改變現實 我們發現只有25%的工作成就 可以用智商來預測 另外要預測75%的工作成就 就看你的樂觀程度，你的社交圈 還有你能不能把壓力當作挑戰，而不是威脅"}, {"zh-tw": " I talked to a New England boarding school,probably the most prestigious one, and they said, \"We already know that. So every year, instead of just teachingour students, we have a wellness week.", "en": " 我跟新英格蘭州的一間寄宿學校談過這所學校大概是最有名的寄宿學校 他們說：「我們早就知道了 所以每年我們除了教學外，還有一個健康周活動"}, {"zh-tw": " And we're so excited.

Thursday night is illicit drug use.", "en": " 星期四晚上談毒品誘惑"}, {"zh-tw": " And Friday night we're trying to decidebetween risky sex or happiness.\" I said, \"That's most people'sFriday nights.\" Which I'm glad you liked,but they did not like that at all. Silence on the phone.", "en": " 星期五晚上討論危險性行為與快樂的抉擇。」 我說：「大部份人的星期五晚上都是這樣的。」 （鼓掌） 我很高興你們喜歡這個笑話，但是他們不喜歡 電話的那一頭默不作聲"}, {"zh-tw": " And into the silence, I said,\"I'd be happy to speak at your school, but that's not a wellness week,that's a sickness week. You've outlined all the negativethings that can happen, but not talked about the positive.\" The absence of disease is not health.", "en": " 為了打破僵局，我說：「我很高興能在你的學校演講 不過你知道，那不是健康週，那簡直是疾病週 你所做的其實是強調所有可能發生的負面東西 但是都沒有提到正向的東西。」 沒有病並不代表健康 以下是我們得到健康的方法"}, {"zh-tw": " Here's how we get to health: We need to reverse the formulafor happiness and success. In the last three years,I've traveled to 45 countries, working with schools and companiesin the midst of an economic downturn.", "en": " 我們必須把幸福及成功的公式反過來寫 過去三年，經濟正不景氣的時候 我到過45個不同的國家 跟學校及公司合作"}, {"zh-tw": " And I found thatmost companies and schools follow a formulafor success, which is this: If I work harder, I'll be more successful. And if I'm more successful,then I'll be happier.", "en": " 我發現大部份的公司及學校 都遵照一個成功公式，就是 如果我更努力工作，我就會更成功 如果我更成功，我就會更快樂"}, {"zh-tw": " That undergirds mostof our parenting and managing styles, the way that we motivate our behavior. And the problem is it's scientificallybroken and backwards for two reasons.", "en": " 這是我們的教養態度及管理模式的根本 是我們激勵自己表現更好的方法 問題是，這不合科學且倒行逆施，兩個理由 第一，你的腦子每經歷一次成功"}, {"zh-tw": " Every time your brain has a success, you just changed the goalpostof what success looked like. You got good grades,now you have to get better grades, you got into a good schooland after you get into a better one, you got a good job,now you have to get a better job, you hit your sales target,we're going to change it.", "en": " 你就把你期望的成功目標更改一次 你過去成績不錯，現在你要更好 你進了一所好學校，下一所學校就要更好 你得了一個好工作，下一個工作要更好 你銷售成績亮點，我們就要提高你的銷售額目標 如果幸福快樂是在成功的另一端你的腦子永遠得不到這個感覺"}, {"zh-tw": " And if happiness is on the opposite sideof success, your brain never gets there. We've pushed happinessover the cognitive horizon, as a society.", "en": " 我們的社會集體意識，把幸福快樂 推到認知水平線的另一端 因為我們以為必須先成功"}, {"zh-tw": " And that's because we thinkwe have to be successful, then we'll be happier. But our brains work in the opposite order.", "en": " 才會比較幸福 但其實我們的腦子是以相反的方式在運作的 如果你可以提升一個人目前的積極程度"}, {"zh-tw": " If you can raise somebody's levelof positivity in the present, then their brain experiences what we nowcall a happiness advantage, which is your brain at positiveperforms significantly better than at negative, neutral or stressed. Your intelligence rises, your creativityrises, your energy levels rise.", "en": " 那麼他的腦子會經歷我們稱之為\"快樂優勢\"的感覺 就是當你的腦部處於積極狀態 會比消極時、中立時或者處在壓力時 顯著表現更好 你的理解力提升，你的創造力增加，你的活動力也升高 事實上我們發現"}, {"zh-tw": " In fact, we've found that every singlebusiness outcome improves. Your brain at positiveis 31% more productive than your brain at negative,neutral or stressed.", "en": " 每一種業務成效都進步了 你的創造力在你的腦部處於積極狀態時， 會比處於消極、中立，或者有壓力時，提高31% 銷售量提高37%"}, {"zh-tw": " You're 37% better at sales.

If we can find a way of becomingpositive in the present, then our brains workeven more successfully as we're able to work harder,faster and more intelligently.", "en": " 如果我們可以找到讓當下就很積極的方法 那麼我們的腦子就會更靈活 我們就可以更努力、更快的工作，而且更明智"}, {"zh-tw": " We need to be able to reverse this formula so we can start to see what our brainsare actually capable of. Because dopamine, which floodsinto your system when you're positive, has two functions.", "en": " 我們需要想辦法把公式反過來寫 我們才能開始想像我們的腦子到底能做到什麼地步 因為在你感覺積極時多巴胺會大量湧入你的身體裡 而多巴胺有兩種功能 它不但讓你感覺更快樂"}, {"zh-tw": " Not only does it make you happier, it turns on all of the learningcenters in your brain allowing you to adaptto the world in a different way.
