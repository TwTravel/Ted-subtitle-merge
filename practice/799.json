Now, I have a plan for this, and it entails convincing more people, including all of you, to spend more timeplaying bigger and better games.", "en": " 我叫Jane McGonigal。我是個遊戲設計師。 我從事線上遊戲製作十年了。 而我未來十年的目標 是試著讓 拯救現實世界 變得跟拯救線上遊戲的世界一樣簡單。 而現在，我有個計畫， 這個計畫要說服更多人， 連同在座的各位，花更多時間去 玩更大，更好的遊戲。"}, {"zh-tw": " Right now we spend three billion hoursa week playing online games. Some of you might be thinking, \"That's a lot of timeto spend playing games.", "en": " 現在，我們每個禮拜共花三十億個鐘頭 在玩線上遊戲。 你們可能有人在想， 「哇！花那麼多時間打電動？」"}, {"zh-tw": " Maybe too much time, considering how many urgent problemswe have to solve in the real world.\" But actually, according to my researchat the Institute for the Future, actually the opposite is true. Three billion hours a weekis not nearly enough game play to solve the world's most urgent problems.", "en": " 這樣花太多時間在遊戲上了 現實生活中，還有很多我們得解決的急迫問題 但事實上，根據我在 \"未來學會(The Institute For The Future)\"所做的研究顯示 事實正好相反。 每週30億小時的遊戲時間還遠遠不夠 解決世上最急迫的問題。"}, {"zh-tw": " In fact, I believethat if we want to survive the next century on this planet, we need to increasethat total dramatically.

No. I'm serious. I am.", "en": " 所以，這其實跟我們一般認知有些相違背。 好，讓我再說一次，大家體會一下。 如果我們想解決以下這些問題：飢餓、 貧困、全球暖化、國際衝突、肥胖問題， 我堅信我們必須立志 去玩線上遊戲... 至少每週210億小時， 限時十年內！ 真的，我是認真的。"}, {"zh-tw": " Here's why.

So you can do it. They never give you a challengeyou can't achieve.", "en": " 因此，你有能力做到的 他們不會分派一個你做不到的任務給你"}, {"zh-tw": " But it is on the vergeof what you're capable of, so you have to try hard.

It's just better than reality.", "en": " 像《魔獸世界》這種網路遊戲 最令人滿足的 就是能與他人合作 一起獲得史詩般的勝利 也是為什麼我們會花這麼多時間玩遊戲 因為它比現實感受更好"}, {"zh-tw": " So, so far, collectivelyall the World of Warcraft gamers have spent 5.93 million years solving the virtual problems of Azeroth. Now, that's not necessarily a bad thing.", "en": " 目前為止，《魔獸世界》的玩家總共花費了 593萬年的時間 去解决艾澤拉斯裡的各種虛擬問題 這不是件壞事"}, {"zh-tw": " It might sound like it's a bad thing.

So when we talk about how much time we're currently investingin playing games, the only way it makes senseto even think about it is to talk about timeat the magnitude of human evolution, which is an extraordinary thing.", "en": " 成為第一種直立行走的靈長類動物 所以，當我們講到花了多少時間 玩電玩的時候，只要理性想想 在人類進化過程中 我們所花費的時間有多少 相比之下是多麼可觀"}, {"zh-tw": " But it's also apt, because it turns out that by spendingall this time playing games, we're actually changingwhat we are capable of as human beings. We're evolving to be a morecollaborative and hearty species.", "en": " 卻也合理，因為你會發現 我們花這麼多時間玩遊戲 反而漸漸改變了 我們身為人類的能力 我們不斷進化成更能合作，更友好的物種"}, {"zh-tw": " This is true. I believe this.
