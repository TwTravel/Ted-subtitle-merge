Well, we were talkingabout the human mind this morning. Did we simply loseour beastly impulses for revenge, for violent rituals, for pure rage? Or is there something else? In his latest book,Harvard professor Steven Pinker -- and many other thinkers before him -- concludes that one of the main drivers behind less violent societies is the spread of the constitutional state and the introduction, on a large scale, of the state monopolyon the legitimized use of violence -- legitimized by a democraticallyelected government, legitimized by checks and balancesand an independent judicial system.", "en": " 什麼原因呢? 為何暴力減少了呢? 是否人類的思維改變了呢? 我們早上談論過人類思維。 是否我們簡單的失去了 報復， 暴力儀式， 統粹憤怒的獸性衝動? 或者還有其他東西呢? 在他的新書裡， 哈彿大學教授 Steve Pinker -- 以及很多在他之前的思想家 -- 總結出現較少武力社會 背後的一個主要驅動力 是憲法國家的流行 以及大規模引入 國家對合法使用武力 的壟斷 -- 由民選政府， 存有制衡， 和獨立司法制度去決定是否合法。"}, {"zh-tw": " In other words, a state monopoly that has the use of violencewell under control.

Secondly, the presence of penalties that outweigh the benefitsof using violence tips the balance even further.", "en": " 消除了社會上 潛在不友善團體之間 軍事競賽 的誘因。 其次，使用武力得到的懲罰 遠超武力的好處 令平衡更傾向一邊。"}, {"zh-tw": " Abstaining from violence becomes more profitablethan starting a war. Now nonviolence starts to worklike a flywheel.", "en": " 放棄武力 較發動戰爭 變得更為有利。 現在，非武力開始 如飛輪運作。"}, {"zh-tw": " It enhances peace even further. Where there is no conflict,trade flourishes.", "en": " 進一步促進和平。 沒有衝突 貿易蓬勃發展。"}, {"zh-tw": " And trade is another importantincentive against violence. With trade, there's mutual interdependencyand mutual gain between parties.", "en": " 貿易又是另一個 減少武力的誘因。 貿易帶來互相依賴 和互利互惠。"}, {"zh-tw": " And when there is mutual gain,both sides stand to lose more than they would gainif they started a war. War is simply no longer the best option, and that is why violence has decreased.", "en": " 當出現互利的情況， 雙方開戰 帶來的損失 會高於得到的好處。 戰爭簡單來說 不再是最佳選擇， 武力因而減少。"}, {"zh-tw": " This, ladies and gentlemen, is the rationale behind the existenceof my armed forces.

My soldiers use the gunas an instrument of peace.", "en": " 就是這些參與維持和平的任務 得以解決 很多內戰。 我的戰士使用槍械 作為和平的工具。"}, {"zh-tw": " And this is exactlywhy failed states are so dangerous. Failed states have no legitimized,democratically controlled use of force.", "en": " 這亦正是非正常運作國家 為何會是那麼危險。 非正常運作國家 在使用軍事力量上沒有合法和民主的控制。"}, {"zh-tw": " Failed states do not know of the gunas an instrument of peace and stability. That is why failed states can drag downa whole region into chaos and conflict.", "en": " 非正常運作的國家不知道槍械 是和平穩定的工具。 這是為何非正常運作的國家 可令整個地區 陷入混亂和衝突中。"}, {"zh-tw": " That is why spreading the conceptof the constitutional state is such an important aspectof our foreign missions. That is why we are tryingto build a judicial system right now in Afghanistan.", "en": " 這是宣揚 憲法國家這個概念 是我們在國外的任務中 那麼重要的一環。 這是為何 我們正嘗試在阿富汗 建立司法制度的原因。"}, {"zh-tw": " That is why we trainpolice officers, we train judges, we train public prosecutorsaround the world. And that is why -- and in the Netherlands,we are very unique in that -- that is why the Dutch constitution states that one of the main tasksof the armed forces is to uphold and promotethe international rule of law.", "en": " 這是為何我們在世界各地培訓警官， 我們培訓法官， 我們培訓檢察官的原因。 這是為何 -- 在荷蘭，我們是獨一無二的 -- 這是為何荷蘭憲法聲明 軍隊其中一個 主要任務 是維持和促進 國際上的法治。"}, {"zh-tw": " Ladies and gentlemen, looking at this gun, we are confrontedwith the ugly side of the human mind. Every day I hope that politicians,diplomats, development workers can turn conflict into peace and threat into hope.", "en": " 先生，女仕們， 看著這枝槍 我們面對著 人類思想的陰暗面。 每一天我都希望 政治家、外交家、 發展人員 可把衝突 化為和平， 把威脅 化為希望。"}, {"zh-tw": " And I hope that one dayarmies can be disbanded and humans will find a wayof living together without violence and oppression. But until that day comes, we will have to make idealsand human failure meet somewhere in the middle.", "en": " 我希望最終有一天 可把軍隊解散 而人類找到方法 在沒有暴力或壓迫下一起生活。 然而，直至那一天到來， 我們還是要在理想 和人類錯敗 之間取得妥協。"}, {"zh-tw": " Until that day comes,I stand for my father who tried to shoot the Naziswith an old gun. I stand for my men and womenwho are prepared to risk their lives for a less violent world for all of us.", "en": " 直至那一天到來， 我支持我爸爸 試圖用舊式的槍枝 射擊納粹軍隊。 我支持我的男女戰士 他們為了一個少些武力的世界 準備好犧牲他們的性命。"}, {"zh-tw": " I stand for this soldierwho suffered partial hearing loss and sustained permanentinjuries to her leg, when she was hit by a rocketon a mission in Afghanistan.
