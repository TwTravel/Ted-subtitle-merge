It stands for Self-excited Tripedal Dynamic Experimental Robot. It's a robot that has three legs, which is inspired by nature.", "en": " 我們首先談到的機器人叫 STriDER， 它的意思是 三腳動力實驗性機器人。 這是一個有三隻腳的機器人， 它的靈感是從自然界中所獲得的。"}, {"zh-tw": " But have you seen anything in nature, an animal that has three legs? Probably not. So, why do I call this a biologically inspired robot? How would it work? But before that, let's look at pop culture. So, you know H.G. Wells' \"War of the Worlds,\" novel and movie.", "en": " 但是，你可曾看過自然界中 有三隻腳的生物嗎？ 大概沒有，那爲什麽我稱這機器人為 被生物所啓發的機器人？這機器人是怎麼運作的呢？ 在我解釋之前，讓我們先來看看流行文化， 都聽過 H.G.Wells 的世界大戰小說和電影吧。"}, {"zh-tw": " And what you see over here is a very popular video game, and in this fiction they describe these alien creatures that are robots that have three legs that terrorize Earth. But my robot, STriDER, does not move like this.", "en": " 你們現在在這邊所看到的是一個很熱門的 電腦遊戲。 在小說裏面，他們把這些襲擊地球的 外星生物描述成有三隻腳的機器人。 但是我的機器人 STriDER，不是這樣移動的。"}, {"zh-tw": " So, this is an actual dynamic simulation animation. I'm just going to show you how the robot works.", "en": " 這是一個真正的動力學模擬動畫。 我將會向你們展示這個機器人是如何運作的。"}, {"zh-tw": " It flips its body 180 degrees and it swings its leg between the two legs and catches the fall. So, that's how it walks. But when you look at us human being, bipedal walking, what you're doing is you're not really using a muscle to lift your leg and walk like a robot. Right? What you're doing is you really swing your leg and catch the fall, stand up again, swing your leg and catch the fall.", "en": " 它把自己翻了180度， 它通過甩動兩條腿中間的腿來防止自己跌倒。 看，它就是這樣走路的。但是，我們再看看自己， 人類 — 靠雙腿行走的生物， 我們並沒有用肌肉 抬起自己的腿，然後走得像個機器人，對吧？ 你做的實際上是甩開你的腿來止住自己跌倒的趨勢， 重新站穩，并再次甩開腿。"}, {"zh-tw": " You're using your built-in dynamics, the physics of your body, just like a pendulum. We call that the concept of passive dynamic locomotion.", "en": " 通過運用我們身體內置的動力機制 — 身體的物理構造， 就像個鐘擺一般， 我們把這概念叫做消極動力運動。"}, {"zh-tw": " What you're doing is, when you stand up, potential energy to kinetic energy, potential energy to kinetic energy. It's a constantly falling process.", "en": " 你做的是，當你站立的時候， 位能轉化 為動能， 這是一個普通的下落過程。"}, {"zh-tw": " So, even though there is nothing in nature that looks like this, really, we were inspired by biology and applying the principles of walking to this robot. Thus it's a biologically inspired robot. What you see over here, this is what we want to do next.", "en": " 所以，儘管自然界中沒有生物長成這樣， 我們仍然從生物學中受到啓發， 并製造出機器人的這種行走模式。 所以，這是一個受生物所啓發的機器人。 你們現在所看到的這個，則是我們接下來想要做的。"}, {"zh-tw": " We want to fold up the legs and shoot it up for long-range motion. And it deploys legs -- it looks almost like \"Star Wars\" -- when it lands, it absorbs the shock and starts walking.", "en": " 我們想把腿折起來，然後把它射出去以做長距離的移動。 它叉開它的腿，這讓它看起來像電影星際大戰裡面的角色。 當它降落的時候，它能吸收震盪，并開始行走。"}, {"zh-tw": " What you see over here, this yellow thing, this is not a death ray. This is just to show you that if you have cameras or different types of sensors -- because it is tall, it's 1.8 meters tall -- you can see over obstacles like bushes and those kinds of things.", "en": " 你們在這邊所看到的這個，這黃色的東西，這不是死光。 這只是用來告訴你，機器人上是否具備相機， 或別種感測器， 因為它很高，它有 1.8 公尺高， 所以你可以穿過像灌木叢這樣的障礙物來觀察前方。"}, {"zh-tw": " So we have two prototypes. The first version, in the back, that's STriDER I.", "en": " 我們做了兩個原型機， 第一版，後面的那個，這是 STriDER I，"}, {"zh-tw": " The one in front, the smaller, is STriDER II. The problem that we had with STriDER I is it was just too heavy in the body. We had so many motors, you know, aligning the joints, and those kinds of things.", "en": " 這在前面的，更小的，是 STriDER II. STriDER I 的問題是 身體過重。因為你知道，我們要 連接許多關節，所以安裝上很多馬達一類的東西。"}, {"zh-tw": " So, we decided to synthesize a mechanical mechanism so we could get rid of all the motors, and with a single motor we can coordinate all the motions. It's a mechanical solution to a problem, instead of using mechatronics.", "en": " 所以，我們決定想出一種機械原理， 以擺脫所有的馬達，只需使用單一馬達， 我們就可以連貫所有動作。 我們運用了機械原理來解決問題，而不是使用電子機械。"}, {"zh-tw": " So, with this now the top body is light enough. So, it's walking in our lab; this was the very first successful step. It's still not perfected -- its coffee falls down -- so we still have a lot of work to do.", "en": " 現在，機器人的上身輕得足夠讓它在實驗室行走。 這只是邁向成功的第一步。 它仍然是不完美的。它拿著的咖啡掉了， 所以，我們仍然有很多工作要做。"}, {"zh-tw": " The second robot I want to talk about is called IMPASS. It stands for Intelligent Mobility Platform with Actuated Spoke System.", "en": " 我要介紹的第二個機器人叫 IMPASS。 它的意思是輪輻驅動系統的智慧型移動平臺，"}, {"zh-tw": " So, it's a wheel-leg hybrid robot. So, think of a rimless wheel or a spoke wheel, but the spokes individually move in and out of the hub; so, it's a wheel-leg hybrid.", "en": " 這是個輪、腳混合的機器人。 試著想像一個沒輪框的輪子， 或者一個有輻條的輪子， 但是輪輻獨立地在輪軸裡外運動， 所以就成了輪、腳混合，"}, {"zh-tw": " We are literally re-inventing the wheel here. Let me demonstrate how it works.", "en": " 事實上，我們相當於重新發明了一種輪子。 讓我來示範一下它是如何運作的。"}, {"zh-tw": " So, in this video we're using an approach called the reactive approach. Just simply using the tactile sensors on the feet, it's trying to walk over a changing terrain, a soft terrain where it pushes down and changes.", "en": " 在這個影片裡，我們用了一種方法， 叫反應途徑。 只要運用它腳上的觸覺感應器， 它正嘗試穿過一個不停改變的地形， 一個柔軟的地形，它會受壓變形。"}, {"zh-tw": " And just by the tactile information, it successfully crosses over these type of terrain. But, when it encounters a very extreme terrain, in this case, this obstacle is more than three times the height of the robot, Then it switches to a deliberate mode, where it uses a laser range finder, and camera systems, to identify the obstacle and the size, and it plans, carefully plans the motion of the spokes and coordinates it so that it can show this kind of very very impressive mobility.", "en": " 僅憑藉它的觸覺訊息， 它成功地穿越了這些地形。 但，當它遭遇了一個十分嚴峻的地形，比如說： 在它前面的障礙是 它身高的3倍多， 它就會轉到一種思考模式， 這個模式使用一種鐳射找尋器， 以及相機系統，來確定障礙和它的體積， 然後它會做計劃，小心的計劃它輪輻的移動， 並協調其移動，因此，它就能夠做出這些 十分讓人驚歎的移動能力。"}, {"zh-tw": " You probably haven't seen anything like this out there. This is a very high mobility robot that we developed called IMPASS.", "en": " 你可能在外頭從沒看過類似這樣的東西。 這是我們所開發的一種有 很高移動能力的機器人，叫做 IMPASS。"}, {"zh-tw": " Ah, isn't that cool? When you drive your car, when you steer your car, you use a method called Ackermann steering. The front wheels rotate like this.", "en": " 啊...這不是很酷嗎？ 當你開車的時候， 當你駕駛你的汽車的時候，你用一種 叫做 Ackermann 的方法， 來做前輪驅動，像這樣。"}, {"zh-tw": " For most small wheeled robots, they use a method called differential steering where the left and right wheel turns the opposite direction. For IMPASS, we can do many, many different types of motion.", "en": " 對於大多數的小輪子機器人， 它們用一種叫差速齒輪方法， 即左右兩個輪分別轉向相反方向。 對於 IMPASS 來說，我們可以做很多不同類型的動作。"}, {"zh-tw": " For example, in this case, even though the left and right wheel is connected with a single axle rotating at the same angle of velocity. We just simply change the length of the spoke.", "en": " 舉例來說，在這裡，儘管左輪和右輪通過 單一輪軸相連，以相同的角速度在旋轉， 我們只要簡單的改變輪輻的長度，"}, {"zh-tw": " It affects the diameter and then can turn to the left, turn to the right. So, these are just some examples of the neat things that we can do with IMPASS.", "en": " 它影響了直徑，然後它就會向左轉，再向右轉。 所以，這只是一些 IMPASS 可以做到的美妙的例子。"}, {"zh-tw": " This robot is called CLIMBeR: Cable-suspended Limbed Intelligent Matching Behavior Robot. So, I've been talking to a lot of NASA JPL scientists -- at JPL they are famous for the Mars rovers -- and the scientists, geologists always tell me that the real interesting science, the science-rich sites, are always at the cliffs.", "en": " 這個機器人叫 CLIMBeR， 吊索智能行為協調機器人。 我曾和很多 NASA JPL 的科學家交談過， 他們是 JPL 登月機器人的專家。 這些科學家，地理學家總是告訴我， 真正有趣的科學研究， 富有研究價值的地點，總是在懸崖邊緣才能發現。"}, {"zh-tw": " But the current rovers cannot get there. So, inspired by that we wanted to build a robot that can climb a structured cliff environment.", "en": " 但是，現在的登月機器人到不了那些地方。 因此，受到這對話的啟發，我們想建一個機器人， 能夠攀爬懸崖峭壁，"}, {"zh-tw": " So, this is CLIMBeR. So, what it does, it has three legs. It's probably difficult to see, but it has a winch and a cable at the top -- and it tries to figure out the best place to put its foot.", "en": " 於是，我們有了 CLIMBeR。 來看看它是如何做到的，它有三條腿，這大概很難看到， 它有個絞盤和繩索在頂部， 它會嘗試找到最好的地方落腳。"}, {"zh-tw": " And then once it figures that out in real time, it calculates the force distribution: how much force it needs to exert to the surface so it doesn't tip and doesn't slip. Once it stabilizes that, it lifts a foot, and then with the winch it can climb up these kinds of thing.", "en": " 一旦找到了這地方， 它即時計算力量的分佈。 它需要多大的力氣才能在表面站穩， 而不至於會摔倒或者滑到。 一旦它穩定後，就會抬起一條腿， 然後，使用絞盤，它可以爬上這種東西。"}, {"zh-tw": " Also for search and rescue applications as well. Five years ago I actually worked at NASA JPL during the summer as a faculty fellow.", "en": " 這種技術用於搜索和救難同樣有用。 五年前的一個夏天我在 NASA JPL 兼任暑期教職。"}, {"zh-tw": " And they already had a six legged robot called LEMUR. So, this is actually based on that. This robot is called MARS: Multi-Appendage Robotic System. So, it's a hexapod robot.", "en": " 他們已經有一個六支腳的機器人，叫 LEMUR。 這機器人其實是以 LEMUR 為基礎的，它叫 MARS， 多附加機器人工程系統。是的，這是個六足機器人，"}, {"zh-tw": " We developed our adaptive gait planner. We actually have a very interesting payload on there.", "en": " 我們開發了自己的適應性步伐平台， 實際上，我們放了一個很有趣的貨物在它上面。"}, {"zh-tw": " The students like to have fun. And here you can see that it's walking over unstructured terrain. It's trying to walk on the coarse terrain, sandy area, but depending on the moisture content or the grain size of the sand the foot's soil sinkage model changes.", "en": " 學生們喜歡有趣的東西。這裡你可以看到它 走過沒有結構可言的地形。 它正嘗試穿過這粗糙的地形， 沙地， 根據濕度大小或者沙子顆粒大小， 它腳的泥土陷入模式會改變，"}, {"zh-tw": " So, it tries to adapt its gait to successfully cross over these kind of things. And also, it does some fun stuff, as can imagine.", "en": " 所以，它嘗試把它的步伐調整到能成功地穿過這些地方。 因此，可以想像，它會做出一些有趣的動作，"}, {"zh-tw": " We get so many visitors visiting our lab.

So, this does not have any sensors.", "en": " 那是在 2004 年， 在當時，這計畫非常、非常的有革命性。 這更像是一項可行性研究， 我們應該用怎麼樣的馬達呢？ 這真的可行嗎？我們要如何控制呢？ 沒有任何的感應器，"}, {"zh-tw": " So, it's an open loop control.
