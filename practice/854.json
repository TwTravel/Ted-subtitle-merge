This is the example. These are egg cases laid by a snail off the coast of Chile, and this is how many eggs they lay on the bottom.", "en": " 無脊椎動物也是一樣。這是一個例子 這是卵鞘 是生活在智利海岸的一種蝸牛下的 這是它們在海底產卵的數量"}, {"zh-tw": " Outside the reserve, you cannot even detect this. One point three million eggs per square meter inside the marine reserve where these snails are very abundant.", "en": " 在保護區之外 你根本看不到這個 一平方米有一百三十萬個卵 這是在蝸牛數量眾多的海洋保護區裡面"}, {"zh-tw": " So these organisms reproduce, the little larvae juveniles spill over, they all spill over, and then people can benefit from them outside too. This is in the Bahamas: Nassau grouper.", "en": " 所以這些生物體繁殖 這些幼蟲擴散出保護區 它們都會擴散出去 保護區之外的居民也因此受益 這是巴哈馬群島的拿騷石班魚"}, {"zh-tw": " Huge abundance of groupers inside the reserve, and the closer you get to the reserve, the more fish you have.

This is how much fishermen get everyday in Kenya, fishing over a series of years, in a place where there is no protection; it's a free-for-all.", "en": " 再看兩個例子 保護區如何對居民有利 這是肯尼亞漁民 每天捕到的魚的數量 好多年以來 在這個地方 沒有保護,完全放任自流"}, {"zh-tw": " Once the most degrading fishing gear, seine nets, were removed, the fishermen were catching more.

It happened in many places around the Caribbean.", "en": " 隨之而來的是整個種群的 繁殖力消亡 這在加勒比海的很多地方發生過"}, {"zh-tw": " And they would make 4,000 dollars per year, total, for the entire fishery, several fishing boats.

If this is so good, if this is such a no-brainer, how much of this do we have? And you already heard that less than one percent of the ocean's protected.

But what about the rest of the coast of the world, where people live and make a living out of fishing?
