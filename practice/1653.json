I don't have time for art.\" There are hundreds of reasons why we can't be artists right now.", "en": " 今天我的演講主題是 現在就當個藝術家吧 大多數人，在聽到這個話題時 總是很緊張很抗拒 「藝術不是我的菜，而且我現在很忙。 我得上學，找工作 送我的孩子去補習⋯」 你想著「我太忙了，我沒時間搞藝術。」 我們有數百種現在不能當藝術家的理由"}, {"zh-tw": " Don't they just pop into your head? There are so many reasons why we can't be, indeed, we're not sure why we should be.

Perhaps you think art is for the greatly gifted or for the thoroughly and professionally trained. And some of you may think you've strayed too far from art.", "en": " 為什麼人們總是立刻抗拒把自己與藝術相連的想法？ 或許你認為藝術是給那些大有天分的人 或那些受過完整專業訓練的人 有些人可能認為自己離藝術太遠了"}, {"zh-tw": " Well you might have, but I don't think so. This is the theme of my talk today.", "en": " 你或許這麼想，但我並不這麼認為 這就是我今天演講的主題"}, {"zh-tw": " We are all born artists.

I met an alien on my way home.\" Then a typical mom responds, \"Stop that nonsense.\" Now, an ideal parent is someone who responds like this: \"Really? An alien, huh? What did it look like?

He had to tour around Europe to support his family -- Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart -- but that was centuries ago, so we can make him an exception. Unfortunately, at some point our art -- such a joyful pastime -- ends.", "en": " 你們都認得這位紳士吧？ 他得巡迴歐洲以養家 沃夫岡·阿瑪迪斯·莫札特 但那是幾個世紀以前的事所以我們可以說他是例外 不幸的是，我們的藝術——多好玩的消遣——到了某個時期就結束了"}, {"zh-tw": " Kids have to go to lessons, to school, do homework and of course they take piano or ballet lessons, but they aren't fun anymore.

Well, Young-ha, you may not be good at drawing but you have a talent for storytelling.\" Or so I wished. \"Now you'll get it, you rascal!\" was the response.", "en": " 所以我解釋 「天色很黑，有隻烏鴉棲息在樹枝上。」 然後我的老師說 「是嗎？唉！英夏，你大概不擅長畫畫，但你有講故事的天份。」 我真希望是這樣的回答 「你死定了！你這混蛋！」才是老師的回答"}, {"zh-tw": " \"You'll get it!\" he said. You were supposed to draw the palace, the Gyeonghoeru, etc., but I was coloring everything in black, so he dragged me out of the group.", "en": " 「你死定了你！」他說 你應該要畫這個宮殿，景福宮之類的 但是我把每樣東西都塗黑了 所以他把我踢了出去"}, {"zh-tw": " There were a lot of girls there as well, so I was utterly mortified. None of my explanations or excuses were heard, and I really got it big time.", "en": " 當時那裡還有很多女孩子 我丟臉死了 我的解釋或理由都不被接受 而且我真的是死很大"}, {"zh-tw": " If he was an ideal teacher, he would have responded like I said before, \"Young-ha may not have a talent for drawing, but he has a gift for making up stories,\" and he would have encouraged me. But such a teacher is seldom found.", "en": " 如果他是位理想的老師他會以我之前說的來回應 「英夏或許在畫畫上沒有天份 但他在編故事上很有一手，」然後他還可以鼓勵我一下 但這樣的老師很難找到"}, {"zh-tw": " Later, I grew up and went to Europe's galleries -- I was a university student -- and I thought this was really unfair. Look what I found.", "en": " 後來，我長大後去了趟歐洲的畫廊 那時我是大學生而我心想這實在是太不公平了 看我找到什麼！"}, {"zh-tw": " Works like this were hung in Basel while I was punished and stood in front of the palace with my drawing in my mouth.

Contemporary art, I later discovered, isn't explained by a lame story like mine.", "en": " 當我被懲罰的時候像這樣的作品就高掛在巴塞爾 而我在景福宮前罰站嘴裡塞着我的畫 看看這個！這難道不像壁紙嗎？ 當代藝術，我後來發現，不會像我"}, {"zh-tw": " No crows are brought up. Most of the works have no title, Untitled.", "en": " 用一個憋腳的故事來解釋畫作不會提到烏鴉 大部分的作品是沒有標題的，《無題》"}, {"zh-tw": " Anyways, contemporary art in the 20th century is about doing something weird and filling the void with explanation and interpretation -- essentially the same as I did. Of course, my work was very amateur, but let's turn to more famous examples.", "en": " 反正二十世紀的當代藝術 就是做一些怪怪的東西然後隨你解釋及詮釋 跟我那時做的本質一樣 當然，我的作品非常不成熟 但我們來看看一些更有名的例子"}, {"zh-tw": " This is Picasso's. He stuck handlebars into a bike seat and called it \"Bull's Head.\" Sounds convincing, right? Next, a urinal was placed on its side and called \"Fountain\".", "en": " 這是畢卡索的作品 他把自行車把手插進座墊裡然後稱之為《牛頭》，很有說服力吧？ 下一張，把小便池翻轉以側邊平放，然後稱它為《噴泉》"}, {"zh-tw": " That was Duchamp. So filling the gap between explanation and a weird act with stories -- that's indeed what contemporary art is all about.", "en": " 那是杜象的作品 所以用故事來解釋怪怪的行為 那的確是當代藝術的重點所在"}, {"zh-tw": " Picasso even made the statement, \"I draw not what I see but what I think.\" Yes, it means I didn't have to draw Gyeonghoeru. I wish I knew what Picasso said back then. I could have argued better with my teacher.", "en": " 畢卡索甚至發表聲明 「我不畫我所看到的，我畫我所想的。」 是的，這就是說我不需要畫景福宮 我真希望當時我知道畢卡索說的這句話這樣我就可以跟老師好好辯論一番"}, {"zh-tw": " Unfortunately, the little artists within us are choked to death before we get to fight against the oppressors of art. They get locked in.", "en": " 可惜，這在我們體內的小小藝術家 在我們與迫害藝術者爭鬥前就已經窒息而死了 他們被封閉住"}, {"zh-tw": " That's our tragedy. So what happens when little artists get locked in, banished or even killed? Our artistic desire doesn't go away.", "en": " 那是我們的悲劇 所以當小藝術家被封閉、放逐或甚至殺了，會怎麼樣呢？ 我們對藝術的渴望不會消失"}, {"zh-tw": " We want to express, to reveal ourselves, but with the artist dead, the artistic desire reveals itself in dark form. In karaoke bars, there are always people who sing \"She's Gone\" or \"Hotel California,\" miming the guitar riffs.", "en": " 我們仍然想表達表現自我 但是隨著藝術家之死，這個渴望會用隱諱的形式表現出來 在卡拉OK店，總有人唱著 《她離開了我》或《加州旅館》 模仿彈吉他的樣子"}, {"zh-tw": " Usually they sound awful. Awful indeed. Some people turn into rockers like this.", "en": " 通常這些人都唱得很爛真的很爛 有些人變成像這樣的搖滾迷"}, {"zh-tw": " Or some people dance in clubs. People who would have enjoyed telling stories end up trolling on the Internet all night long.", "en": " 有些人在夜店裡跳舞 那些原本可以開心講故事的人 最後變成整晚掛網"}, {"zh-tw": " That's how a writing talent reveals itself on the dark side. Sometimes we see dads get more excited than their kids playing with Legos or putting together plastic robots.", "en": " 那就是寫作天分的隱諱表現 有時候我們看見爸爸比小孩還激動 玩著樂高或組塑膠機器人"}, {"zh-tw": " They go, \"Don't touch it. Daddy will do it for you.\" The kid has already lost interest and is doing something else, but the dad alone builds castles. This shows the artistic impulses inside us are suppressed, not gone.", "en": " 他們會說，「不要碰。爸爸幫你做。」 小孩已經失去興趣，去玩別的東西了 爸爸還在那裡一個人組城堡 這顯示在我們體內，想當藝術家的衝動是被壓制了，並沒有消失"}, {"zh-tw": " But they can often reveal themselves negatively, in the form of jealousy. You know the song \"I would love to be on TV\"? Why would we love it? TV is full of people who do what we wished to do, but never got to.", "en": " 但這股衝動也常常以負面的嫉妒形式表現 你們知道《我想上電視》這首歌吧?我們為什麼喜歡它呢? 因為電視里的人在做我們希望做 但無法達成的事"}, {"zh-tw": " They dance, they act -- and the more they do, they are praised. So we start to envy them.", "en": " 他們跳舞、演戲——做得愈多得到的讚賞也愈多 所以我們開始嫉妒他們"}, {"zh-tw": " We become dictators with a remote and start to criticize the people on TV. \"He just can't act.\" \"You call that singing? She can't hit the notes.\" We easily say these sorts of things.", "en": " 我們成為手拿遙控器的獨裁並且開始對電視上的那些人品頭論足 「他根本不會演！」「那個也叫唱歌？她根本五音不全。」 我們很容易說長道短這些東西"}, {"zh-tw": " We get jealous, not because we're evil, but because we have little artists pent up inside us. That's what I think.", "en": " 我們嫉妒不是因為我們很壞 而是因為體內被壓抑的藝術家 至少我是這麼認為"}, {"zh-tw": " What should we do then? Yes, that's right. Right now, we need to start our own art.", "en": " 那我們應該怎麼做？ 是的，沒錯 就在當下，我們要開始自己的藝術"}, {"zh-tw": " Right this minute, we can turn off TV, log off the Internet, get up and start to do something.

Likewise, stage art majors may become actors, and in this way you put on a show.", "en": " 舉個例，他們也可以寫劇本 而劇作家也可能作舞台藝術 同樣的，主修舞台藝術的人也可能當演員，這樣你也能演出戲劇"}, {"zh-tw": " Students at first wonder whether they can actually do it, but later they have so much fun. I rarely see anyone who is miserable doing a play. In school, the military or even in a mental institution, once you make people do it, they enjoy it.", "en": " 學生一開始都懷疑自己能不能做到 但後來他們都做得很開心，我幾乎不曾看過誰演戲的時候很悲慘 在學校、軍隊甚至在精神療養院一但你讓人們演戲，他們都很喜歡"}, {"zh-tw": " I saw this happen in the army -- many people had fun doing plays.

Look at your handwriting!\" It will say a lot of things.", "en": " 我之所以要讓他們像瘋了一樣的寫是因為 當你慢慢的寫，就會有很多事在你腦中跑來跑去 藝術惡魔會偷偷跑進來 這惡魔會告訴你千百個理由 為什麼你不會寫 「大家會笑你。這寫得不好。」 「你在寫什麼句子？看看你的筆跡！」 它會說很多事"}, {"zh-tw": " You have to run fast so the devil can't catch up.
