I want to know how I impact them.", "en": " 我想知道在我的晚餐料理背後的那些人。 我想知道我對他們會有怎樣的影響。"}, {"zh-tw": " I want to know how they impact me. I want to know why they fish.", "en": " 我想知道他們會如何影響我。 我想知道為什麼他們要捕魚。"}, {"zh-tw": " I want to know how they rely on the water's bounty for their living. Understanding all of this enables us to shift our perception of seafood away from a commodity to an opportunity to restore our ecosystem.", "en": " 我想知道他們有多麼依賴大海的賜予 藉以謀生。 了解這些可以讓我們 將我們對於海鮮的認知 從單純的商品 轉變為可以讓生態系統 回復的機會。"}, {"zh-tw": " It allows for us to celebrate the seafood that we're also so fortunate to eat. So what do we call this? I think we call it restorative seafood.", "en": " 了解這些可以讓我們慶幸 自己還能吃到海鮮。 所以，我們該稱之為什麼呢？ 我想我們該稱之為恢復性海鮮。"}, {"zh-tw": " Where sustainability is the capacity to endure and maintain, restorative is the ability to replenish and progress. Restorative seafood allows for an evolving and dynamic system and acknowledges our relationship with the ocean as a resource, suggesting that we engage to replenish the ocean and to encourage its resiliency.", "en": " 永續性是指 可以持續並進行修補的能力， 恢復性則是指可以補充並增加的能力。 恢復性海鮮可以產生一個不停演化進展的系統， 並且讓海洋能夠 變成我們的一種資源， 促使我們去讓海洋得以補充， 增加它的恢復力。"}, {"zh-tw": " It is a more hopeful, it is a more human, and is a more useful way of understanding our environment. Wallet guides -- standard issue by lots in the marine conservation world -- are very handy; they're a wonderful tool.", "en": " 這是一種比較有希望、比較人道， 也比較有效的方式來了解我們的環境。 消費指南 -- 是由 世界海洋保護組織所制定的標準 -- 相當方便，是很棒的工具書。"}, {"zh-tw": " Green, yellow and red lists [of] seafood species. The association is very easy: buy green, don't buy red, think twice about yellow.", "en": " 用綠色、黃色和紅色來標示海鮮種類。 很簡單的概念：買綠色的，不要買紅色的， 想買黃色的時候要三思。"}, {"zh-tw": " But in my mind, it's really not enough to just eat green list. We can't sustain this without the measure of our success really changing the fate of the species in the yellow and the red.", "en": " 但是對我來說， 只吃綠色的作法還是不夠。 如果無法確認這樣能成功的改變 那些黃色和紅色魚種的命運， 就無法保持其永續性。"}, {"zh-tw": " But what if we eat only in the green list?

Am I sitting down in a steakhouse to a 16-ounce portion of this? Do I do this three times a week? I might still be in the green list, but I'm not doing myself, or you, or the oceans any favors. The point is that we have to have a context, a gauge for our actions in all this.", "en": " 這一餐的含意是什麼？ 我會到牛排館點一份16盎司的黃鰭金槍魚嗎？ 我會每個禮拜吃三次嗎？ 也許我仍然在吃綠色標示的魚， 但是對我、對你， 或是對海洋來說都沒有好處。 重點是我們必須有一個概念， 對於我們所做的事情要有一個標準。"}, {"zh-tw": " Example: I've heard that red wine is great for my health -- antioxidants and minerals -- heart healthy.

Well folks, we have a protein problem. We have lost this sensibility when it regards our food, and we are paying a cost.", "en": " 那麼，在我喝出問題之前， 我可以喝多少瓶？ 朋友們，我們有個關於蛋白質的問題。 當它牽涉到食物時， 我們會失去對它的敏感度， 而我們會因此付出代價。"}, {"zh-tw": " The problem is we are hiding that cost beneath the waves. We are hiding that cost behind the social acceptance of expanding waistlines.", "en": " 問題是，我們將這代價隱藏在這種風潮之下。 我們將這代價 隱藏在社會接受腰圍變粗的現象之後。"}, {"zh-tw": " And we are hiding that cost behind monster profits. So the first thing about this idea of restorative seafood is that it really takes into account our needs.", "en": " 我們將這代價隱藏在巨大商業利益之後。 所以，關於恢復性海鮮第一件事， 是必須了解我們真正需要的數量。"}, {"zh-tw": " Restorative seafood might best be represented not by Jaws, or by Flipper, or the Gordon's fisherman, but rather, by the Jolly Green Giant.

But it's not all about the seafood.", "en": " 這是我不想錯過的好事。 但是這不單只是和海鮮有關。"}, {"zh-tw": " It's about the way that we look at our plates. As a chef, I realize the easiest thing for me to do is reduce the portion sizes on my plate.", "en": " 這還關係著我們怎麼看待我們餐盤裡的食物。 身為一個廚師，對我來說最簡單的作法， 就是減少餐盤裡面食物的量。"}, {"zh-tw": " A couple things happened. I made more money.", "en": " 幾件事情會隨之而生。 我會賺更多的錢。"}, {"zh-tw": " People started buying appetizers and salads, because they knew they weren't going to fill up on the entrees alone. People spent more time engaging in their meals, engaging with each other over their meals.", "en": " 人們開始購買開胃菜和沙拉， 因為他們知道只有主菜是吃不飽的。 人們會花更多時間在用餐上面， 藉由用餐而和別人有更多交流。"}, {"zh-tw": " People got, in short, more of what they came there for even though they got less protein. They got more calories over the course of a diversified meal.", "en": " 簡單來說，人們來這兒會得到比他們想要的還更多， 即使他們會攝取較少的蛋白質。 但他們在吃下各種餐點的過程中會獲得更多熱量。"}, {"zh-tw": " They got healthier. I made more money. This is great.", "en": " 他們會更健康，我賺更多的錢。 真是太棒了。"}, {"zh-tw": " Environmental consideration was served with every plate, but it was served with a heaping mound of consideration for human interests at the same time. One of the other things we did was begin to diversify the species that we served -- small silverfish, anchovies, mackerel, sardines were uncommon.", "en": " 每道菜在上桌之前都先評估過對環境的影響， 同時，也考慮到許多 關於人們利益的部份。 我們所做的另外一件事是， 將我們所提供的食材種類多樣化 -- 小銀魚、鯷魚、鯖魚、沙丁魚都很常見。"}, {"zh-tw": " Shellfish, mussels, oysters, clams, tilapia, char -- these were the common species. We were directing tastes towards more resilience, more restorative options.", "en": " 貝類、蚌類、牡蠣、 蛤蠣、鯛魚、嘉魚 -- 這些都是常見的魚類。 我們讓這些口味 傾向比較有彈性、比較具有恢復性的選擇。"}, {"zh-tw": " This is what we need to favor. This is what the green list says.", "en": " 這是我們應該偏好的選擇。 這才是綠色標示的意義。"}, {"zh-tw": " But this is also how we can actually begin to restore our environment.
