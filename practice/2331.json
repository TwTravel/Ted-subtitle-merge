And those issues stayedwith me and guided me, and in particular, when I was elected the firstwoman President of Ireland, from 1990 to 1997. I dedicated my presidency to having a space for those who feltmarginalized on the island of Ireland, and bringing together communitiesfrom Northern Ireland with those from the Republic, trying to build peace.", "en": " 所以想當然爾我對人權、 平等及正義產生興趣， 當然還要會用我的手肘！ 這些議題隨著我、帶領我成長， 特別是在 我當選為愛爾蘭第一位女總統， 任期在 1990 到 1997 年間。 我在位期間， 致力給予愛爾蘭島上覺得被邊緣化的人生存空間， 並促使北愛爾蘭社群 與共和國社群和解， 試著建立和平。"}, {"zh-tw": " And I went as the first Irish presidentto the United Kingdom and met with Queen Elizabeth II, and also welcomed to myofficial residence -- which we call \"Áras an Uachtaráin,\"the house of the president -- members of the royal family, including, notably, the Prince of Wales.

I think it was reallythe importance of the injustice that really struck me very forcibly.", "en": " 所以為此受到無比痛苦的人， 不開車、不用電、也不怎麼消費， 然而他們卻覺得愈來愈受 氣候變遷的衝擊。 這樣的變遷讓他們不知道該如何適當種植食物， 該如何展望未來。 我想真的是不公義的重要性 強烈的衝擊我。"}, {"zh-tw": " And I know that we're not ableto address some of that injustice because we're not on coursefor a safe world. Governments around the world agreedat the conference in Copenhagen, and have repeated itat every conference on climate, that we have to staybelow two degrees Celsius of warming above pre-Industrial standards.", "en": " 我知道我們無法解決那些不公義， 因為我們沒有走向安全的世界。 全世界的政府都在哥本哈根大會上同意， 也在每一場氣候變遷會議上不斷看到， 我們的暖化程度 與工業革命前的標準相比，不可超過攝氏 2 度。"}, {"zh-tw": " But we're on coursefor about four degrees. So we face an existential threatto the future of our planet.", "en": " 我們卻朝著上升 4 度去。 所以我們面對著地球未來的存亡關頭。"}, {"zh-tw": " And that made me realize that climate change is the greatest threatto human rights in the 21st century.

First of all, to be on the side of those who aresuffering most and are most effected.", "en": " 氣候正義能回答道德爭論── 無論是氣候變遷爭論的哪一方。 首先， 站在最痛苦最受影響的一方。"}, {"zh-tw": " And secondly, to make sure that they're not left behindagain, when we start to move and start to address climate changewith climate action, as we are doing. In our very unequal world today, it's very striking how manypeople are left behind.", "en": " 第二， 我們要確保在開始行動時， 開始以氣候行動對付氣候變遷時，不能再遺忘他們， 就像我們現在所為。 今天在這個非常不平等的世界， 你會很驚訝有多少人被遺忘了。"}, {"zh-tw": " In our world of 7.2 billion people,about 3 billion are left behind. 1.3 billion don't have accessto electricity, and they light their homeswith kerosene and candles, both of which are dangerous.", "en": " 世界 72 億人口中，有 30 億人被遺忘。 13 億人沒有電可用， 他們以煤油及蠟燭點亮房屋， 這兩者都很危險。"}, {"zh-tw": " And in fact they spend a lot of theirtiny income on that form of lighting. 2.6 billion people cook on open fires -- on coal, wood and animal dung.", "en": " 事實上他們大部分的收入，都花在這種照明方式上。 26 億人以露天爐灶煮飯， 燒煤、木頭或動物糞便。"}, {"zh-tw": " And this causesabout 4 million deaths a year from indoor smoke inhalation, and of course, most of thosewho die are women. So we have a very unequal world, and we need to changefrom \"business as usual.\" And we shouldn't underestimatethe scale and the transformative nature of the change which will be needed, because we have to go to zerocarbon emissions by about 2050, if we're going to stay belowtwo degrees Celsius of warming.", "en": " 這造成每年四百萬人口死亡， 因為吸入室內煙霧， 當然，大部分的死者是婦女。 所以我們有個非常不平等的世界， 我們必須改變「一切如常」的想法。 我們不應該低估 我們所需的改變規模及其轉變能力。 因為我們的碳排放量必須在 2050 年達到零， 才能讓暖化程度如預期保持低於攝氏 2 度。"}, {"zh-tw": " And that means we have to leaveabout two-thirds of the known resources of fossil fuels in the ground. It's a very big change, and it means that obviously, industrialized countriesmust cut their emissions, must become much more energy-efficient, and must move as quickly as possibleto renewable energy.", "en": " 那意味著我們必須停止開採大約三分之二的已知資源， 即化石燃料。 這是很大的改變。 而且這意味著， 顯然工業化國家必須減少排放量， 必須變得更加節能， 必須盡快發展使用再生能源。"}, {"zh-tw": " For developing countriesand emerging economies, the problem and the challengeis to grow without emissions, because they must develop;they have very poor populations. So they must develop without emissions,and that is a different kind of problem.", "en": " 對開發中國家及新興經濟體而言， 問題及挑戰在於零排放成長， 因為他們必須開發，他們的居民非常貧窮。 所以他們必須開發，又要零排放，這是不同類型的問題。"}, {"zh-tw": " Indeed, no country in the worldhas actually grown without emissions. All the countries have developedwith fossil fuels, and then may be movingto renewable energy.", "en": " 確實，世界上沒有任何一個國家可以做到零排放成長。 所有國家的開發都靠化石燃料， 然後或許能轉變成依靠再生能源。"}, {"zh-tw": " So it is a very big challenge, and it requires the total supportof the international community, with the necessary finance and technology,and systems and support, because no country can make itself safefrom the dangers of climate change. This is an issue that requirescomplete human solidarity.", "en": " 所以這是非常大的挑戰， 這需要國際社會全面支持， 提供必要的資金和技術，系統及支援， 因為沒有一個國家能在氣候變遷的危險下自掃門前雪。 這個議題需要人類全面團結。"}, {"zh-tw": " Human solidarity, if you like,based on self-interest -- because we are all in this together, and we have to work together to ensure that we reachzero carbon by 2050. The good news is that change is happening, and it's happening very fast.", "en": " 人類團結，你也可以說是基於自我利益， 因為我們同在一艘船上， 我們必須合作 以確保我們在 2050 年達到零碳排放量。 好消息是改變已經開始， 而且發展得很快。"}, {"zh-tw": " Here in California, there's a very ambitiousemissions target to cut emissions. In Hawaii, they're passing legislation to have 100 percentrenewable energy by 2045.", "en": " 在加州這裡， 設定非常遠大的目標，以減少溫室氣體排放。 在夏威夷，他們剛剛通過立法， 要在 2045 年達到百分之百的再生能源。"}, {"zh-tw": " And governments are very ambitiousaround the world.

Apple have pledged that their factoriesin China will use renewable energy.", "en": " 衣索匹亞承諾要在2027 年達到碳中和。 蘋果公司誓言要讓在中國的工廠使用再生能源。"}, {"zh-tw": " And there is a race on at the moment to convert electricityfrom tidal and wave power, in order that we can leavethe coal in the ground. And that change is both welcomeand is happening very rapidly.", "en": " 目前也有一場競賽， 要從潮汐能發電， 如此我們才能停止開採煤炭。 這樣的改變既受歡迎也發展快速。"}, {"zh-tw": " But it's still not enough, and the political willis still not enough. Let me come back to President Tongand his people in Kiribati.", "en": " 但這還不夠， 而且光有政治決心還是不夠。 讓我再回頭談談湯總統及吉里巴斯的人民。"}, {"zh-tw": " They actually could be able to liveon their island and have a solution, but it would take a lot of political will. President Tong told meabout his ambitious idea to either build up or even floatthe little islands where his people live.", "en": " 他們還是可以在他們的島上生活，而且有解決方案， 但是這要下很大的政治決心。 湯總統告訴我他的雄心壯志， 要把民眾住的小島加高，甚至讓島漂起來。"}, {"zh-tw": " This, of course, is beyondthe resources of Kiribati itself. It would require great solidarityand support from other countries, and it would requirethe kind of imaginative idea that we bring together when we wantto have a space station in the air.", "en": " 想當然爾，這絕非吉里巴斯憑一國之力就能做到。 這需要其他國家的大團結及支援， 這也需要那種富有想像力的構想， 如同我們想在空中建造太空站時的集思廣義。"}, {"zh-tw": " But wouldn't it be wonderfulto have this engineering wonder and to allow a people to remainin their sovereign territory, and be part of the community of nations? That is the kind of ideathat we should be thinking about. Yes, the challengesof the transformation we need are big, but they can be solved.", "en": " 但這不是很棒嗎？創造這種工程奇景， 讓一個國家的人民能留在他們獨立自主的領土上， 並成為國際社會的一部分？ 這才是我們應該思索的計畫。 的確，我們所需的變革挑戰很大。 但是我們可以克服這樣的挑戰。"}, {"zh-tw": " We are actually, as a people, very capable of coming togetherto solve problems. I was very conscious of thisas I took part this year in commemoration of the 70th anniversary of the end of the SecondWorld War in 1945.", "en": " 我們身為人， 其實很有能力一同解決問題。 我對此非常清楚，因為我今年參加了 1945 年二次世界大戰結束70 周年紀念。"}, {"zh-tw": " 1945 was an extraordinary year. It was a year when the world faced what must have seemed almostinsoluble problems -- the devastation of the world wars,particularly the Second World War; the fragile peace that hadbeen brought about; the need for a wholeeconomic regeneration.", "en": " 1945 年是非常不平凡的一年。 那年，全世界面對了幾項 看似幾乎無法解決的問題── 兩次世界大戰的蹂躪，尤其是二次世界大戰； 隨之而來不穩固的和平； 整體經濟復興的需求。"}, {"zh-tw": " But the leaders of that timedidn't flinch from this. They had the capacity, they hada sense of being driven by never again must the worldhave this kind of problem.", "en": " 但是當時的領導人並不因此而退縮。 他們有能力，他們的動力來自於 絕不容許世界再發生相同的問題。"}, {"zh-tw": " And they had to build structuresfor peace and security.

The Charter of the United Nations, the Bretton Woods institutions,as they're called, The World Bank, and the International Monetary Fund.", "en": " 他們必須為和平及安全建立架構。 我們因此得到什麼？他們完成了什麼？ 聯合國憲章， 及一般說的布雷頓森林協定，世界銀行， 國際貨幣基金。"}, {"zh-tw": " A Marshall Plan for Europe,a devastated Europe, to reconstruct it. And indeed a few years later, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.", "en": " 歐洲的馬歇爾計劃，滿目瘡痍的歐洲， 他們要重建此地。 甚至在數年之後， 還有世界人權宣言。"}, {"zh-tw": " 2015 is a year that is similarin its importance to 1945, with similar challengesand similar potential.
