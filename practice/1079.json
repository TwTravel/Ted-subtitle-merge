And I'm saying this as an economist who, over the past few years, has focused my research on what it is we think and who it is we trust and why, but also -- and I'm aware of the irony here -- as an expert myself, as a professor, as somebody who advises prime ministers, heads of big companies, international organizations, but an expert who believes that the role of experts needs to change, that we need to become more open-minded, more democratic and be more open to people rebelling against our points of view.", "en": " 為了我們的健康 我們的財富 和我們共同的安全 我們必須保持 大腦獨立作決策的區塊 是在作用的 身為一位經濟學家我要說 在過去的幾年 我專注在我的研究 有關我們的思考 還有我們信任誰，為什麼信任他們 但是 我也意識到這有點諷刺 我自己身為一位專家、 一位教授、 一位會提供首相建議、 給公司老闆建議、 提供國際組織建議的人 但我也相信 專家的角色需要改變 我們對不同意見的接受度要更寬廣 更民主 也要更開放去看待 反對我們 意見的人"}, {"zh-tw": " So in order to help you understand where I'm coming from, let me bring you into my world, the world of experts.

And what all this means is that paradigms take far too long to shift, that complexity and nuance are ignored and also that money talks -- because we've all seen the evidence of pharmaceutical companies funding studies of drugs that conveniently leave out their worst side effects, or studies funded by food companies of their new products, massively exaggerating the health benefits of the products they're about to bring by market.", "en": " 看吧 我們也學到 專家會被侷限 會被影響 受到社會和文化教條的規範 自己時代的規範 無論是醫生 在維多利亞時期 說送婦女到收容所 是為減低性慾 或在美國的精神科醫生 直到1973年 能把同性戀歸類為 一種精神疾病 這一切都表示了 這些準則 要花上很多時間去改變 原本被忽略的複雜性和細微差別 不僅如此，有錢能使鬼推磨 我們都知道 那些製藥廠商 資助藥品的研究 所以很方便地 掩飾掉藥品的副作用 或是食品廠商贊助 新開發的食品 過度誇大食品的健康療效 特別是正要上市的食品"}, {"zh-tw": " The study showed that food companies exaggerated typically seven times more than an independent study.

So if a radiologist is looking at the scan of a patient with suspected pneumonia, say, what happens is that, if they see evidence of pneumonia on the scan, they literally stop looking at it -- thereby missing the tumor sitting three inches below on the patient's lungs.", "en": " 普遍的思維錯誤 例如在放射科 當他們在看CT掃描時 都會過分受到 不管是 病人的前一位醫師所說的 或是他懷疑的 可能病因的影響 所以如果一位放射科醫生 看著那掃描片子 是一位疑似肺炎病人的片子 他很可能 一看到片子上 有肺炎的事實 他們直接停止看片子 因而忽略了腫瘤 在下方三英寸的地方 長在病人的肺裡"}, {"zh-tw": " I've shared with you so far some insights into the world of experts. These are, of course, not the only insights I could share, but I hope they give you a clear sense at least of why we need to stop kowtowing to them, why we need to rebel and why we need to switch our independent decision-making capabilities on.", "en": " 目前我跟你們分享的 是專家領域裡的一些觀察 這些當然 不只是一些我觀察到的 但我希望這能讓你們至少多點了解 為何我們需要停止對專家唯命是從 為何我們需要反制 還有為何我們需要 讓我們大腦獨立決策的能力作用"}, {"zh-tw": " But how can we do this? Well for the sake of time, I want to focus on just three strategies. First, we've got to be ready and willing to take experts on and dispense with this notion of them as modern-day apostles.", "en": " 但我們該怎麼做呢？ 因為時間的關係 我只談三種策略 第一：我們必須準備好而且有意願 挑戰專家 但不要把專家的話當成 宗教信仰的教條"}, {"zh-tw": " This doesn't mean having to get a Ph.D. in every single subject, you'll be relieved to hear.", "en": " 這不代表我們必須在 每個領域上拿博士學位 聽到之後應該鬆了一口氣"}, {"zh-tw": " But it does mean persisting in the face of their inevitable annoyance when, for example, we want them to explain things to us in language that we can actually understand. Why was it that, when I had an operation, my doctor said to me, \"Beware, Ms. Hertz, of hyperpyrexia,\" when he could have just as easily said, \"Watch out for a high fever.\" You see, being ready to take experts on is about also being willing to dig behind their graphs, their equations, their forecasts, their prophecies, and being armed with the questions to do that -- questions like: What are the assumptions that underpin this? What is the evidence upon which this is based? What has your investigation focused on? And what has it ignored? It recently came out that experts trialing drugs before they come to market typically trial drugs first, primarily on male animals and then, primarily on men.", "en": " 但它確實意味著堅持 在面對不可避免的煩惱時 例如 我們需要他們為我們解釋一些事情 用我們能了解的話語 怎麼說呢，當我需要動手術 我的醫生跟我說 \"Hertz小姐，要留意 高熱症的發生\" 但他其實能簡單的跟我說 要留意是否發高燒？ 了解嗎，要挑戰專家 就是要有意願 去了解他們圖表的意義 他們的方程式、預測 他們的預言 要準備好問題問他們 像是問 假設基準為何？ 證據是根據什麼得到的？ 你們的調查重點是什麼？ 為什麼這個因素被忽略？ 最近發現 專家們測試藥品 在上市之前 通常藥品測試 主要是對雄性動物 接著才對男性做測試"}, {"zh-tw": " It seems that they've somehow overlooked the fact that over half the world's population are women. And women have drawn the short medical straw because it now turns out that many of these drugs don't work nearly as well on women as they do on men -- and the drugs that do work well work so well that they're actively harmful for women to take.", "en": " 看來，他們已經在某種程度上忽略了一個事實 這個世界的人口有一半是女性 女性病患在醫療成功的機率比較小 因為大部分的藥物 在女性病患身上效果較差 和男性患者比起來的話 藥品療效在男性身上較好 而對女性患者是有害的"}, {"zh-tw": " Being a rebel is about recognizing that experts' assumptions and their methodologies can easily be flawed. Second, we need to create the space for what I call \"managed dissent.\" If we are to shift paradigms, if we are to make breakthroughs, if we are to destroy myths, we need to create an environment in which expert ideas are battling it out, in which we're bringing in new, diverse, discordant, heretical views into the discussion, fearlessly, in the knowledge that progress comes about, not only from the creation of ideas, but also from their destruction -- and also from the knowledge that, by surrounding ourselves by divergent, discordant, heretical views.", "en": " 要當一個反抗的人要知道 專家用的假設 和他們的理論 是很容易有錯誤的 第二： 我們需要創造空間 去管理不同的意見 如果我們要改變規範 如果我們要有所突破 如果我們要打破迷思 我們需要創造出一個空間 讓專家的意見是被辯論出來的 我們要把 新的、多樣的、不同的，不同宗教的意見 帶進討論裡 而且是無所畏懼的 在談到關於知識的進展 不只是建立想法 也包括拋去想法 各種知識裡 在我們周遭 不同、不一致的 不同宗教派別的觀點"}, {"zh-tw": " All the research now shows us that this actually makes us smarter. Encouraging dissent is a rebellious notion because it goes against our very instincts, which are to surround ourselves with opinions and advice that we already believe or want to be true.", "en": " 所有的研究告訴我們 這些實際上都讓我們變得聰明 鼓勵反對的意見是一種反抗的概念 因為這是在抗拒我們的本能 我們喜歡處在 一個意見和建議 被公認正確 或是事實的環境裡"}, {"zh-tw": " And that's why I talk about the need to actively manage dissent. Google CEO Eric Schmidt is a practical practitioner of this philosophy.", "en": " 這也是我為何談到我們需要 主動地去了解這些不同的聲音 Google執行長Eric Schmidt 是一位這種理念 的實踐者"}, {"zh-tw": " In meetings, he looks out for the person in the room -- arms crossed, looking a bit bemused -- and draws them into the discussion, trying to see if they indeed are the person with a different opinion, so that they have dissent within the room. Managing dissent is about recognizing the value of disagreement, discord and difference.", "en": " 開會時，他會找會議室中那一個 雙手交疊，看起來有點困惑 並請他們加入討論 試著要了解他們 是否有不同的意見 他們是否是會議裡有異議的人 了解異議 是要去區分出 不同意，不一致 和不同的價值"}, {"zh-tw": " But we need to go even further. We need to fundamentally redefine who it is that experts are.", "en": " 但我們需要更進一步 我們需要從根本上重新定義 誰才是專家"}, {"zh-tw": " The conventional notion is that experts are people with advanced degrees, fancy titles, diplomas, best-selling books -- high-status individuals.

By leveraging and by embracing the expertise within the company, Best Buy was able to discover, for example, that the store that it was going to open in China -- its big, grand store -- was not going to open on time.", "en": " 像是Best Buy的店員 消費性電子產品公司的 所有員工 從清潔工、店員 到高階主管 包括他們預測團隊 去打賭，你們沒聽錯 去打賭一樣東西 像是一項可能在聖誕節前暢銷的產品 或是決定顧客的新想法 是否要被公司採納 或是一項計畫 是否要如期執行 透過利用 還有接納 在公司裡的專業人才 Best Buy可以去發掘，例如 即將要在中國開立的營業據點 一間大型的門市 不會如期開張"}, {"zh-tw": " Because when it asked its staff, all its staff, to place their bets on whether they thought the store would open on time or not, a group from the finance department placed all their chips on that not happening.

For if we keep our independent decision-making part of our brains switched on, if we challenge experts, if we're skeptical, if we devolve authority, if we are rebellious, but also if we become much more comfortable with nuance, uncertainty and doubt, and if we allow our experts to express themselves using those terms too, we will set ourselves up much better for the challenges of the 21st century.", "en": " 然而 我今晚要談的策略 -- 接納不同的意見 挑戰專家 把專業知識大眾化 反抗的策略 都是我認為 能幫助我們有效了解 當我們要嘗試面對挑戰的時候 面對那些困惑、複雜 艱難的挑戰時 如果我們能 讓我們大腦獨立決策的區塊 有效運作 如果我們挑戰專家，我們去質疑 如果我們下放權力 如果我們反抗 同時 我們能自在的了解 那些細微差別 和不確定的疑惑 還有我們讓專家 在發表言論時 也能做到這樣 那我們能幫助自己 更能去面對 21世紀的挑戰"}, {"zh-tw": " For now, more than ever, is not the time to be blindly following, blindly accepting, blindly trusting.
