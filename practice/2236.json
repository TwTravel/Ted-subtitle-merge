I'm going to talk to you today about laughter, and I just want to start by thinking about the first time I can ever remember noticing laughter. This is when I was a little girl.I would've been about six.", "en": " 大家好，我們今天來談笑聲， 我想從回想我自己第一次 注意到笑聲開始說起。 那時我還是一個小女孩，大概六歲左右。"}, {"zh-tw": " And I came across my parentsdoing something unusual, where they were laughing. They were laughing very, very hard.", "en": " 我正好看見我的父母在做一件不太尋常的事， 他們當時正在笑。 他們笑得非常非常開心。"}, {"zh-tw": " They were lying on the floor laughing. They were screaming with laughter.", "en": " 他們笑倒在地板上。 他們尖聲大笑。"}, {"zh-tw": " I did not know what they were laughing at, but I wanted in. I wanted to be part of that, and I kind of sat around at the edgegoing, \"Hoo hoo!\" Now, incidentally,what they were laughing at was a song which people used to sing, which was based aroundsigns in toilets on trains telling you what you couldand could not do in toilets on trains.", "en": " 我不知道他們在笑什麼，但我想和他們一起笑。 我想成為這個笑聲的一部分， 我就坐在他們旁邊，叫著 「呵呵！」 順帶一提，他們當時在笑的 是當時流行的一首歌， 這首歌把火車廁所的標示寫進詞裡， 告訴你在火車廁所裡， 什麼可以做，什麼不可以做。"}, {"zh-tw": " And the thing you have to rememberabout the English is, of course, we do have an immenselysophisticated sense of humor. At the time, though, I didn'tunderstand anything of that.", "en": " 有件事你們一定要記得，當然就是我們英國人 的確有著無限複雜的幽默感。 但是，我當時並不理解這些，"}, {"zh-tw": " I just cared about the laughter, and actually, as a neuroscientist,I've come to care about it again. And it is a really weird thing to do.", "en": " 我只是很在意笑聲， 而且其實現在身為神經學家，我開始重新關注這個問題。 笑真的是一件非常奇怪的事。"}, {"zh-tw": " What I'm going to do nowis just play some examples of real human beings laughing, and I want you think about the soundpeople make and how odd that can be, and in fact how primitivelaughter is as a sound. It's much more like an animal callthan it is like speech.", "en": " 我現在要放幾段 真人在笑的例子， 我想讓大家想想人類發出的聲音，這些聲音可以多麼奇怪， 以及，笑聲是一種多麼原始的聲音。 笑聲更像是動物的叫聲，而不像說話。"}, {"zh-tw": " So here we've got some laughter for you.The first one is pretty joyful. (Audio: Laughing) Now this next guy, I need him to breathe.", "en": " 現在來聽聽這幾段笑聲。第一段還挺好笑。 （音訊：笑聲） 下一段的傢伙得去喘口氣。"}, {"zh-tw": " There's a point in therewhere I'm just, like, you've got to get some air in there, mate, because he just soundslike he's breathing out. (Audio: Laughing) This hasn't been edited; this is him.", "en": " 有一段到了一個地步， 我說老兄你真的需要吸氣， 因爲他聽起來真像喘不過氣了。 （音訊：笑聲） 這没有被編輯過，就是他在笑。"}, {"zh-tw": " (Audio: Laughing) And finally we have -- this is a human female laughing. And laughter can take us to some prettyodd places in terms of making noises.", "en": " （音訊：笑聲） 最後，我們有一段女人的笑聲。 從發出聲音的角度來看，笑聲能讓我們聯想到奇怪的地方。"}, {"zh-tw": " (Audio: Laughing) She actually says, \"Oh my God,what is that?\" in French. We're all kind of with her.I have no idea.", "en": " （音訊：笑聲） 她其實在用法語說：「我的天啊，這是什麼東西？」 應該是這樣吧？我也不知道。"}, {"zh-tw": " Now, to understand laughter,you have to look at a part of the body that psychologists and neuroscientistsdon't normally spend much time looking at, which is the ribcage, and it doesn't seem terribly exciting, but actually you're all using your ribcage all the time. What you're all doing at the moment with your ribcage, and don't stop doing it, is breathing.", "en": " 要理解笑聲，你必須去觀察身體的某部分， 心理學家和神經學家通常不會花很多時間去觀察這部分， 就是胸腔， 聽起來沒什麼了不起喔？ 但事實上你一直在使用你的胸腔。 你無時無刻都在使用你的胸腔， 千萬不要停止使用它，因為你在呼吸。"}, {"zh-tw": " So you use the intercostal muscles,the muscles between your ribs, to bring air in and out of your lungs just by expandingand contracting your ribcage, and if I was to put a strap around the outside of your chest called a breath belt, and just look at that movement, you see a rather gentle sinusoidalmovement, so that's breathing. You're all doing it. Don't stop.", "en": " 你使用肋間肌，也就是在你肋骨之間的肌肉 來擴張及收縮你的胸腔， 讓空氣進出你的肺， 如果我把一條帶子繞在你的胸腔外部， 叫它呼吸帶吧，然後看它的移動， 你會看見緩和的正旋起伏律動，那就是呼吸。 你們全都在做這件事。不要停止。 一旦你開始說話，"}, {"zh-tw": " As soon as you start talking, you start using your breathingcompletely differently. So what I'm doing now is you seesomething much more like this.", "en": " 你的呼吸會變得完全不同。 所以我現在做的就很像這樣。"}, {"zh-tw": " In talking, you use very finemovements of the ribcage to squeeze the air out -- and in fact, we're the only animalsthat can do this. It's why we can talk at all.", "en": " 在說話的時候，你的胸腔進行細微的運動 把空氣擠出去。 事實上，我們是唯一可以這樣做的動物。 這也就是為什麼我們能說話。"}, {"zh-tw": " Now, both talking and breathinghas a mortal enemy, and that enemy is laughter, because what happens when you laugh is those same musclesstart to contract very regularly, and you get this very markedsort of zig-zagging, and that's just squeezingthe air out of you. It literally is that basic a wayof making a sound.", "en": " 說話及呼吸有個致命的敵人， 那個敵人就是笑， 因為當你在笑的時候， 同樣的那群肌肉會開始規律地收縮， 你就會得到這樣非常顯著的鋸齒狀訊號， 這只是把空氣擠出你的肺， 也是發出聲音的基本原理。"}, {"zh-tw": " You could be stamping on somebody,it's having the same effect. You're just squeezing air out, and each of those contractions --Ha! -- gives you a sound.", "en": " 這套用到所有人身上都有一樣的效果。 你只是把空氣擠出去， 每一次的收縮「哈！」都讓你發出聲音。"}, {"zh-tw": " And as the contractions run together,you can get these spasms, and that's when you start gettingthese -- (Wheezing) -- things happening. I'm brilliant at this.", "en": " 當這些收縮彼此相連的時候，就有這些痙攣， 所以你就會有（喘氣聲）這樣的聲音。 這個我超會。"}, {"zh-tw": " Now, in terms of the science of laughter,there isn't very much, but it does turn out that pretty mucheverything we think we know about laughter is wrong. So it's not at all unusual, for example,to hear people to say humans are the only animals that laugh.", "en": " 要講笑的科學，這並沒有太大的意義。 但是這告訴我們基本上我們對笑的認知 都是錯的。 所以舉個例子，我們一點也不意外 有人說人類是唯一會笑的動物。"}, {"zh-tw": " Nietzsche thought that humansare the only animals that laugh. In fact, you find laughterthroughout the mammals.", "en": " 尼采就認為人類是唯一會笑的動物。 事實上，很多哺乳類動物都會笑。"}, {"zh-tw": " It's been well-describedand well-observed in primates, but you also see it in rats, and wherever you find it -- humans, primates, rats -- you find it associatedwith things like tickling. That's the same for humans.", "en": " 靈長類的這種現象已有很完整的觀察和紀錄， 但是你也能在老鼠身上看到， 不管你在哪裡看到 ──人類、靈長類、老鼠── 都會發現這和搔癢這類的事件有關係。 人類也一樣。"}, {"zh-tw": " You find it associated with play,and all mammals play. And wherever you find it,it's associated with interactions.", "en": " 你會發現這和玩樂有關，所有的哺乳類都會玩樂。 不論你在哪裡看到，這都和互動有關。"}, {"zh-tw": " So Robert Provine, who has donea lot of work on this, has pointed out that you are 30 times more likely to laugh if you are with somebody elsethan if you're on your own, and where you find most laughter is in social interactionslike conversation. So if you ask human beings,\"When do you laugh?\" they'll talk about comedy and they'll talkabout humor and they'll talk about jokes.", "en": " 羅伯特．普范對這做過很多研究， 他指出當你跟別人在一起的時候， 你笑的機會比你獨自一人的時候多 30 倍， 你聽到最多笑聲的地方， 是在有社會互動的時候，像是對話。 如果你問人類：「你什麼時候會笑？」 他們會說到喜劇、會說到幽默、會說到笑話。"}, {"zh-tw": " If you look at when they laugh,they're laughing with their friends. And when we laugh with people, we'rehardly ever actually laughing at jokes.", "en": " 當你觀察他們什麼時候笑，他們是與朋友一同歡笑。 當我們與人同樂的時候，我們幾乎不是因為笑話而笑，"}, {"zh-tw": " You are laughing to show peoplethat you understand them, that you agree with them, that you'repart of the same group as them. You're laughing to showthat you like them.", "en": " 你用笑來表達你了解他們， 表示你同意他們，表示你是團體的一份子。 你用笑來表示你喜歡他們。"}, {"zh-tw": " You might even love them. You're doing all that at the same timeas talking to them, and the laughter is doing a lotof that emotional work for you.", "en": " 甚至是愛他們。 你在和他們說話的同時也做出上述所有的事。 笑幫助你表達這樣的情緒。"}, {"zh-tw": " Something that Robert Provinehas pointed out, as you can see here, and the reason why we were laughing when we heard thosefunny laughs at the start, and why I was laughingwhen I found my parents laughing, is that it's an enormouslybehaviorally contagious effect. You can catch laughter from somebody else, and you are more likely to catch laughteroff somebody else if you know them.", "en": " 羅伯特．普凡說過，如同你在此所見， 我們在開頭聽到滑稽笑聲跟著笑的原因， 還有我在聽到我父母笑而跟著笑的原因， 是因為這是一種極具傳染性的行為。 你會因別人笑而跟著笑， 如果你認識笑的那個人，你跟著笑的機率更高。 這依然受到社會脈絡的控制。"}, {"zh-tw": " So it's still modulatedby this social context. You have to put humor to one side and think about the social meaning of laughter because that's where its origins lie.", "en": " 你得把幽默感放一邊， 然後去思考笑的社會意義， 因為那是笑的根本來源。"}, {"zh-tw": " Now, something I've got very interested inis different kinds of laughter, and we have some neurobiological evidenceabout how human beings vocalize that suggests there might betwo kinds of laughs that we have. So it seems possible that the neurobiologyfor helpless, involuntary laughter, like my parents lying on the floorscreaming about a silly song, might have a different basis to itthan some of that more polite social laughter that you encounter,which isn't horrible laughter, but it's behavior somebody is doingas part of their communicative act to you, part of their interaction with you;they are choosing to do this.", "en": " 我對各種不同的笑很有興趣， 根據神經生物學關於人類如何發聲的證據， 學者提出笑分成兩種。 這意味著在神經生物學上，不由自主、無法控制的笑， 就像我父母因為一首滑稽的歌笑倒在地上尖叫， 可能和你所見到的社交禮儀上的笑有不同的根源， 這種禮貌的笑並不可怕， 而是他們對你表現社交的一部分， 是和你互動的一部分；他們選擇這麼做。"}, {"zh-tw": " In our evolution, we have developedtwo different ways of vocalizing. Involuntary vocalizationsare part of an older system than the more voluntary vocalizationslike the speech I'm doing now.", "en": " 我們在演化過程中發展出兩種發聲方式。 非自主的發聲屬於較古老系統， 比自主性的發聲系統還老，我現在演講就是自主性發聲。"}, {"zh-tw": " So we might imagine that laughtermight actually have two different roots. So I've been looking at thisin more detail.", "en": " 我們可以想像笑有兩個不同的根源。 於是我深入研究。"}, {"zh-tw": " To do this, we've had to makerecordings of people laughing, and we've had to do whatever it takesto make people laugh, and we got those same peopleto produce more posed, social laughter. So imagine your friend told a joke, and you're laughing becauseyou like your friend, but not really becausethe joke's all that.", "en": " 為了研究，我們得錄製人們的笑聲， 我們也必須想盡辦法讓人們笑， 我們也設法讓同一群人產生更做作、社交式的笑。 想像你朋友說了一個笑話， 然後你笑了，因為你喜歡你朋友， 並不是因為笑話本身好笑。"}, {"zh-tw": " So I'm going to play you a couple of those. I want you to tell me if you thinkthis laughter is real laughter, or if you think it's posed.", "en": " 我要放幾段給你們聽。 我希望你們告訴我你們覺得這是真的在笑， 還是做做樣子。"}, {"zh-tw": " So is this involuntary laughteror more voluntary laughter? (Audio: Laughing) What does that sound like to you? Audience: Posed.Sophie Scott: Posed? Posed. How about this one? (Audio: Laughing) I'm the best.", "en": " 這是自然發笑還是刻意的笑？ （音訊：笑聲） 你們覺得聽起來如何？ 聽眾：做做樣子。蘇菲．史考特：做做樣子？沒錯。 那這個呢？ （音訊：笑） 我最會笑了。"}, {"zh-tw": " Not really. No, that was helpless laughter, and in fact, to record that,all they had to do was record me watching one of my friends listening tosomething I knew she wanted to laugh at, and I just started doing this.", "en": " 開玩笑的。 那是無法控制的笑。 事實上要錄這段，他們只需要錄下 我看我的朋友聽一段我知道她一定會笑的東西， 我就笑成這樣了。"}, {"zh-tw": " What you find is that peopleare good at telling the difference between real and posed laughter. They seem to be different things to us.", "en": " 你會發現人們其實很能分辨 真笑與假笑。 兩種笑對我們來說是不同的。"}, {"zh-tw": " Interestingly, you see somethingquite similar with chimpanzees. Chimpanzees laugh differentlyif they're being tickled than if they're playing with each other, and we might be seeingsomething like that here, involuntary laughter, tickling laughter,being different from social laughter.", "en": " 有趣的是，你在大猩猩身上也能觀察到類似現象。 大猩猩在被搔癢時候 和在玩的時候，笑的方式不一樣， 在這裡我們也能看到類似情形， 自然發笑、搔癢的笑，和社交的笑是不同的。 聽起來就很不一樣。"}, {"zh-tw": " They're acoustically very different. The real laughs are longer.They're higher in pitch.", "en": " 真正的笑持續較久，音調較高。 你用力笑的時候，"}, {"zh-tw": " When you start laughing hard, you start squeezing air outfrom your lungs under much higher pressuresthan you could ever produce voluntarily. For example, I could neverpitch my voice that high to sing.", "en": " 你會把空氣擠出你的肺， 這比你故意做的任何動作產生的壓力都還要大。 例如，我絕對無法用那麼高的音調來唱歌。"}, {"zh-tw": " Also, you start to get these sort ofcontractions and weird whistling sounds, all of which mean that real laughteris extremely easy, or feels extremely easy to spot. In contrast, posed laughter,we might think it sounds a bit fake.", "en": " 你也會有類似這種收縮和奇怪的哨聲， 這些都意味著真的笑很容易， 或讓人覺得很容易分辨。 相反的，做作的笑，我們可能認為這聽起來有點假。"}, {"zh-tw": " Actually, it's not, it's actuallyan important social cue. We use it a lot, we're choosingto laugh in a lot of situations, and it seems to be its own thing.", "en": " 其實並非如此。這種笑真的是很重要的社交線索。 我們很常使用，我們在許多場合中選擇笑， 而且這種笑聲似乎很獨特。"}, {"zh-tw": " So, for example, you findnasality in posed laughter, that kind of \"ha ha ha ha ha\" sound that you never get, you could not do,if you were laughing involuntarily. So they do seem to be genuinelythese two different sorts of things.", "en": " 舉個例子，你在做作的笑中發現鼻音， 那種像「哈哈哈哈」的音， 你永遠無法在非自主性的笑中聽到或發出這種聲音。 這兩種不同的東西似乎都很真實。"}, {"zh-tw": " We took it into the scannerto see how brains respond when you hear laughter. And when you do this,this is a really boring experiment.", "en": " 我們以掃描器看腦部在我們聽到笑聲時的反應。 做這個實驗真的是無聊到極點，"}, {"zh-tw": " We just played peoplereal and posed laughs. We didn't tell themit was a study on laughter.", "en": " 我們就是播放人真笑與假笑的聲音。 我們沒有告訴他們這是對笑聲的研究。"}, {"zh-tw": " We put other sounds in there to distract them, and all they're doingis lying listening to sounds. We don't tell them to do anything.", "en": " 我們同時還播放其他的聲音讓他們分心， 他們要做的就是躺在那裡聽。 我們不告訴他們要做什麼。"}, {"zh-tw": " Nonetheless, when you hear real laughterand when you hear posed laughter, the brains are respondingcompletely differently, significantly differently. What you see in the regions in blue,which lies in auditory cortex, are the brain areas that respondmore to the real laughs, and what seems to be the case, when you hear somebodylaughing involuntarily, you hear sounds you would neverhear in any other context.", "en": " 然而，你聽到真笑與假笑的時候， 腦部的反應迥然不同， 顯著不同。 你們看到這塊藍色的區域，位於聽覺皮質， 是腦部對真笑有較多反應的地方， 情況似乎是這樣， 當你聽到非自主的笑時， 你會聽到在其他情況下都不會聽到的聲音。"}, {"zh-tw": " It's very unambiguous, and it seems to be associatedwith greater auditory processing of these novel sounds. In contrast, when you hear somebodylaughing in a posed way, what you see are these regions in pink, which are occupying brain areasassociated with mentalizing, thinking about whatsomebody else is thinking.", "en": " 這非常明確， 這可能與要處理這些新聲音 需要更大的聽覺處理歷程有關。 相反的，聽到做作的笑聲時， 你看到的是這塊粉紅色區域， 位於大腦與心智化有關的區域， 思索著別人在想什麼。"}, {"zh-tw": " And I think what that means is, even if you're having your brain scanned,which is completely boring and not very interesting, when you hear somebody going,\"A ha ha ha ha ha,\" you're trying to work outwhy they're laughing. Laughter is always meaningful.", "en": " 我想這意味著， 即使你正在掃描大腦，這是件極其無聊、 沒什麼樂趣的事， 當你聽到有人「呵呵呵呵」笑時， 你仍然想搞懂他們為什麼笑。 笑聲永遠都有意義。"}, {"zh-tw": " You are always tryingto understand it in context, even if, as far as you are concerned,at that point in time, it has not necessarilyanything to do with you, you still want to knowwhy those people are laughing. Now, we've had the opportunity to look at how people hear real and posed laughter across the age range.", "en": " 你總是想知道背後的情境是什麼， 即使在那個當下，在你關心的範圍內， 那個笑與你一點關係都沒有， 你還是很想知道為什麼這些人在笑。 我們有機會看不同年齡層的人 如何聽真笑與假笑。"}, {"zh-tw": " So this is an online experimentwe ran with the Royal Society, and here we just asked peopletwo questions. First of all, they heard some laughs, and they had to say, how real or posed do these laughs sound? The real laughs are shown in redand the posed laughs are shown in blue.", "en": " 這是個網路實驗，我們與皇家學會合作， 我們在實驗中只問大家兩個問題。 第一，他們聽到一些笑聲， 他們必須說出這些笑聲有多真或多假？ 真的笑聲以紅色顯示，假笑則以藍色顯示。 你可以看見有一段快速開展期。"}, {"zh-tw": " What you see is there is a rapid onset. As you get older, you get betterand better at spotting real laughter.", "en": " 隨著年齡增長，你辨識真笑的能力愈來愈好。"}, {"zh-tw": " So six-year-olds are at chance,they can't really hear the difference. By the time you are older, you get better, but interestingly, you do not hitpeak performance in this dataset until you are in yourlate 30s and early 40s.", "en": " 所以六歲小孩幾乎聽不出差別。 到你長大一點，你表現就好一點， 但有意思的是，這組資料集顯示 你要到 30 好幾 40 出頭才會達到顛峰。"}, {"zh-tw": " You don't understand laughter fullyby the time you hit puberty. You don't understand laughter fullyby the time your brain has matured at the end of your teens.", "en": " 青春期開始時你對於笑聲不甚了解。 青春期結束，你的大腦成熟後， 對於笑聲還是不甚了解。"}, {"zh-tw": " You're learning about laughterthroughout your entire early adult life. If we turn the question around and now saynot, what does the laughter sound like in terms of being realor posed, but we say, how much does this laughtermake you want to laugh, how contagious is this laughter to you,we see a different profile.", "en": " 你要花整段成年初期來學習笑聲。 如果我們把問題反過來問，我們不問這笑聲是真是假， 但我們說， 這段笑聲讓你有多想笑， 這段笑聲對你多有傳染力，我們會看到不同的圖。"}, {"zh-tw": " And here, the younger you are, the more you want to join inwhen you hear laughter. Remember me laughing with my parentswhen I had no idea what was going on.", "en": " 這裡，你愈年輕， 就愈想在聽到笑聲時加入笑的行列。 記得我跟我父母一起大笑，卻完全搞不清楚發生什麼事嗎？"}, {"zh-tw": " You really can see this. Now everybody, young and old, finds the real laughs more contagiousthan the posed laughs, but as you get older, it all becomes less contagious to you.", "en": " 你會發現測驗結果確實如此。 每一個人，無論年紀大小， 都會發現真的笑比假的笑更具傳染力， 但是隨著年齡增長，笑聲對你愈來愈不具傳染力。"}, {"zh-tw": " Now, either we're all just becomingreally grumpy as we get older, or it may mean that as youunderstand laughter better, and you are getting better at doing that, you need more than justhearing people laugh to want to laugh. You need the social stuff there.", "en": " 要不就是我們真的愈老愈難搞， 要不就是你愈來愈明白笑聲的含意， 因為你對此愈來愈嫻熟， 你不僅再聽人笑就笑，你還需要知道更多。 你需要知道實際的社交情況。"}, {"zh-tw": " So we've got a very interesting behavior about which a lot of ourlay assumptions are incorrect, but I'm coming to see that actuallythere's even more to laughter than it's an important social emotionwe should look at, because it turns outpeople are phenomenally nuanced in terms of how we use laughter. There's a really lovelyset of studies coming out from Robert Levenson's lab in California, where he's doinga longitudinal study with couples.", "en": " 所以我們看到非常有意思的行為現象， 與我們外行人的臆測不謀而合， 但是我開始瞭解到其實笑聲 不僅是我們應該研究的重要社交情緒， 因為事實證明大家運用笑聲的方式 微妙得驚人。 有一組非常棒的研究資料 由拉文森在加州的實驗室發表， 他在實驗室裡對夫婦做長期追蹤。"}, {"zh-tw": " He gets married couples,men and women, into the lab, and he gives themstressful conversations to have while he wires them up to a polygraphso he can see them becoming stressed. So you've got the two of them in there,and he'll say to the husband, \"Tell me something that your wife doesthat irritates you.\" And what you see is immediately -- just run that one through your headbriefly, you and your partner -- you can imagine everybody gets a bitmore stressed as soon as that starts.", "en": " 他把已婚夫婦帶進實驗室， 並提出讓他們緊張的話題， 同時將他們接上波動描寫器，觀察他們變得多緊張。 所以兩個人坐在那裡，然後他跟丈夫說： 「告訴我你太太做什麼會惹你生氣。」 你立刻就會看到 ──就在你腦海裡想像一下，你和你的另一半── 你能想像到這個實驗一開始，每個人都會有點緊張。"}, {"zh-tw": " You can see physically,people become more stressed. What he finds is that the coupleswho manage that feeling of stress with laughter,positive emotions like laughter, not only immediately become less stressed, they can see themphysically feeling better, they're dealing with thisunpleasant situation better together, they are also the couples that report high levels of satisfactionin their relationship and they stay together for longer.", "en": " 你能從生理現象看到大家都變更緊張了。 他發現到能以笑帶過緊張情緒的夫婦， 正面的情緒如笑聲， 不但立刻變得不那麼緊張， 他們在生理上感覺更好， 他們更能一同面對這種不愉快的情況， 他們也是在婚姻關係中 有高滿意度的夫婦， 所以他們的婚姻維持更久。"}, {"zh-tw": " So in fact, when you lookat close relationships, laughter is a phenomenally useful index of how people are regulatingtheir emotions together. We're not just emitting it at each otherto show that we like each other, we're making ourselvesfeel better together.", "en": " 所以事實上，如果你去看親密關係， 會發現笑聲是很有用的指標， 顯示人如何一起調整情緒。 我們不但藉由互相抒發情緒來顯示我們喜歡彼此， 我們還因此讓自己更自在。"}, {"zh-tw": " Now, I don't think this is goingto be limited to romantic relationships. I think this is probablygoing to be a characteristic of close emotional relationshipssuch as you might have with friends, which explains my next clip, which is of a YouTube video of someyoung men in the former East Germany on making a video to promotetheir heavy metal band, and it's extremely macho,and the mood is very serious, and I want you to noticewhat happens in terms of laughter when things go wrong and how quickly that happens,and how that changes the mood.", "en": " 我想這並不限於浪漫的關係。 這也應該是項特質， 存在於情緒親密的關係中，如你與朋友的關係， 這也解釋了我的下一段影片， 這段 YouTube 影片，是一些前東德的年輕人 在製作他們重金屬樂團的宣傳短片， 超男子氣概，氣氛超嚴肅， 我要你們注意一下在情況有異時， 笑聲的變化， 注意一下這發生得多快，又如何改變氣氛。"}, {"zh-tw": " He's cold. He's about to get wet.He's got swimming trunks on, got a towel. Ice.", "en": " 他很冷。他快要下水了。他穿著泳褲， 有條毛巾。 冰。"}, {"zh-tw": " What might possibly happen? Video starts. Serious mood.", "en": " 到底發生了什麼？ 影片開始。 氣氛嚴肅。"}, {"zh-tw": " And his friends are already laughing.They are already laughing, hard. He's not laughing yet.", "en": " 他的朋友已經開始笑了起來。他們已經笑得很大聲了。 他還沒開始笑。"}, {"zh-tw": " He's starting to go now. And now they're all off.", "en": " 他要笑了。 現在他們都笑翻了。"}, {"zh-tw": " They're on the floor. The thing I really like about thatis it's all very serious until he jumps onto the ice, andas soon as he doesn't go through the ice, but also there isn't bloodand bone everywhere, his friends start laughing.", "en": " 他們笑倒在地上。 我最喜歡的部分，是這原本非常嚴肅， 直到他跳進冰裡，但是沒有真的掉進去， 而且影片中沒有頭破血流， 他的朋友就笑了起來。"}, {"zh-tw": " And imagine if that had played him outwith him standing there going, \"No seriously, Heinrich,I think this is broken,\" we wouldn't enjoy watching that.That would be stressful. Or if he was running aroundwith a visibly broken leg laughing, and his friends are going, \"Heinrich, Ithink we need to go to the hospital now,\" that also wouldn't be funny.", "en": " 想像一下，如果他皮開肉綻站起來說： 「說真的，亨利，我想這裡斷了。」 我們就不會這麼喜歡看這個。這可能會很緊張。 或是如果他明顯拖著斷腿邊到處跑還邊笑， 而且他的朋友說：「亨利，我想我們現在得去趟醫院，」 那就不會這麼好笑了。 事實上笑在這裡起了作用，"}, {"zh-tw": " The fact that the laughter works, it gets him from a painful,embarrassing, difficult situation, into a funny situation, into what we're actually enjoying there, and I think that's a really interesting use, and it's actually happening all the time. For example, I can remembersomething like this happening at my father's funeral.", "en": " 笑讓他避開痛苦、尷尬、困難的情況， 變成有趣的局面，我們其實還挺喜歡的， 我想這個用法真的很有意思， 而且這其實還時時發生。 舉一個例子，我還記得類似的情況 在我父親的葬禮上出現。 我們沒有穿著內褲在冰上跳來跳去。"}, {"zh-tw": " We weren't jumping aroundon the ice in our underpants. We're not Canadian.", "en": " 我們不是加拿大人。 （譯註：加拿大有新年冬泳傳統，本大會現場在加拿大。）"}, {"zh-tw": " These events are always difficult, I hada relative who was being a bit difficult, my mum was not in a good place, and I can remember finding myselfjust before the whole thing started telling this story about somethingthat happened in a 1970s sitcom, and I just thought at the time,I don't know why I'm doing this, and what I realized I was doing was I was coming up withsomething from somewhere I could use to make her laughtogether with me. It was a very basic reactionto find some reason we can do this.", "en": " 這樣的場合總是難熬，我有個親戚變得有點難伺候， 我媽媽的狀況也不好， 我還記得就在葬禮開始前，我發現自己 在說 1970 年代某個情境喜劇的劇情， 那時候我還在想，我幹嘛在這時候做這個， 我意識到我在做的 是我想以此神來之舉， 讓她跟我一起笑一笑。 這是非常基本的反應，"}, {"zh-tw": " We can laugh together.We're going to get through this.
