And what if we go back beyond that single ancestor, when there was presumably a competition among many languages? How far back does that go? How far back does modern language go? How many tens of thousands of years does it go back? Chris Anderson: Do you have a hunch or a hope for what the answer to that is? Murray Gell-Mann: Well, I would guess that modern language must be older than the cave paintings and cave engravings and cave sculptures and dance steps in the soft clay in the caves in Western Europe, in the Aurignacian Period some 35,000 years ago, or earlier. I can't believe they did all those things and didn't also have a modern language.", "en": " 我們口中的語言真的會被導回兩萬、或兩萬五千年前 的同一個始祖嗎？ 那如果我們再往那個共祖往前推又會怎樣？ 那時大概會是許多語言之間的競爭吧！ 那是在多久之前呢？近代的語言可追溯到多久以前？ 是在幾萬年前？ 克里斯‧安德森：你的直覺能帶給你找出這個問題的答案嗎？ 莫瑞：唔，我猜比起洞穴中的圖畫、銘刻、雕塑 或是西歐洞穴中軟泥上的舞步, 那是在歐里納克（譯按：舊石器時代晚期〕時期，約莫三萬五千年前，或甚至更早 或是西歐洞穴中軟泥上的舞步, 那是在歐里納克（譯按：舊石器時代晚期〕時期，約莫三萬五千年前，甚至更早 近代的語言一定比它們都更為古老 我不相信他們會在沒有近代語言之下建立出這一切"}, {"zh-tw": " So, I would guess that the actual origin goes back at least that far and maybe further.
