That was after having spent about 20 years together with African institutionsstudying hunger in Africa, so I was sort of expectedto know a little about the world."}, {"zh-tw": "在我們的Karolinska醫學院我開設了一門本科生課程“全球健康”剛開課的時候我還有些緊張", "en": "And I started in our medical university,Karolinska Institute, an undergraduate coursecalled Global Health. But when you get that opportunity,you get a little nervous."}, {"zh-tw": "因為來聽課的都是瑞典大學的優等生他們或許早已了解我準備教的內容於是在第一堂課裡，我作了一個小測試", "en": "I thought, these students coming to us actually have the highest gradeyou can get in Swedish college systems -- so I thought, maybe they know everythingI'm going to teach them about. So I did a pre-test when they came."}, {"zh-tw": "其中有一道題讓我受益匪淺下列5對國家中，哪一個的兒童死亡率高於另一個？我所選擇的配對國家都是一個的兒童死亡率是另一個的兩倍數據本身的不確定性可以忽略不計", "en": "And one of the questionsfrom which I learned a lot was this one: \"Which country has the highestchild mortality of these five pairs?\" I put them together,so that in each pair of country, one has twice the childmortality of the other.

That means that there was a placefor a professor of international health and for my course."}, {"zh-tw": "但後來有天深夜，當我寫總結報告的時候我突然有了新的發現瑞典大學的優等生們對世界的了解竟然還不如黑猩猩", "en": "But one late night,when I was compiling the report, I really realized my discovery. I have shown that Swedish top students know statistically significantly lessabout the world than the chimpanzees."}, {"zh-tw": "因為黑猩猩們至少能蒙對一半在兩個選項旁邊各放一根香蕉，就有一半的機率答對。", "en": "Because the chimpanzeewould score half right if I gave them two bananaswith Sri Lanka and Turkey. They would be right half of the cases.But the students are not there."}, {"zh-tw": "這些優等生們卻做不到。這不是由於知識缺乏而是他們先入為主的錯誤理念我還把這個測試拿去給卡羅林斯卡學院的教授們做他們每年負責頒發諾貝爾醫學獎結果教授們和黑猩猩半斤八兩", "en": "The problem for me was not ignorance;it was preconceived ideas.

We think about aid, like these people here giving aidto these people here."}, {"zh-tw": "其實中間這部分才是世界人口的主體，而他們僅得到全部收入的24%這是個老問題了，中間這些人是誰？他們在哪些國家？先看非洲", "en": "But in the middle, we havemost of the world population, and they have now24 percent of the income.
