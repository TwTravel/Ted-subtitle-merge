It's not just taking a pilland performance or pain improving; it's about our beliefs and expectations,the cultural meaning of a treatment.", "en": " 當然，還有安慰劑的影響 安慰劑的效果是所有藥品中，最令人神往的一個 不是吃藥而已，然後你的表現變好，疼痛舒緩如此而已 是我們的信念，以及期望 這就是治療的文化定譯"}, {"zh-tw": " And this has been demonstratedin a whole raft of fascinating studies comparing one kind of placeboagainst another.

What I've just shown you are examples of the very simpleand straightforward ways that journalists and food supplementpill peddlers and naturopaths can distort evidencefor their own purposes.", "en": " 但，這樣是不夠的 目前為止，我給你們看的實驗例子的方法，都很簡單易懂 簡單到記者、食物供應商、糖果小販 以及自然療法醫生 都可以根據他們自己的目的，來曲解證據"}, {"zh-tw": " What I find really fascinating is that the pharmaceutical industryuses exactly the same kinds of tricks and devices, but slightly more sophisticatedversions of them, in order to distort the evidencethey give to doctors and patients, and which we use to makevitally important decisions. So firstly, trials against placebo: everybody thinks a trialshould be a comparison of your new drug against placebo.", "en": " 令我相當驚訝的 是那些醫藥工業 他們使用相同的方法、設備 只不過把證據扭曲成較複雜的版本 而醫生及病人，都根據那些扭曲的證據 做出攸關性命的重要決定 首先，大家都認為 一個和安慰劑對照的實驗，應該是 拿新藥品和安慰劑來相比較 但，在很多情況下，這樣的方法是錯的"}, {"zh-tw": " But in a lot of situations that's wrong; often, we already have a good treatmentcurrently available.

You can also rig your data by making the thing you compareyour new drug against really rubbish.", "en": " 你還可以把和新藥品要比較的物品 弄得像垃圾一樣 毫無價值"}, {"zh-tw": " You can give the competing drugin too low a dose, so people aren't properly treated. You can give the competing drugin too high a dose, so people get side effects.", "en": " 在使用競爭者的藥品時，你也可以只給予很少的劑量， 而人們自然沒有辦法治療好 或是你把劑量提高 這樣就會產生副作用"}, {"zh-tw": " And this is exactly what happened with antipsychotic medicationfor schizophrenia.

But they gave the old drugsin ridiculously high doses: 20 milligrams a day of haloperidol.", "en": " 所以人們就開始拿這些新的藥物和舊的藥物 做實驗比較 但，他們卻把舊的藥物劑量提高很多－ 一天要吃20毫克的施寧錠(抗精神病藥物)"}, {"zh-tw": " And it's a foregone conclusionif you give a drug at that high a dose, it will have more side effects,and your new drug will look better. Ten years ago, history repeated itself, when risperidone, the firstof the new-generation antipsychotic drugs, came off copyright,so anybody could make copies.", "en": " 結論可想而知 要是你把一種藥物的劑量開這麼高 它的副作用當然比新的藥物還要多 過去十年，歷史不斷重演。有趣的是 當那一批抗精神病藥品，像是理思必妥 產權到期時，人人都可以自己做這些藥物"}, {"zh-tw": " Everybody wanted to show their drugwas better than risperidone, so you see trials comparingnew antipsychotic drugs against risperidoneat eight milligrams a day. Again, not an insane dose,not an illegal dose, but very much at the high end of normal.", "en": " 大家想證明，他們自己做的藥比理思必妥還好 所以你會看到，有一堆的抗精神病藥物 拿來和一天八毫克的理思必妥做比較 八毫克不是多得很瘋狂，也沒有超出合法劑量 但幾乎游走在法律邊緣了"}, {"zh-tw": " So you're bound to makeyour new drug look better. And so it's no surprise that overall, industry-funded trialsare four times more likely to give a positive result than independently sponsored trials.", "en": " 所以，你自己做的藥物當然比那些藥來的好 果不其然 藥商贊助的實驗 比那些獨立出資的實驗，得到陽性結果 機率高出四倍"}, {"zh-tw": " But -- and it's a big but -- it turns out, when you look at the methodsused by industry-funded trials, that they're actually betterthan independently sponsored trials. And yet, they always manageto get the result that they want.", "en": " 但是，但但但但是 最後卻發現 那些藥商贊助實驗所使用的方法 確實是比獨立出資的實驗 要來的好 儘管如此，他們仍設法去得到他們想要的結果"}, {"zh-tw": " So how does this work? How can we explainthis strange phenomenon? Well, it turns out that what happens is the negative datagoes missing in action; it's withheld from doctors and patients. And this is the most importantaspect of the whole story.", "en": " 怎麼做？ 這樣如此奇怪的現象該如何解釋？ 原來，那些負面的數據 在實驗進行中被隱匿起來。 醫生和病人都不知情 而這正是整件事情的重點所在 證據都在這裡"}, {"zh-tw": " It's at the topof the pyramid of evidence. We need to have all of the dataon a particular treatment to know whether or notit really is effective.", "en": " 任一特定的療法，我們需要所有的資訊 來知道該療法是否有效 而有兩種不同的方法可以讓你知道"}, {"zh-tw": " There are two different ways you can spotwhether some data has gone missing.
