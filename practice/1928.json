That's what I'd like to share with you.", "en": " 以詩人亨利·沃茲沃思·朗費羅的話說: \"人類的聲音就是靈魂的器官.\" 做為一個語言科學家, 我對聲音產生的過程 有著濃厚的興趣, 我對如何來設計與建造聲音有一個新的看法 我想和大家分享的這個看法"}, {"zh-tw": " I'm going to start by playing you a sample of a voice that you may recognize.

In fact, all of these individuals may be using the same voice, and that's because there'sonly a few options available.", "en": " 但是你也許不知道同一個聲音 也可能被這個小女孩使用 她因為神經的問題 而無法說話 事實上, 所有這些人 都可能用著同一個聲音, 因為目前可用的聲音只有幾個"}, {"zh-tw": " In the U.S. alone, there are 2.5 million Americans who are unable to speak, and many of whom use computerized devices to communicate. Now that's millions of people worldwide who are using generic voices, including Professor Hawking, who uses an American-accented voice.", "en": " 僅在美國就有250萬人 無法通過語言溝通, 他們大多數 使用電子設備來溝通 這意味著全世界有數百萬的人 都用著同樣的聲音, 其中包括了霍金教授, 他用的是帶有美式口音的聲音"}, {"zh-tw": " This lack of individuation of the synthetic voice really hit home when I was at an assistive technology conference a few years ago, and I recall walking into an exhibit hall and seeing a little girl and a grown man having a conversation using their devices, different devices, but the same voice. And I looked around and I saw this happening all around me, literally hundreds of individuals using a handful of voices, voices that didn't fit their bodies or their personalities.", "en": " 這種人工聲音缺少的個體性 讓我非常的驚訝, 當我幾年前 在一個輔具科技會議上, 我記得走進一個展覽廳 看見一個小女孩和一個成年男子 通過他們的設備談話, 雖然設備不同, 但聲音卻是一樣的 我望了望四周,發現 周圍有幾百個人 使用的聲音却只有幾種 都不符合他們的身體 或是性格."}, {"zh-tw": " We wouldn't dream of fitting a little girl with the prosthetic limb of a grown man.

It really struck me, and I wanted to do something about this.", "en": " 我們不會考慮給一個小女孩裝上 一個成年男子的假肢 那為甚麼要給她一個不屬於自己的聲音呢? 我因為感觸很深, 所以決定對此做些甚麼"}, {"zh-tw": " I'm going to play you now a sample of someone who has, two people actually, who have severe speech disorders.

We set out with a little bit of fundingfrom the National Science Foundation, to create custom-crafted voices that captured their unique vocal identities.", "en": " 所以我們決定就這樣做 我們從國家科學基金會獲得了一些資金, 用以建造一套可以抓住他們 聲音特性的個體化語音"}, {"zh-tw": " We call this project VocaliD, or vocal I.D., for vocal identity. Now before I get into the details of how the voice is made and let you listen to it, I need to give you a real quickspeech science lesson. Okay? So first, we know that the voice is changing dramatically over the course of development.", "en": " 我們將該專案稱作VocaliD, 或是vocal I.D., 作為語音身份(Vocal Identity)的簡寫 在我向大家播放 和介紹如何製作這個聲音之前, 我需要先給大家上一堂語言科學課, 好嗎? 首先,我們需要了解聲音 在成長的過程中會發生巨大的變化"}, {"zh-tw": " Children sound different from teens who sound different from adults. We've all experienced this.", "en": " 兒童和青少年聽起來會不同 而青少年和成年人之間也是 我們都曾經歷過這些語言變化階段"}, {"zh-tw": " Fact number two is that speech is a combination of the source, which is the vibrations generated by your voice box, which are then pushed through the rest of the vocal tract. These are the chambers of your head and neck that vibrate, and they actually filter that source sound to produce consonants and vowels.", "en": " 事實二，是語言的產生 是由多個來源組成, 其中包括了你喉頭產生的顫動, 這種顫動接著 會貫穿整個聲腔 圖像顯示的是頭和脖子的內部 它們會顫動, 其實它們是將來源聲音過濾掉 來產生子音和母音"}, {"zh-tw": " So the combination of source and filter is how we produce speech. And that happens in one individual.", "en": " 所以聲音的來源和過濾過程加在一起 就是我們產生聲音的方法 這是一個人身上發生的過程"}, {"zh-tw": " Now I told you earlier that I'd spent a good part of my career understanding and studying the source characteristics of people with severe speech disorder, and what I've found is that even though their filters were impaired, they were able to modulate their source: the pitch, the loudness, the tempo of their voice. These are called prosody, andI've been documenting for years that the prosodic abilities of these individuals are preserved.", "en": " 我之前告訴過大家 我職業生涯的大部分時間 都用來研究和學習 有嚴重語音障礙人士的 聲音源的特徵, 我發現 雖然他們的過濾器官已遭到損壞, 他們可以調製自己的聲音來源: 包括高低度, 大小, 以及速度 這些被稱之為音律, 我用了多年的時間來紀錄這些人是如何 維持自己音律的能力"}, {"zh-tw": " So when I realized that those same cues are also important for speaker identity, I had this idea. Why don't we take the source from the person we want the voice to sound like, because it's preserved, and borrow the filter from someone about the same age and size, because they can articulate speech, and then mix them? Because when we mix them, we can get a voice that's as clear as our surrogate talker -- that's the person we borrowed the filter from— and is similar in identity to our target talker.", "en": " 當我認識到同樣的線索 對說話人的身份同樣重要的時候, 我有了一個想法 為什麼我們不找一個聲音是我們所需要的人, 從他那採集聲音源 因為它已被保留, 然後再找一個有著相似年紀和體型的人 從他那借用過濾器, 因為他們能清晰地說話, 然後將二者混合? 因為當我們將它們混合的時候, 我們得到的聲音將會和 那個代替說話者一樣清楚 代替說話者就是我們借用過濾器的人 而產生的語音和我們目標說話者有相似的辨認度"}, {"zh-tw": " It's that simple. That's the science behind what we're doing.", "en": " 就這麼簡單 這就我們該項研究的科學性"}, {"zh-tw": " So once you have that in mind, how do you go about building this voice? Well, you have to find someone who is willing to be a surrogate. It's not such an ominous thing.", "en": " 有了這個想法以後, 應該怎麼來製造這個聲音呢? 首先,你必須找一個 願意當這個代替者的人 這個任務也不是太糟糕"}, {"zh-tw": " Being a surrogate donor only requires you to say a few hundred to a few thousand utterances. The process goes something like this.", "en": " 當一個聲音捐贈者 只要求你閱讀幾百 到幾千句話. 以下是過程"}, {"zh-tw": " (Video) Voice: Things happen in pairs. I love to sleep.", "en": " (錄影)聲音: 事情成雙成對地發生 我愛睡覺"}, {"zh-tw": " The sky is blue without clouds. RP: Now she's going to go on like this for about three to four hours, and the idea is not for her to say everything that the target is going to want to say, but the idea is to cover all the different combinations of the sounds that occur in the language.", "en": " 天空藍色無雲 演講者: 她接下來的3-4個小時 都會繼續閱讀, 目的是不要讓她說 所有目標說話者要說的話 真正的目的是要概擴所有 在語言中可能發生的組合"}, {"zh-tw": " The more speech you have, the better sounding voice you're going to have. Once you have those recordings, what we need to do is we have to parse these recordings into little snippets of speech, one- or two-sound combinations, sometimes even whole words that start populating a dataset or a database.", "en": " 你說的話越多, 你的聲音就會聽起來更好 當錄音完成後, 我們接下來 要對這些錄音做語法分析 將它們分段, 大概1-2個音的組合, 有時候也會是那些 填入數據集或是數據庫的完整單字"}, {"zh-tw": " We're going to call this database a voice bank. Now the power of the voice bank is that from this voice bank, we can now say any new utterance, like, \"I love chocolate\" -- everyone needs to be able to say that— fish through that database and find all the segments necessary to say that utterance.", "en": " 我們將這個數據庫稱之為聲音銀行 聲音銀行的力量 使我們通過它 可以說出任何新的語句, 比如說, \"我喜歡巧克力\" 所有人都需要說這類的話的能力 搜尋數據庫 找到必須的部分 來完成這個語句"}, {"zh-tw": " (Video) Voice: I love chocolate. RP: So that's speech synthesis.", "en": " (錄影)聲音: 我喜歡巧克力 演講人: 這是一個人工聲音"}, {"zh-tw": " It's called concatenative synthesis,and that's what we're using. That's not the novel part.", "en": " 我們將其稱之為連環整合我們使用的就是這個方法 這不是新奇的部分"}, {"zh-tw": " What's novel is how we make it sound like this young woman. This is Samantha.", "en": " 它新奇之處是我們使它 聽起來就像是這個年輕女士的聲音 她是珊曼莎"}, {"zh-tw": " I met her when she was nine, and since then, my team and I have been trying to build her a personalized voice. We first had to find a surrogate donor, and then we had to have Samantha produce some utterances.", "en": " 在她9歲時, 我第一次見到她 在那之後, 我和我的團隊 一直設法為她製造一款個性化的聲音 我們首先需要一個捐贈者, 然後我們會讓珊曼莎 發一些音"}, {"zh-tw": " What she can produce are mostly vowel-like sounds, but that's enough for us to extract her source characteristics. What happens next is best described by my daughter's analogy. She's six.", "en": " 雖然她所發出的音大部分都類似母音, 但我們用這些已足夠 來取得她聲音根源的特性 接下來所發生的事 用我女兒的比喻來描述再合適不過, 她6歲"}, {"zh-tw": " She calls it mixing colors to paint voices. It's beautiful. It's exactly that.", "en": " 她說這是混合顏色來畫聲音 很漂亮, 就是這樣"}, {"zh-tw": " Samantha's voice is like a concentrated sample of red food dye which we can infuse into the recordings of her surrogate to get a pink voice just like this.
