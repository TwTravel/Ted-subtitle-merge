(Robot noises) But that wasn't the kind of robotmy dad had in mind.", "en": " 我等不及能夠快點開始做這件事情 這樣我就可以讓凱文「見識見識」我的機器人 (機器人的聲音) 這並不是當時我父親所想的那種機器人"}, {"zh-tw": " See, he owned a chromium-plating company, and they had to move heavy steel partsbetween tanks of chemicals. And so he neededan industrial robot like this, that could basically do the heavy lifting.", "en": " 當時他擁有一家鍍鉻公司 他們得在一堆化學物品中 搬運沉重的鋼鐵零件 所以他需要一個像這樣的工業機器人 來搬運重物"}, {"zh-tw": " But my dad didn't getthe kind of robot he wanted, either. He and I worked on it for several years, but it was the 1970s, and the technologythat was available to amateurs just wasn't there yet.", "en": " 但是我父親並沒有得到他想要的那種機器人 我父親和我在這件事情上努力了好幾年 但是當時是1970年代 還沒有出現 非專業人士能夠取得的技術"}, {"zh-tw": " So Dad continued to dothis kind of work by hand. And a few years later, he was diagnosed with cancer.", "en": " 因此我父親靠著人工繼續這類工作 幾年後"}, {"zh-tw": " You see, what the robot we were tryingto build was telling him was not about doing the heavy lifting. It was a warning about his exposure to the toxic chemicals.", "en": " 他被診斷患有癌症 你看，當時我們想做的那種機器人 不是在告訴他不要搬重物 而是對他暴露在有毒的化學物品中的一種警告"}, {"zh-tw": " He didn't recognize that at the time, and he contracted leukemia.

So what I'd like to tell you aboutare four robot projects, and how they've inspired meto be a better human.", "en": " 在那之後，我一直在研究機器人 我想向你們介紹的是 四項機器人設計"}, {"zh-tw": " By 1993, I was a young professor at USC, and I was just building upmy own robotics lab, and this was the yearthe World Wide Web came out. And I remember my studentswere the ones who told me about it, and we would -- we were just amazed.", "en": " 以及這些設計如何啟發我成為更好的人 1993年以前我是南加大(USC)裡的一個年輕教授 當時才要開始建立我個人的機器人實驗室 網路的出現也是在這一年 我記得是我的學生 告訴我網路的出現 我們對此讚嘆不已"}, {"zh-tw": " We started playing with this,and that afternoon, we realized that we could usethis new, universal interface to allow anyone in the worldto operate the robot in our lab. So, rather than have it fightor do industrial work, we decided to build a planter, put the robot into the center of it, and we called it the Telegarden.", "en": " 我們開始摸索網路 某個下午我們發現可以利用這個縱橫全球的平台 讓全世界任何一個人 來操作我們實驗室中的機器人 我們捨棄將它做為戰鬥或工業使用 選擇用它來耕種 我們把機器人放在這東西的中心位置 並稱它為天線花園"}, {"zh-tw": " And we had put a camerain the gripper of the hand of the robot, and we wrote somespecial scripts and software, so that anyone in the world could come in, and by clicking on the screen, they could move the robot aroundand visit the garden. But we also set up some other software that lets you participateand help us water the garden, remotely.", "en": " 我們在機器人手上的夾具裝設了照相機 也寫了專屬的程式和軟體 如此一來 世界各地的人就可以透過點擊螢幕 進來任意移動機器人 並且參觀花園 我們同時也設有其他軟體 讓人們進來幫忙我們遙控澆水"}, {"zh-tw": " And if you watered it a few times, we'd give you your own seed to plant. Now, this was an engineering project, and we published some paperson the system design of it, but we also thought of itas an art installation.", "en": " 在你澆過幾次水之後 我們就會給你種子去栽種 這是一個設計，一個工程設計 我們出版了一些 天線花園系統設計的文件 但我們也視天線花園為一種裝置藝術"}, {"zh-tw": " It was invited, after the first year, by the Ars Electronica Museum in Austria, to have it installed in their lobby.

Now, one day, I got a call out of the bluefrom a student, who asked a very simplebut profound question.", "en": " 操作這個機器人的人數 比歷史上任何其他機器人都還要多 有一天 我突然接到 一個學生的電話 他問了我一個非常簡單卻意義深遠的問題"}, {"zh-tw": " He said, \"Is the robot real?\" Now, everyone else had assumed it was, and we knew it was,because we were working with it.

This was right about the timethat I was offered a position here at Berkeley.", "en": " 我想了很久 卻想不出能讓他分辨兩者差異的方法 這件事情差不多是發生在 柏克萊大學(Berkeley)請我過來工作的時候"}, {"zh-tw": " And when I got here, I looked up Hubert Dreyfus, who's a world-renownedprofessor of philosophy, And I talked with himabout this and he said, \"This is one of the oldestand most central problems in philosophy. It goes back to the Skepticsand up through Descartes.", "en": " 我到達這裡時 拜訪了世界著名的哲學家德雷佛斯 我和他談到這件事情，他說 這是最古老也最重要的哲學問題之一 這要回顧到懷疑主義者 並且向上追溯至笛卡兒"}, {"zh-tw": " It's the issue of epistemology, the study of how do we knowthat something is true.\" So he and I started working together, and we coined a new term:\"telepistemology,\" the study of knowledge at a distance. We invited leading artists,engineers and philosophers to write essays about this, and the results are collectedin this book from MIT Press.", "en": " 這是認識知識論的問題 研究如何判別事物真假 我們開始一起研究 創造出一個新名詞：天線認識論 是對遠距知識的研究 我們邀請了藝術家、工程師以及哲學家的先驅 來寫一篇相關報告 研究結果發表在麻省理工學院 出版的這本書裡"}, {"zh-tw": " So thanks to this student, who questioned what everyone elsehad assumed to be true, this project taught mean important lesson about life, which is to always question assumptions. Now, the second projectI'll tell you about grew out of the Telegarden.", "en": " 我要感謝這名提出疑問的學生 他質疑了所有人都相信的事實 這件事情給我上了人生的一課 就是我們要對任何假設提出質疑 我要講的第二項設計 是在天線花園之後發展出來的"}, {"zh-tw": " As it was operating, my studentsand I were very interested in how people were interactingwith each other, and what they were doing with the garden. So we started thinking: what if the robot could leave the garden and go out into some otherinteresting environment? Like, for example,what if it could go to a dinner party at the White House? So, because we were interestedmore in the system design and the user interfacethan in the hardware, we decided that, rather than have a robot replacethe human to go to the party, we'd have a human replace the robot.", "en": " 天線花園還在運作的時候 我的學生和我對於人與人的互動 以及他們在花園中所做的事情很感興趣 我們開始思考 如果機器人可以離開花園 進入其他有意思的環境中會怎麼樣呢? 比方說 在白宮舉行的晚宴? 比起硬體設備 我們對系統設計和使用者平台更感興趣 因此我們決定 讓人來取代機器人 而不是機器人取代人去參加宴會"}, {"zh-tw": " We called it the Tele-Actor. We got a human, someone who's veryoutgoing and gregarious, and she was outfitted with a helmetwith various equipment, cameras and microphones, and then a backpack with wirelessInternet connection.", "en": " 我們稱之為人形機器人 我們找到一個人 她非常外向又熱衷社交 她戴著一頂頭盔 上面有各種設備、攝影機和麥克風 背著一個備有無線網路連線功能的背包"}, {"zh-tw": " And the idea was that she could go into a remote and interesting environment, and then over the Internet, people could experiencewhat she was experiencing. So they could see what she was seeing, but then, more importantly,they could participate, by interacting with each otherand coming up with ideas about what she should do nextand where she should go, and then conveying thoseto the Tele-Actor.", "en": " 我們的想法是 她可以進入一個有意思的遠距環境 人們可以透過網路體驗她所經歷的 看到她所看的 更重要的是 人們可以透過與其他人的互動參與其中 關於她該做什麼去哪裡 我們想了很多點子 並且將這些都傳輸到人形機器人上"}, {"zh-tw": " So we got a chance to take the Tele-Actor to the Webby Awards in San Francisco. And that year, Sam Donaldson was the host.", "en": " 我們得到機會，把人形機器人 帶到在舊金山舉行的威比獎典禮上 那年的主持人是山姆．唐納森"}, {"zh-tw": " Just before the curtain wentup, I had about 30 seconds to explain to Mr. Donaldsonwhat we were going to do. And I said, \"The Tele-Actoris going to be joining you onstage.", "en": " 在幕簾拉開之前 我有大概30秒時間向唐納森先生說明我們要做的事 我說 人形機器人會和你一起出現在舞台上"}, {"zh-tw": " This is a new experimental project, and people are watching heron their screens, there's cameras involvedand there's microphones and she's got an earbud in her ear, and people over the networkare giving her advice about what to do next.\" And he said, \"Wait a second. That's what I do.\" So he loved the concept, and when the Tele-Actor walked onstage,she walked right up to him, and she gave him a big kissright on the lips.", "en": " 這是一項實驗性的新設計 人們會從自己的螢幕上看到她 她身上有攝影機和麥克風 單邊耳朵會戴耳機 她下一步該怎麼做 人們會透過網路給她出主意 唐納森先生說 慢著，那是我的工作 他很喜歡這個概念 在人形機器人步上舞台時 她直接朝唐納森先生走去 並且在他嘴唇上用力親了一下"}, {"zh-tw": " We were totally surprised --we had no idea that would happen. And he was great, he just gave hera big hug in return, and it worked out great.", "en": " 我們都非常驚訝 這是我們意料之外的事情 唐納森先生人非常好，回給她一個大擁抱 得到熱烈的回響"}, {"zh-tw": " But that night, as we were packing up, I asked the Tele-Actor,how did the Tele-Directors decide that they would givea kiss to Sam Donaldson? And she said they hadn't. She said, when she wasjust about to walk onstage, the Tele-Directors still were tryingto agree on what to do, and so she just walked onstageand did what felt most natural.", "en": " 當天晚上，在我們打包的時候 我問了人形機器人 導演是如何決定讓她親山姆‧唐納森的 她說他們並沒有要她這麼做 她說在她上台之前 導演們還在討論要怎麼做 所以她就走上台 做了她覺得應該做的"}, {"zh-tw": " So, the successof the Tele-Actor that night was due to the factthat she was a wonderful actor. She knew when to trust her instincts.", "en": " 因此，那晚人形機器人的成功 完全歸功於她是個很棒的演員 她知道什麼時候該相信自己的直覺"}, {"zh-tw": " And so that project taught meanother lesson about life, which is that, when in doubt, improvise. Now, the third projectgrew out of my experience when my father was in the hospital.", "en": " 這個設計給我上了人生中另一課 不確定怎麼做的時候，要隨機應變 第三項設計是源自我父親住院時 我個人的經驗"}, {"zh-tw": " He was undergoing a treatment --chemotherapy treatments -- and there's a related treatmentcalled brachytherapy, where tiny, radioactive seedsare placed into the body to treat cancerous tumors. And the way it's done,as you can see here, is that surgeonsinsert needles into the body to deliver the seeds.", "en": " 當時我父親在接受化療 還有另一種相關療法 稱為近距放射療法 是將微小的放射性種子植入體內來治療癌症腫瘤 這個療法正如你所見 外科醫師會把針插在人體上 來傳遞放射性種子"}, {"zh-tw": " And all these needlesare inserted in parallel. So it's very common that someof the needles penetrate sensitive organs.", "en": " 這些插入人體的針呈平行排列 因此有些針 很容易會刺入敏感的器官"}, {"zh-tw": " And as a result, the needles damagethese organs, cause damage, which leads to trauma and side effects. So my students and I wondered: what if we could modify the system, so that the needlescould come in at different angles? So we simulated this; we developed some optimizationalgorithms and we simulated this.", "en": " 結果這些針破壞了器官 引起器官損傷及副作用 我的學生和我開始想 我們是不是可以改善這個系統 讓針可以從不同角度插入 我們做了模擬 找出最佳的運算法則並再次模擬"}, {"zh-tw": " And we were able to show that we are able to avoidthe delicate organs, and yet still achieve the coverageof the tumors with the radiation. So now, we're working with doctors at UCSF and engineers at Johns Hopkins, and we're building a robotthat has a number of -- it's a specialized designwith different joints that can allow the needles to come inat an infinite variety of angles.", "en": " 我們有辦法做到避開脆弱的器官 同時仍然能夠維持 放射線在腫瘤上的覆蓋範圍 我們現在和加州大學舊金山分校裡的醫生 以及約翰霍普金斯大學裡的工程師合作 我們正在做一種機器人 它經過特殊設計，有許多的關節 讓針能夠以各種不同角度插入"}, {"zh-tw": " And as you can see here,they can avoid delicate organs and still reach the targetsthey're aiming for. So, by questioning this assumptionthat all the needles have to be parallel, this project also taught mean important lesson: When in doubt, when your pathis blocked, pivot.", "en": " 如你所見，他們可以避開脆弱的器官 在需要的地方插針 透過對針必須以平行排列有所懷疑 我又在這個設計上學到一件事情 就是當我們心中有疑問時 當你眼前的路受到阻斷時，就換條路走吧(投影片翻譯)1. 要質疑假設2. 猶疑不定時，要隨機應變3. 此路不通時，要繞道而行"}, {"zh-tw": " And the last projectalso has to do with medical robotics. And this is somethingthat's grown out of a system called the da Vinci surgical robot.", "en": " 最後一個設計也是跟醫學機器人有關 這是從一個叫做 達文西手術機器人的系統中發展出來的"}, {"zh-tw": " And this is a commerciallyavailable device. It's being used in over 2,000hospitals around the world.", "en": " 這個設備市面上可以買得到 全球已經有超過兩千家醫院使用這項設備"}, {"zh-tw": " The idea is it allows the surgeonto operate comfortably in his own coordinate frame. Many of the subtasks in surgery are veryroutine and tedious, like suturing, and currently, all of these are performed under the specific and immediatecontrol of the surgeon.", "en": " 這個創意讓外科醫生 能夠在屬於自己的空間裡自在地做手術 但是許多手術的附加工作 比方說縫合，是非常一成不變又沉悶的 目前這些工作的執行 都是直接由外科醫生專門管控"}, {"zh-tw": " So the surgeon becomes fatigued over time. And we've been wondering, what if we could program the robotto perform some of these subtasks, and thereby free the surgeon to focus on the more complicatedparts of the surgery, and also cut down on the timethat the surgery would take if we could get the robotto do them a little bit faster? Now, it's hard to program a robotto do delicate things like this.", "en": " 造成外科醫生的過度疲勞 我們一直在思考 如果我們能設計讓機器人 來執行部分的附加工作 就可以讓外科醫生 專心投入在手術中更複雜的部分 如果我們能夠讓機器人的動作加快一些 也能夠縮短手術時間 要設計讓機器人做這種精細的工作是很困難的"}, {"zh-tw": " But it turns out my colleaguePieter Abbeel, who's here at Berkeley, has developed a new set of techniquesfor teaching robots from example. So he's gotten robots to fly helicopters, do incredibly interesting,beautiful acrobatics, by watching human experts fly them.", "en": " 但是我柏克萊大學的同事 皮耶特‧阿布比爾做到了 他研發出一套讓機器人從實例中學習的新技術 透過觀摩專家的飛行 他成功讓機器人駕駛直升機 做一些有意思又讓人驚艷的特技"}, {"zh-tw": " So we got one of these robots. We started working with Pieterand his students.", "en": " 我們取得一個這種機器人 開始和皮耶特還有他的學生一起研究"}, {"zh-tw": " And we asked a surgeonto perform a task -- with the robot. So what we're doing is askingthe surgeon to perform the task, and we record the motions of the robot.", "en": " 我們請一個外科醫生執行手術 我們的做法是和機器人一起 我們要求機器人 也進行手術 然後我們把機器人的一舉一動都錄下來"}, {"zh-tw": " So here's an example. I'll use tracing outa figure eight as an example.", "en": " 接下來我用八字縫合 做為例子說明"}, {"zh-tw": " So here's what it looks likewhen the robot -- this is what the robot's pathlooks like, those three examples. Now, those are much betterthan what a novice like me could do, but they're still jerky and imprecise.", "en": " 這裡有三個例子 是由機器人所做的 八字縫合 這遠比我這個外行人所能做的要強得多 但是還是不夠純熟精準"}, {"zh-tw": " So we record all these examples, the data, and then go through a sequence of steps. First, we use a techniquecalled dynamic time warping from speech recognition.", "en": " 所以我們記錄所有的例子和數據 然後仔細看過一連串的步驟 首先，我們使用了一個取自語言識別 名為動態時間校正的技術"}, {"zh-tw": " And this allows us to temporallyalign all of the examples. And then we apply Kalman filtering,a technique from control theory, that allows us to statisticallyanalyze all the noise and extract the desiredtrajectory that underlies them.", "en": " 這讓我們能夠暫時結合所有的實例 接著我們採用卡爾曼濾波器 這是一門採自控制理論的技術 這個技術讓我們可以對所有雜訊做數據分析 節取我們想要的軌跡"}, {"zh-tw": " Now we take those human demonstrations -- they're all noisy and imperfect -- and we extract from theman inferred task trajectory and control sequence for the robot. We then execute that on the robot, we observe what happens, then we adjust the controls, using a sequence of techniquescalled iterative learning.", "en": " 我們的做法是 從這些嘈雜又不盡完美的人體示範中 取出套用在機器人身上的 任務判別軌跡以及控制程式 接著我們在機器人上面執行 觀察整個過程 然後利用稱為反覆學習的一系列技術 來調整控制器"}, {"zh-tw": " Then what we do is we increasethe velocity a little bit. We observe the results,adjust the controls again, and observe what happens.", "en": " 接著我們做的是，稍微調快速率 我們觀察結果，又調整了控制器 再接著觀察"}, {"zh-tw": " And we go through this several rounds. And here's the result.", "en": " 我們重覆這個過程好幾次 得到這個結果"}, {"zh-tw": " That's the inferred task trajectory, and here's the robotmoving at the speed of the human. Here's four times the speed of the human.", "en": " 這個是推論的工作軌跡 這個則是機器人與人類以同樣速度移動的軌跡 這是比人類快四倍的軌跡"}, {"zh-tw": " Here's seven times. And here's the robot operatingat 10 times the speed of the human.", "en": " 這是快七倍的 這是機器人以比人類快十倍的速度 操作的軌跡"}, {"zh-tw": " So we're able to get a robotto perform a delicate task like a surgical subtask, at 10 times the speed of a human. So this project also, because of its involvedpracticing and learning, doing something over and over again, this project also has a lesson, which is: if you want to do something well, there's no substitutefor practice, practice, practice.", "en": " 所以說，我們是有辦法讓機器人 用比人類快十倍的速度 來執行像手術附加工作這樣的精細工作的 因為這個設計包含了練習和學習 多次重覆做同一件事情 所以這個設計也教了我們一件事情 就是如果你想做好一件事情 就只能不斷地練習再練習"}, {"zh-tw": " So these are four of the lessonsthat I've learned from robots over the years. And the field of roboticshas gotten much better over time.", "en": " 這些就是這幾年來 我從機器人身上學到的四門課 至於機器人學"}, {"zh-tw": " Nowadays, high school studentscan build robots, like the industrial robotmy dad and I tried to build. But, it's very -- now ...", "en": " 這個領域也隨著時間進步了許多 如今就連高中學生 也能做出像我和我父親嘗試做的那種工業機器人"}, {"zh-tw": " And now, I have a daughter, named Odessa. She's eight years old.", "en": " 現在我有個女兒 名字叫歐妲莎(Odessa) 她現在八歲"}, {"zh-tw": " And she likes robots, too. Maybe it runs in the family.", "en": " 她也喜歡機器人 這大概是家族風氣"}, {"zh-tw": " I wish she could meet my dad. And now I get to teach herhow things work, and we get to build projects together.", "en": " 我希望她有機會見到我父親 現在換我教她做事情的方法 我們一起做很多東西"}, {"zh-tw": " And I wonder what kind of lessonsshe'll learn from them. Robots are the most human of our machines.", "en": " 我常常想她能夠從中學到什麼 機器人是所有機器中 最具有人性的"}, {"zh-tw": " They can't solve allof the world's problems, but I think they have somethingimportant to teach us. I invite all of you to think about the innovationsthat you're interested in, the machines that you wish for.", "en": " 它們無法解決世界上的所有問題 但我認為我們可以從它們身上學到一些重要的事 我希望各位去思考 那些你感興趣的發明 你夢想中的機器"}, {"zh-tw": " And think aboutwhat they might be telling you. Because I have a hunch that manyof our technological innovations, the devices we dream about, can inspire us to be better humans.", "en": " 想想這些東西可能要傳達的訊息 因為我的直覺告訴我 許多我們夢想中的 科技發明和設備 可以啟發我們成為更好的人"}, {"zh-tw": " Thank you.", "en": " 謝謝"}], "title": "Ken Goldberg 4 Lessons From Robots About Being Human"}
