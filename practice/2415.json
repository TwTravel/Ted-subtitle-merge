The human drama in which each one of usplays a part is a great story, a story that encompasses the whole world and that came to unfoldin the three stages of the painting in the Sistine Chapel."}, {"zh-tw": "這座建築物當初開始的時候是為一小部分人提供了空間多是富裕而有學識的神父們他們在那裡禱告他們在那裡推選他們的教皇", "en": "Now, this building started outas a space for a small group of wealthy, educated Christian priests. They prayed there.They elected their pope there."}, {"zh-tw": "五百年前那是一個擁有無上榮譽的終極神父洞窟所以你大概會問 那這個教堂是如何做到每年能吸引並將歡欣帶給來自完全不同背景的五百萬人的呢因為在那壓縮了的空間裡存在了一種創意大爆發新地緣政治的前沿變化帶動而來的強烈刺激觸發了它並點燃激發了教會的傳教傳統同時也創造了歷史上最偉大的藝術品之一", "en": "Five hundred years ago, it was the ultimateecclesiastical man cave. So, you may ask, how can it bethat today it attracts and delights five million people a year, from all different backgrounds?

Instead of being accustomedto filling space with busyness, he took a hammer and chiseland hacked away at a piece of marble to reveal the figure within."}, {"zh-tw": "米開朗基羅是一位本質主義者他透過宏偉而互動的軀體講述故事這個計劃得到了教皇尤利烏斯二世的支持他是一位傳奇人物無懼於米開朗基羅這樣自負的天才", "en": "Michelangelo was an essentialist; he would tell his storyin massive, dynamic bodies.

The next figure looms larger, and you see a figure hurtlingfrom one side to the next."}, {"zh-tw": "祂在醒著的時候創造了太陽 月亮 植物米開朗基羅的重點並不在於被創造的事物有別於所有其他的藝術家", "en": "He leaves in his wakethe sun, the moon, vegetation.

And then the movement stops,like a caesura in poetry and the creator hovers."}, {"zh-tw": "而創造者在徘徊那祂在幹嗎哪祂在創造大地 祂在創造大海還是祂在顧盼著自己的創作整個宇宙和他的珍寶就像米開朗基羅那樣顧盼著自己在天花壁上的作品並且宣稱 幹得好這樣下來整個場景已擬定然後你來到了創造的高潮部分創造人類亞當躍進了眼裏 在深暗的背景上跳入一個輕巧的身軀", "en": "So what's he doing? Is he creating land? Is he creating sea? Or is he looking back over his handiwork,the universe and his treasures, just like Michelangelo must have, looking back over his work in the ceiling and proclaiming, \"It is good.\" So now the scene is set, and you get to the culminationof creation, which is man. Adam leaps to the eye, a light figureagainst a dark background."}, {"zh-tw": "但看得近一點他的腿部痠軟地落在地上手臂負苛在膝蓋上亞當缺乏了那種會促使他偉大由內綻放出來的靈光", "en": "But looking closer, that leg is pretty languid on the ground, the arm is heavy on the knee. Adam lacks that interior spark that will impel him to greatness."}, {"zh-tw": "那靈光將會從創造者的那手指授賜就在亞當的手一毫米之距這吸引了我們的專注因為我們就在那接觸的頃刻之間在那一刻人類會發現自己的意義躍升到一個地位 成為了創造之顛", "en": "That spark is about to be conferredby the creator in that finger, which is one millimeterfrom the hand of Adam. It puts us at the edge of our seats, because we're one momentfrom that contact, through which that manwill discover his purpose, leap up and take his placeat the pinnacle of creation."}, {"zh-tw": "米開朗基羅再拋出了一個弧線球誰在另一邊的手臂夏娃 第一位女性", "en": "And then Michelangelo threw a curveball. Who is in that other arm? Eve, first woman."}, {"zh-tw": "不 她不是事後想出來的她是創造計畫的一部份她從來都已經在祂心中。", "en": "No, she's not an afterthought.She's part of the plan.

And for me, an American art historianfrom the 21st century, this was the momentthat the painting spoke to me."}, {"zh-tw": "因為我體會到在這個具代表性的人生戲劇總是述說著男性和女性最最重要的 夏娃在教堂的中央在天花壁上的核心位置主角其實是女性 而不是亞當事實上 當你看到他倆在伊甸園他倆雙雙墮落他倆原來驕傲的姿勢雙雙轉化為一種收納起的羞愧", "en": "Because I realized that thisrepresentation of the human drama was always about men and women -- so much so, that the dead center,the heart of the ceiling, is the creation of woman, not Adam.

Oh, but no, Noah is the onewho grew grapes, invented wine, got drunk and passed outnaked in his barn."}, {"zh-tw": "那是一個奇異的方式去設計天花從上帝創造萬物開始而以一個宿醉在榖場的男人作結所以 如果與亞當比起來你大概會覺得米開朗基羅在開我們玩笑", "en": "It is a curious way to design the ceiling, now starting out with God creating life, ending up with some guyblind drunk in a barn. And so, compared with Adam, you might think Michelangelois making fun of us."}, {"zh-tw": "但是他馬上就驅祛這愁緒在挪亞的下方 借用了絢爛的顏色翠綠 黃玉 斐紅描繪出先知撒迦利亞撒迦利亞預見了從東邊來的一道光就在這個交滙點我們就被導往新的目的地女神喻者和先知們帶領我們前往參與遊行隊伍", "en": "But he's about to dispel the gloom by using those bright colorsright underneath Noah: emerald, topaz, scarleton the prophet Zechariah.

Michelangelo chose to paint destiny, that universal desire, common to all of us, to leave a legacy of excellence.
