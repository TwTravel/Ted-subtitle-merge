Let me connect the dots.", "en": " 我今天要講的題目 聼起來有些瘋狂： 社會媒體和性別區分的終結。 讓我把之間的關係解釋一下"}, {"zh-tw": " I'm going to argue today that the social media applications that we all know and love, or love to hate, are actually going to help free us from some of the absurd assumptions that we have as a society about gender. I think that social media is actually going to help us dismantle some of the silly and demeaning stereotypes that we see in media and advertising about gender.", "en": " 我今天要來闡述 讓我們又愛又恨的 社交應用程式 實際上能讓我們 從固有、荒謬的 性別差異的假設中解放。 我甚至認爲 社會媒體能幫我們 破除一些在現有媒體和廣告裏 充斥、圍繞在性別上的 既有概念。"}, {"zh-tw": " If you hadn't noticed, our media climate generally provides a very distorted mirror of our lives and of our gender, and I think that's going to change. Now most media companies -- television, radio, publishing, games, you name it -- they use very rigid segmentation methods in order to understand their audiences.", "en": " 如果你還沒注意到， 在當今的媒體氛圍裏所呈現的 我們的生活和性別 跟實際是有很大的差異的。 我認爲這將會改變。 大部分的媒體公司 像電視、廣播、出版社、遊戲等 在了解他們的觀衆聽衆上 使用的還是很僵化的區分方法。"}, {"zh-tw": " It's old-school demographics. They come up with these very restrictive labels to define us.", "en": " 是舊有的人口學 他們用這些很僵化的標籤來定義我們"}, {"zh-tw": " Now the crazy thing is that media companies believe that if you fall within a certain demographic category then you are predictable in certain ways -- you have certain taste, that you like certain things. And so the bizarre result of this is that most of our popular culture is actually based on these presumptions about our demographics.", "en": " 更瘋狂的是 媒體公司相信 你要是屬於某個群體 那麽你的行爲也是可以預測的。 你會有某些特定品味 會喜歡某些事物。 這樣的推論就導致了這個奇怪的結果： 大部分當今的流行文化 都是建立在這樣的 人口分類學上的假設上。"}, {"zh-tw": " Age demographics: the 18 to 49 demo has had a huge impact on all mass media programming in this country since the 1960s, when the baby boomers were still young. Now they've aged out of that demographic, but it's still the case that powerful ratings companies like Nielson don't even take into account viewers of television shows over age 54.", "en": " 年紀分類學： 18到49歲的年齡層 對我國大衆媒體的規劃 有重大影響。 從1960年開始 當嬰兒潮世代還年輕的時候就如此了。 現在嬰兒潮的世代已經超過這個年齡層 但是大家的做法還是沒變 像尼爾森等較大的市調公司 甚至不把年紀大於54嵗的人 列入電視市調的對象。"}, {"zh-tw": " In our media environment, it's as if they don't even exist. Now, if you watch \"Mad Men,\" like I do -- it's a popular TV show in the States -- Dr. Faye Miller does something called psychographics, which first came about in the 1960s, where you create these complex psychological profiles of consumers.", "en": " 在當今的媒體大環境裏 這些人被當作是不存在的。 你如果跟我一樣在看“廣告狂人” 這個在美國很受歡迎的連續劇 米勒博士在做一些“心理圖”的東西 這產生於1960年左右 你去對消費者勾勒出 描述複雜的心理檔案。"}, {"zh-tw": " But psychographics really haven't had a huge impact on the media business. It's really just been basic demographics.", "en": " 但是心理圖並沒有對媒體業產生重大的影響 只是停留在基礎的人口分類學上而已。"}, {"zh-tw": " So I'm at the Norman Lear Center at USC, and we've done a lot of research over the last seven, eight years on demographics and how they affect media and entertainment in this country and abroad. And in the last three years, we've been looking specifically at social media to see what has changed, and we've discovered some very interesting things.", "en": " 我在南加大的Norman Lear中心 在過去的七八年裏我們做了很多 有關人口分類學的研究 還有其對這國家或外國娛樂媒體 所產生的影響。 在最近的3年裏 我們特別研究了社會媒體的改變 我們發現了一些有趣的現象。"}, {"zh-tw": " All the people who participate in social media networks belong to the same old demographic categories that media companies and advertisers have used in order to understand them. But those categories mean even less now than they did before, because with online networking tools, it's much easier for us to escape some of our demographic boxes.", "en": " 所有使用社交媒體網路的人， 過去媒體和廣告公司爲了分析研究 所用的分類系統 也還可以套用在他們的身上。 但是這些分類的意義跟以前比起來 顯得更不重要。 因爲這些線上的社交工具 讓我們更輕易地 能跳脫人口分類的框架。"}, {"zh-tw": " We're able to connect with people quite freely and to redefine ourselves online. And we can lie about our age online, too, pretty easily.", "en": " 我們能自由地跟其他人聯係 還能重新定義我們在網上的身份。 我們也能輕易的謊報年齡。"}, {"zh-tw": " We can also connect with people based on our very specific interests. We don't need a media company to help do this for us.", "en": " 我們能和志同道合的人們 互相聯繫。 我們再也不需要媒體公司 來幫我們。"}, {"zh-tw": " So the traditional media companies, of course, are paying very close attention to these online communities. They know this is the mass audience of the future; they need to figure it out.", "en": " 所以這些傳統的媒體公司理所當然地 緊密地在注意著這些網上的群體。 他們知道這將是未來的目標群衆 他們必須了解這些人。"}, {"zh-tw": " But they're having a hard time doing it because they're still trying to use demographics in order to understand them, because that's how ad rates are still determined. When they're monitoring your clickstream -- and you know they are -- they have a really hard time figuring out your age, your gender and your income.", "en": " 但是這些人不像以前那麽容易了解 原因在於媒體公司還是用以前的分類來分析 因爲這是決定廣告費用的標準。 當他們監視你的點擊率 你也知道你是被監視的 他們很難去分析出 你的年齡、性別和收入。"}, {"zh-tw": " They can make some educated guesses. But they get a lot more information about what you do online, what you like, what interests you.", "en": " 他們據以往經驗也許能猜出些端倪 但是他們得到的資訊 大部分是關於你爲何上網 你喜歡什麽、對什麽有興趣"}, {"zh-tw": " That's easier for them to find out than who you are. And even though that's still sort of creepy, there is an upside to having your taste monitored.", "en": " 這比你是誰還容易猜到 雖然這聽起來讓人覺得怪怪的 但是有人監視你的興趣 還是有些好處的。"}, {"zh-tw": " Suddenly our taste is being respected in a way that it hasn't been before. It had been presumed before.", "en": " 突然間我們的喜好品味 得到了前所未有的重視。 在這之前都是別人幫我們設定好了。"}, {"zh-tw": " So when you look online at the way people aggregate, they don't aggregate around age, gender and income. They aggregate around the things they love, the things that they like, and if you think about it, shared interests and values are a far more powerful aggregator of human beings than demographic categories.", "en": " 你現在要是看看網路上人們聚集的原因 這不是因爲大家 有相同的年齡、性別或收入。 大家聚在一起是因爲 有相同的嗜好。 你如果再想想， 相同的嗜好，這個聚集人們的因素 比起年齡來是要強許多的。"}, {"zh-tw": " I'd much rather know whether you like \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" rather than how old you are. That would tell me something more substantial about you.", "en": " 我會比較想去知道 你喜不喜歡\"捉鬼者巴菲(Buffy the Vampire Slayer)” 而不是你今年幾嵗。 這比年紀還帶來更多的資訊。"}, {"zh-tw": " Now there's something else that we've discovered about social media that's actually quite surprising. It turns out that women are really driving the social media revolution.", "en": " 我們還發現社會媒體 一個驚人之處 那就是女人 正在帶領著社會媒體革命。"}, {"zh-tw": " If you look at the statistics -- these are worldwide statistics -- in every single age category, women actually outnumber men in their use of social networking technologies. And then if you look at the amount of time that they spend on these sites, they truly dominate the social media space, which is a space that's having a huge impact on old media.", "en": " 你如果看看統計數字 這些是世界的統計數字 在每一個年齡層裏 使用社交網路科技的女人 都比男人要來得多。 你要是再看看 她們花在這些網站的時間 女人真的主導了社會媒體的使用 而社會媒體進一步又對傳統媒體 有重大的影響。"}, {"zh-tw": " The question is: what sort of impact is this going to have on our culture, and what's it going to mean for women? If the case is that social media is dominating old media and women are dominating social media, then does that mean that women are going to take over global media? Are we suddenly going to see a lot more female characters in cartoons and in games and on TV shows? Will the next big-budget blockbuster movies actually be chick flicks? Could this be possible, that suddenly our media landscape will become a feminist landscape? Well, I actually don't think that's going to be the case. I think that media companies are going to hire a lot more women, because they realize this is important for their business, and I think that women are also going to continue to dominate the social media sphere.", "en": " 所以問題是，這對我們的文化 會帶來什麽樣的衝擊 這對女人又代表了什麽意義？ 如果說社會媒體 會主導傳統媒體 而女人又會主導社會媒體的話， 這是不是意味著說 女人會接管全球的媒體呢？ 我們是不是將會 在卡通、遊戲、或電視節目裏 看到更多的女性角色的出現呢？ 下一部好萊塢的超級大製作 會不會是女性電影呢？ 未來我們的媒體 是不是有可能 變得更有女性主義呢？ 我並不這樣認爲。 我認爲媒體公司將會雇用更多的女性員工 因爲他們了解這對公司是重要的。 我也認爲 女性會繼續主導 社會媒體。"}, {"zh-tw": " But I think women are actually going to be -- ironically enough -- responsible for driving a stake through the heart of cheesy genre categories like the \"chick flick\" and all these other genre categories that presume that certain demographic groups like certain things -- that Hispanics like certain things, that young people like certain things. This is far too simplistic.", "en": " 很諷刺地，我也認爲 女性會帶起一陣軟性 輕薄俗的片種 像是女性影片 或其他這一類的影片 那種由人口分類學假設的 某個年齡層會喜歡某種類型的影片 像拉丁裔的人喜歡某些事物 年輕人喜歡某些事物。 這樣的推論還是太簡單化了。"}, {"zh-tw": " The future entertainment media that we're going to see is going to be very data-driven, and it's going to be based on the information that we ascertain from taste communities online, where women are really driving the action. So you may be asking, well why is it important that I know what entertains people? Why should I know this? Of course, old media companies and advertisers need to know this.", "en": " 將來的媒體會是 十分資料導向的 將會是基於 我們調查線上社群的喜好品味來設計的 而這裡會由女性來主導。 你可能會問，爲什麽知道 什麽帶給人們歡樂是重要的？ 爲什麽我需要知道這些？ 當然，傳統的媒體和廣告公司 需要知道這些。"}, {"zh-tw": " But my argument is that, if you want to understand the global village, it's probably a good idea that you figure out what they're passionate about, what amuses them, what they choose to do in their free time. This is a very important thing to know about people.", "en": " 但是我的理論是 你如果想了解地球村 你最好要去知道 他們喜歡什麽，對什麽感興趣 有空時作什麽消遣。 這對了解人們來説是很重要的。"}, {"zh-tw": " I've spent most of my professional life researching media and entertainment and its impact on people's lives. And I do it not just because it's fun -- though actually, it is really fun -- but also because our research has shown over and over again that entertainment and play have a huge impact on people's lives -- for instance, on their political beliefs and on their health.", "en": " 我大部分的職業生涯 都花在了解媒體和娛樂 還有他們對人們生活的影響。 我之所以這麽做不止是因爲這很有趣 事實上，這真的很有趣， 也還因爲 我們的研究一再顯示 娛樂和遊戲 對人們的生活有深遠的影響 譬如說，對他們的政治理念 和他們的健康都有影響。"}, {"zh-tw": " And so, if you have any interest in understanding the world, looking at how people amuse themselves is a really good way to start. So imagine a media atmosphere that isn't dominated by lame stereotypes about gender and other demographic characteristics.", "en": " 再者，你如果對了解這世界有興趣 可以看看人們如何娛樂自己 這是個很好的研究起點。 所以，想像一個媒體 不是被殘缺的 性別、或其他年齡層的 刻板印象所主導。"}, {"zh-tw": " Can you even imagine what that looks like? I can't wait to find out what it looks like. Thank you so much.", "en": " 你能想像那會是怎麽樣的一個情景嗎？ 我真是等不及去看那會是怎麽樣。 謝謝大家。"}], "title": "Johanna Blakley Social Media And The End Of Gender"}
