Ever since I was a kid, I've had massive collections of random stuff, everything from bizarre hot sauces from all around the world to insects that I've captured and put in jars. Now, it's no secret, because I like collecting things, that I love the Natural History Museum and the collections of animals at the Natural History Museum in dioramas.", "en": " 我喜歡收集東西 我小的時候，收集很多不同的東西 從世界各地的奇異的辣醬到昆蟲 從世界各地的奇異的辣醬到昆蟲 被我我抓放在罐子裡 現在，這已不是秘密，我喜歡收集東西 我喜歡自然歷史博物館 還有在博物館裡 不同動物的擬真模型櫥窗"}, {"zh-tw": " These, to me, are like living sculptures, right, that you can go and look at, and they memorialize a specific point of time in this animal's life. So I was thinking about my own life, and how I'd like to memorialize my life, you know, for the ages, and also —  — the lives of my friends, but the problem with this is that my friends aren't quite keen on the idea of me taxidermy-ing them.", "en": " 這些對我而言就像是活的雕像 你可以去那邊瞧瞧 它們會紀錄該動物生命中 某種生活的當下片刻 因此我開始想到我的生活 我要如何記錄我的生活 紀錄年輕時光，還有...... 我朋友的生活 但問題是，我的朋友並不想 被製成標本"}, {"zh-tw": " So instead, I turned to video, and video is the next best way to preserve and memorialize someone and to capture a specific moment in time. So what I did was, I filmed six of my friends and then, using video mapping and video projection, I created a video sculpture, which was these six friends projected into jars.", "en": " 所以，我轉向影片 影片是次好的方式，可以保存並記錄某人的生命並捕捉他某個片刻的生活 影片是次好的方式，可以保存並記錄某人的生命並捕捉他某個片刻的生活 所以我所做的是，我為6位朋友錄影 然後，使用視覺映象原理和影片投射 我做出影片的雕像，讓這6位朋友 被投影在罐子裡"}, {"zh-tw": " So now I have this collection of my friends I can take around with me whenever I go, and this is called Animalia Chordata, from the Latin nomenclature for human being, classification system. So this piece memorializes my friends in these jars, and they actually move around.", "en": " 所以現在我收集了這些朋友 我可以隨身攜帶 這作品名為《Animalia Chordata》 其拉丁原文的意思是 人類、分類井然的系統 所以這個作品將我朋友們放在罐子裡並紀錄他們 它們其實可以活動"}, {"zh-tw": " So, this is interesting to me, but it lacked a certain human element. It's a digital sculpture, so I wanted to add an interaction system. So what I did was, I added a proximity sensor, so that when you get close to the people in jars, they react to you in different ways.", "en": " 所以我覺得這個很有趣 但卻缺少某些人類的特質 這是數位雕像，因此我想要增加 互動系統，所以我所做的 是增加距離偵測機，所以當你接近 罐子裡的人，他們會用不同的方式與你互動"}, {"zh-tw": " You know, just like people on the street when you get too close to them. Some people reacted in terror.", "en": " 就像你太靠近 街上的陌生人那樣 有些人的反應是覺得很恐怖"}, {"zh-tw": " Others reacted in asking you for help, and some people hide from you. So this was really interesting to me, this idea of taking video off the screen and putting it in real life, and also adding interactivity to sculpture.", "en": " 有些人反應是尋求幫忙 有些人會躲起來 所以我覺得這個主意真的很有趣 它把影片從螢幕擷取出來放到真實生活 加上與雕像的互動"}, {"zh-tw": " So over the next year, I documented 40 of my other friends and trapped them in jars as well and created a piece known as Garden, which is literally a garden of humanity. But something about the first piece, the Animali Chordata piece, kept coming back to me, this idea of interaction with art, and I really liked the idea of people being able to interact, and also being challenged by interacting with art.", "en": " 因此隔年，我記錄其他40位朋友 也把他們困在罐子裡 創造一個作品，名為《花園》 其實本質是一個「人性花園」 但第一件作品《Animali Chordata》 讓我我不斷回想思考一些事情 也就是與藝術品互動這個概念 我很喜歡人們能與藝術品互動的概念 並被此互動所挑戰"}, {"zh-tw": " So I wanted to create a new piece that actually forced people to come and interact with something, and the way I did this was actually by projecting a 1950s housewife into a blender. This is a piece called Blend, and what it does is it actually makes you implicit in the work of art.", "en": " 所以我想創造一件新作品 迫使人們來與它互動 而我做的方式 是將1950年的家庭主婦投影到果汁機裡 這件作品叫《混合》 它讓你成為這藝術品的一部分"}, {"zh-tw": " You may never experience the entire thing yourself. You can walk away, you can just watch as this character stands there in the blender and looks at you, or you can actually choose to interact with it.", "en": " 你可能永遠無法徹底體驗這件藝術品 你可以離開，你可以看著這個人物 她也站在裡面看著你 或你可以選擇與她互動"}, {"zh-tw": " So if you do choose to interact with the piece, and you press the blender button, it actually sends this character into this dizzying disarray of dishevelment. By doing that, you are now part of my piece.", "en": " 假使你選擇與她互動 你按下「混合」的按紐 它會讓這個人物進入頭暈腦脹的混亂狀態 當你這麼做，你成為我作品的一部分"}, {"zh-tw": " You, like the people that are trapped in my work — (Blender noises, laughter) — have become part of my work as well. But, but this seems a bit unfair, right? I put my friends in jars, I put this character, this sort of endangered species character in a blender.", "en": " 就像是其他被困在我作品裡的朋友 （果汁機的聲音、笑聲） 你也成為我作品的一部分 但這看起來有些不公平，對吧 我把我朋友放到罐子裡 我也將這「瀕臨絕種」的人物放到果汁機"}, {"zh-tw": " But I'd never done anything about myself. I'd never really memorialized myself.", "en": " 但我都沒有對自己做任何處置 我從來沒有真正記錄自己"}, {"zh-tw": " So I decided to create a piece which is a self-portrait piece. This is sort of a self-portrait taxidermy time capsule piece called A Point Just Passed, in which I project myself on top of a time card punch clock, and it's up to you.", "en": " 所以我決定創造一件自我肖像 像是把自己做成標本的作品 稱為《剛過的時光》 我將我自己投影在打卡鐘的上面 然後你可以做決定"}, {"zh-tw": " If you want to choose to punch that punch card clock, you actually age me. So I start as a baby, and then if you punch the clock, you'll actually transform the baby into a toddler, and then from a toddler I'm transformed into a teenager.", "en": " 若你想要打卡 你會讓我變老 所以我一開始是嬰兒，如果你打卡 你會讓我從嬰兒長成幼兒 然後從幼兒成為青少年"}, {"zh-tw": " From a teenager, I'm transformed into my current self. From my current self, I'm turned into a middle-aged man, and then, from there, into an elderly man.", "en": " 從青少年成為我現在的樣子 再從我現在的樣子成中年人 然後再成為老人"}, {"zh-tw": " And if you punch the punch card clock a hundred times in one day, the piece goes black and is not to be reset until the next day. So, in doing so, you're erasing time.", "en": " 如果你1天內打卡100次 這個作品會變黑 然後直到隔天才能開始新的循環 所以當你這麼做時，你消除了時間"}, {"zh-tw": " You're actually implicit in this work and you're erasing my life. So I like this about interactive video sculpture, that you can actually interact with it, that all of you can actually touch an artwork and be part of the artwork yourselves, and hopefully, one day, I'll have each and every one of you trapped in one of my jars.", "en": " 你成為這作品的一部分 你也消滅了我的生命 所以我喜歡互動式影像雕像 你可以真的與它互動 你們都可以觸摸一件藝術品 並且成為該藝術品的一部分 我也希望，有一天，我會把你們每個人 都困在我的罐子裡"}, {"zh-tw": " Thank you.", "en": " 謝謝"}], "title": "Gabriel Barcia Colombo Capturing Memories In Video Art"}
