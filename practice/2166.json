So you can imagine that it's very coolto be a forester in Brazil, among other reasons.", "en": " “巴西”成為了世界上唯一以樹為名的國家。 你可以想像，在巴西，做一個護林員是很酷的， 這只是眾多原因中的一個。"}, {"zh-tw": " Forest products are all around us. Apart from all those products, the forest is very importantfor climate regulation.", "en": " 林產品在我們周圍隨處可見。 除了這些產品，森林對氣候調節起到非常重要作用。"}, {"zh-tw": " In Brazil, almost 70 percentof the evaporation that makes rain actually comes from the forest. Just the Amazon pumps to the atmosphere20 billion tons of water every day.", "en": " 在巴西，構成雨的70%的水蒸氣 實際上來自於森林。 僅亞馬遜雨林每天就向大氣蒸發 200 億噸水。"}, {"zh-tw": " This is more than what the Amazon River,which is the largest river in the world, puts in the sea per day,which is 17 billion tons. If we had to boil water to getthe same effect as evapotranspiration, we would need six months of the entirepower generation capacity of the world.", "en": " 這比亞馬遜河，世界上最大的河， 每天注入大海的水 170 億噸還要多， 如果我們需要通過燒水來達到同樣的蒸發量， 我們需要六個月的全球發電總量。"}, {"zh-tw": " So it's a hell of a service for all of us. We have in the worldabout four billion hectares of forests.", "en": " 所以森林對我們來說立下汗馬功勞。 全世界大概有四十億公頃森林。"}, {"zh-tw": " This is more or less China, U.S.,Canada and Brazil all together, in terms of size, to have an idea.

Then we made the connectionthat areas that have been doing illegal deforestation should not getany kind of credit or finance.", "en": " 這使得我們有更大的行動力， 來緝獲腐敗和違法行為， 直接導致 700 人入獄，甚至包括不少公職人員。 接下來，通過連帶關係我們使非法開採的地區 無法得到信貸和財政資助，"}, {"zh-tw": " So we cut this through the bank systemand then linked this to the end users. So supermarkets,the slaughterhouses, and so on that buy productsfrom illegal clear-cut areas, they also can be liablefor the deforestation.", "en": " 通過銀行系統，把它與終端用戶相連。 超市，屠宰場，等等。 只要向保護區購買林產品， 他們也會被追責。"}, {"zh-tw": " So making all these connections to helpto push the problem down. And also we work a loton land tenure issues.", "en": " 所以連帶追責對問題的改善起到了一定效果。 同時我們在土地使用權的問題上採取了很多工作。"}, {"zh-tw": " It's very important for conflicts. Fifty million hectaresof protected areas were created, which is an area the size of Spain.", "en": " 這對解決爭端意義重大。 我們創造了 5000 萬公頃的保護用地， 大約是一個西班牙的面積。"}, {"zh-tw": " And of those, eight millionwere indigenous lands. Now we start to see results.", "en": " 其中 800 萬公頃是土著土地。 我們看到一些成效。"}, {"zh-tw": " So in the last 10 years, deforestation came downin Brazil 75 percent.

This is by far the largest contributionto reduce greenhouse gas emissions, until today, as a positive action.", "en": " 更重要的是，這減少了大氣中 30 億噸二氧化碳排放量。 這是至今為止對於溫室氣體減排 起到積極效應的一個最重要的舉措。"}, {"zh-tw": " One may think that when you dothese kinds of actions to decrease, to push down deforestation, you will have an economic impact because you will not haveeconomic activity or something like that. But it's interesting to knowthat it's quite the opposite.", "en": " 有人擔憂，當我們採取這些減少和遏制採伐的措施時， 經濟會受到影響。 因為你將無法開展一些經濟活動。 但有趣的是，事實恰恰相反。"}, {"zh-tw": " In fact, in the period when we havethe deepest decline of deforestation, the economy grew, on average,double from the previous decade, when deforestation was actually going up. So it's a good lesson for us.", "en": " 事實上，在森林破壞最迅速的那段時期， 經濟增長平均達到了過去十年的一倍。 這給我們上了一課。"}, {"zh-tw": " Maybe this is completely disconnected, as we just learned by havingdeforestation come down. Now this is all good news,and it's quite an achievement, and we obviously should bevery proud about that.", "en": " 或許它們毫無關聯， 恰巧發生在採伐量下降的時期。 目前全都是好消息，大成就， 我們顯然應該為此感到驕傲。"}, {"zh-tw": " But it's not even close to sufficient. In fact, if you think aboutthe deforestation in the Amazon in 2013, that was over half a million hectares, which means that every minute, an area the size of two soccer fields is being cut in the Amazonlast year, just last year.", "en": " 但是這遠不夠。 事實上，當你想想亞馬遜2013 年的砍伐量， 超過 50 萬公頃， 這意味著每一分鐘， 就有兩片足球場大小的森林遭到破壞， 去年，就在去年。"}, {"zh-tw": " If we sum up the deforestation we havein the other biomes in Brazil, we are talking about still the largestdeforestation rate in the world. It's more or less likewe are forest heroes, but still deforestation champions.", "en": " 如果把巴西其他生態群落的砍伐量相加 我們得到的依舊是全世界最大的森林破壞率。 這大概是說，我們既是森林的守護神， 同時又是森林的劊子手。"}, {"zh-tw": " So we can't be satisfied,not even close to satisfied. So the next step, I think, is to fight to have zero lossof forest cover in Brazil and to have that as a goal for 2020.", "en": " 所以我們不敢自滿，遠不能自滿。 所以下一步，我認為， 是爭取在2020年，目標達到巴西境內森林零砍伐。"}, {"zh-tw": " That's our next step. Now I've always been interestedin the relationship between climate change and forests.", "en": " 這是我們下一步計劃。 現在我著迷於這種氣候改變與森林間的關係。"}, {"zh-tw": " First, because 15 percent of greenhousegas emissions come from deforestation, so it's a big part of the problem. But also, forests can bea big part of the solution since that's the best way we knowto sink, capture and store carbon.", "en": " 首先，因為 15％ 的溫室氣體排放來源於森林砍伐， 所以這是問題的一個重要部分。 但同時，森林也是解決方案的一個重要部分， 正因我們所知的最有效解決方案就是沉積，捕捉，儲存碳。"}, {"zh-tw": " Now, there is another relationshipof climate and forests that really stuck me in 2008and made me change my career from forests to workingwith climate change. I went to visit Canada,in British Columbia, together with the chiefs ofthe forest services of other countries that we have a kind of alliance of them,like Canada, Russia, India, China, U.S.", "en": " 現在，氣候和森林有了另一關係 在 2008 年引起我深思，並因此讓我的職業跑道 從森林轉向為氣候變化。 我去訪問了加拿大，在英屬哥倫比亞， 同其他同盟國的林業部門長官， 比如加拿大，俄羅斯，印度，中國，美國。"}, {"zh-tw": " And when we were therewe learned about this pine beetle that is literally eatingthe forests in Canada. What we see here, those brown trees,these are really dead trees.", "en": " 在那我們認識了啃噬森林的松樹甲蟲。 我們在這看到的，這些棕黃色的，都是枯死的樹。"}, {"zh-tw": " They are standing dead treesbecause of the larvae of the beetle. What happens is that this beetle is controlled bythe cold weather in the winter.", "en": " 就因為這些甲蟲幼蟲。 事實是這些甲蟲受冬季寒冷的天氣控制。"}, {"zh-tw": " For many years now, they don't havethe sufficient cold weather to actually controlthe population of this beetle. And it became a diseasethat is really killing billions of trees.", "en": " 但在多年裡，我們都沒有夠多的寒冬 來控制甲蟲的數量。 然而這衍生為一種病害，數億植株遭到滅頂之災。"}, {"zh-tw": " So I came back with this notionthat the forest is actually one of the earliest and most affectedvictims of climate change. So I was thinking, if I succeed in workingwith all my colleagues to actually help to stop deforestation, maybe we will lose the battlelater on for climate change by floods, heat, fires and so on.", "en": " 所以回來以後我產生了一個概念： 森林事實上是氣候改變的最初受害者之一。 我想，即使我能與同僚們成功地抑制森林退化， 或許今後我們也將在氣候改變的PK中， 也將成為洪水，炎熱，烈火等其他災害的手下敗將。"}, {"zh-tw": " So I decided to leave the forest service and start to work directlyon climate change, find a way to think and understandthe challenge, and go from there. Now, the challenge of climate changeis pretty straightforward.", "en": " 所以我決定離開林業局 直接致力於氣候改變的工作， 找到一種方式來思考和理解所面臨的挑戰，並從此出發。 現在，氣候改變的挑戰非常明瞭。"}, {"zh-tw": " The goal is very clear. We want to limit the increaseof the average temperature of the planet to two degrees.", "en": " 目標也很明確。 我們希望全球平均氣溫的升高 控制在 2℃ 之內。"}, {"zh-tw": " There are several reasons for that. I will not get into that now.", "en": " 這有很多原因， 我現在先不詳談。"}, {"zh-tw": " But in order to getto this limit of two degrees, which is possible for us to survive, the IPCC, the IntergovernmentalPanel on Climate Change, defines that we have a budget of emissionsof 1,000 billion tons of CO2 from now until the end of the century. So if we divide thisby the number of years, what we have is an average budgetof 11 billion tons of CO2 per year.", "en": " 但為了爭取這 2℃ 的限制 ﹣ 也就為我們贏得了生存空間， IPCC ﹣ 政府間氣候變化專門委員會， 限定說到本世紀末，二氧化碳排放量配額在 10000 億噸。 分配到每年， 我們可以平均排放 110 億的二氧化碳。"}, {"zh-tw": " Now what is one ton of CO2? It's more or less what one small car,running 20 kilometers a day, will emit in one year. Or it's one flight, one way, from São Paulo to Johannesburgor to London, one way.", "en": " 那麼一噸的二氧化碳有多少呢？ 大概是一輛小車每天跑 20 千米， 一年的排放量。 或者是一趟航班， 從聖保羅到約翰內斯堡，或者倫敦，單程的排放量。"}, {"zh-tw": " Two ways, two tons. So 11 billion tons is twice that.", "en": " 往返，兩噸。 所以說 110 億是我們當下年排放量的兩倍，"}, {"zh-tw": " Now the emissions todayare 50 billion tons, and it's growing. It's growing and maybeit will be 61 by 2020.", "en": " 我們當今的排放量 500 億噸，還在持續增長。 可能在 2020 年達到 610 億噸。"}, {"zh-tw": " Now we need to go down to 10 by 2050. And while this happens, the population will growfrom seven to nine billion people, the economy will growfrom 60 trillion dollars in 2010 to 200 trillion dollars.", "en": " 我們需要在 2050 年前把它降低到 100 億。 與此同時， 全球人口將從現在的 70 億增長到 90 億， 經濟將從 2010 年的 60 兆增長到 200 兆。"}, {"zh-tw": " And so what we need to dois to be much more efficient in a way that we can gofrom seven tons of carbon per capita per person, per year,into something like one. You have to choose.You take the airplane or you have a car.", "en": " 所以我們需要更有效率地 把人均二氧化碳排放量從 7 噸降低到每人、每年差不多 1 噸。 我們必須做出選擇。你是搭乘飛機呢，還是擁有汽車。"}, {"zh-tw": " So the question is, can we make it? And that's the exactly the same question I got when I was developinga plan to combat deforestation. It's such a big problem, so complex.Can we really do it? I think so. Think of this: Deforestation means 60 percentof the greenhouse gas emissions in Brazil in the last decade.", "en": " 問題是，我們做的到嗎？ 這也是當我制定反森林破壞計劃時碰到的一個同樣的問題。 問題如此龐大，如此複雜。我們可以做到嗎？ 我認為可以。 試想：森林退化造成了過去十年裡巴西 60％ 的溫室氣體排放。"}, {"zh-tw": " Now it's a little bitless than 30 percent. In the world, 60 percent is energy.", "en": " 這個數字現在不到 30％。 而當今，60％ 多的排放源自能源。"}, {"zh-tw": " So if we can tackle directly the energy, the same way we couldtackle deforestation, maybe we can have a chance. So there are five thingsthat I think we should do.", "en": " 如果我們直接從能源入手， 以同樣方式對付森林破壞的方式， 我們可能會有希望。 所以我們可以做的有五點："}, {"zh-tw": " First, we need to disconnect developmentfrom carbon emissions. We don't need to clear-cut all the foreststo actually get more jobs and agriculture and have more economy.", "en": " 首先，我們應該把發展和二氧化碳的聯繫斷開。 我們並不需要通過砍伐森林 來創造工作，農業或者商業利益。"}, {"zh-tw": " That's what we provedwhen we decreased deforestation and the economy continued to grow. Same thing could happenin the energy sector.", "en": " 我們在降低森林砍伐率的同時就已經證明了經濟可以持續增長。 能源方面也是如此。"}, {"zh-tw": " Second, we have to movethe incentives to the right place. Today, 500 billion dollars a yeargoes into subsidies for fossil fuels.", "en": " 第二，我們必須把激勵給正確的地方。 今天，一年有 5 千億元被用於對化石燃料的補貼。"}, {"zh-tw": " Why don't we put a price on carbonand transfer this to the renewable energy? Third, we need to measureand make it transparent where, when and whois emitting greenhouse gases so we can have actions specificallyfor each one of those opportunities. Fourth, we need to leapfrogthe routes of development, which means, you don't needto go to the landline telephone before you get to the mobile phones.", "en": " 為什麼不在碳上漲價，貼補給可再生能源？ 第三，我們需要監測並發布 誰在哪裡，什麼時間，排放了溫室氣體， 我們得以有針對性地對每一次行為作出反應。 第四，我們需要跳躍式發展前進， 這意味著，我們不必在得到手機前一定先裝個固定電話。"}, {"zh-tw": " Same way we don't needto go to fossil fuels to the one billion peoplewho don't have access to energy before we get to the clean energy. And fifth and last, we need to share responsibilitybetween governments, business and civil society.", "en": " 同樣，尚未使用能源的10億人口也不需要先經過化石燃料 才能享用清潔能源。 第五點，也是最後一點， 我們需要和不同的政府，商業，民政組織分擔責任。"}, {"zh-tw": " There is work to do for everybody,and we need to have everybody on board. So to finalize, I think the future is not like a fate that you have to just goas business as usual goes.", "en": " 每個人都肩負使命，我們需要大家攜手前行。 最後，我相信未來並非一場宿命， 一場商業世界你不得不遵循的宿命。"}, {"zh-tw": " We need to have the courageto actually change the route, invest in something new, think that we can actuallychange the route. I think we are doing thiswith deforestation in Brazil, and I hope we can do it alsowith climate change in the world.", "en": " 我們需要勇氣打破常規，擁抱新的理念， 我們需要認識到我們有能力改變常規。 解決巴西森林退化的問題，我們已經做到了。 我希望，應對全球氣候變化的挑戰，我們也能辦到。"}, {"zh-tw": " Thank you.", "en": " 謝謝大家。"}], "title": "Tasso Azevedo Hopeful Lessons From The Battle To Save Rainforests"}
