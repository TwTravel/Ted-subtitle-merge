Well, the leading epidemiologistsand criminologists around the world seem to think we can, and so do I, but only if we focus on our cities,especially the most fragile ones. You see, I've been thinkingabout this a lot."}, {"zh-tw": "過去 20 年來，我工作的國家和城市充斥著衝突、動亂或恐怖主義，甚者樣樣皆有；我曾經由俄羅斯到索馬利亞追蹤過軍火走私者、與阿富汗以及剛果的軍閥共事過、在哥倫比亞、海地、斯里蘭卡、巴布亞紐幾內亞等地計算過屍體。", "en": "For the last 20 years, I've been working in countries and citiesripped apart by conflict, violence, terrorism, or someinsidious combination of all.

There's this feeling that internationalinstability is the new normal. But I want you to take a closer look, and I think you'll see thatthe geography of violence is changing, because it's not so much our nation statesthat are gripped by conflict and crime as our cities: Aleppo, Bamako, Caracas, Erbil, Mosul, Tripoli, Salvador."}, {"zh-tw": "暴力正向大都市遷移。也許這是預料中之事，對吧？畢竟現今絕大多數人住在城市而不是鄉間，", "en": "Violence is migrating to the metropole.

After all, most people today,they live in cities, not the countryside."}, {"zh-tw": "600個城市——包括30個巨型城市，就佔了全球GDP的三分之二。不過當說到城市的時候，話題大都由北部地區主導，所謂北部地區，是指北美、西歐、澳洲和日本，這些地方暴動確實是史上的低點；", "en": "Just 600 cities, including 30 megacities,account for two thirds of global GDP.

Now, some diplomatsand development experts and specialists, they talk about 40 to 50 fragile states that will shape securityin the 21st century."}, {"zh-tw": "我認為：這些脆弱城市會直接決定未來的秩序和穩定。因為戰爭和人道救助行動即將要匯聚到我們的城市裡，為發展而起的鬥爭，無論是消滅貧窮、普及醫療保健，還是擊退氣候變化，成敗關鍵都在城市中的破屋、殘樓、貧民窟。", "en": "I think it's fragile cities which willdefine the future of order and disorder.

Now, if violence isre-concentrating geographically, it's also being reconfiguredto the world's new topography, because when it comes to cities,the world ain't flat, like Thomas Friedman likes to say."}, {"zh-tw": "世界是尖的。城市至上成為了城市生活主要方式，這是歷史上最不尋常的人口結構逆轉之一，而且這全都發生得太快，", "en": "It's spiky. The dominance of the cityas the primary mode of urban living is one of the most extraordinarydemographic reversals in history, and it all happened so fast."}, {"zh-tw": "大家都知道這些數字，對吧？今天世界上有73億人，到2050年世界將有96億人。不過請考量這個事實，在十九世紀，30個人當中有1個人是住在城市裡，在今天每兩人中會有一個是住在都市裡，未來肯定是每個人都會住在都市裡；", "en": "You all know the figures, right? There's 7.3 billion peoplein the world today; there will be 9.6 billion by 2050.

The vast majority, 90 percent, will be happening in the South,in cities of the South."}, {"zh-tw": "所以都市地理學和人口統計學的學者們告訴我們：一個城市的大小或密度不一定會造成暴力，不一定。東京有三千五百萬人口，是最大的、有些人還可能會說是最安全的都會型城市之一。", "en": "So urban geographers and demographers, they tell us that it's not necessarilythe size or even the density of cities that predicts violence, no. Tokyo, with 35 million people, is one of the largest, and some might saysafest, urban metropolises in the world."}, {"zh-tw": "都市化的速度才是關鍵，我叫它「渦輪式都市化」，這是脆弱的關鍵導因之一，", "en": "No, it's the speed ofurbanization that matters. I call this turbo-urbanization, and it's one of the key drivers of fragility."}, {"zh-tw": "當你在想這些城市不合理的擴張、想想看「渦輪都市化」，想一下喀拉蚩吧，喀拉蚩在1947年約有50萬人，是一個繁忙的城市。", "en": "When you think about the incredibleexpansion of these cities, and you think about turbo-urbanization,think about Karachi. Karachi was about 500,000 people in 1947,a hustling, bustling city."}, {"zh-tw": "今天它有兩千一百萬人口，佔有巴基斯坦GDP的三分之四，它還是南亞最暴亂的城市之一。達卡、拉哥斯、金夏沙等，這些城市比起 1950 年時要大40倍；", "en": "Today, it's 21 million people, and apart from accountingfor three quarters of Pakistan's GDP, it's also one of the most violentcities in South Asia.

The Big Apple, it took 150 yearsto get to eight million people."}, {"zh-tw": "墨西哥的聖保羅市花了15 年達到一樣的人口級距，如今這些中型、大型、巨型，以及超級城市是怎麼樣貌呢?這些城市是什麼樣子？首先，這些城市都很年輕。", "en": "São Paulo, Mexico City, took 15to reach that same interval. Now, what do these medium,large, mega-, and hypercities look like? What is their profile? Well, for one thing, they're young."}, {"zh-tw": "許多這些城市都出現年輕人口膨脹。這算是好消息。", "en": "What we're seeing in many of themis the rise of the youth bulge. Now, this is actually a good news story."}, {"zh-tw": "因為這意味著幼兒死亡率下降了。但是年輕人口膨脹，我們得小心看待。", "en": "It's a function of reductionsin child mortality rates. But the youth bulge is somethingwe've got to watch."}, {"zh-tw": "它基本上代表麼呢?生活在脆弱城市中的年輕人比例比其他更健康富裕的城市的比例要高得多。在某些脆弱的城市裡，75%人口年齡在30歲以下，", "en": "What it basically means is the proportion of young peopleliving in our fragile cities is much larger than those living in our healthier and wealthier ones. In some fragile cities, 75 percent of the populationis under the age of 30."}, {"zh-tw": "想想看每 4 個人就有 3 個人不到 30 歲，那就像是打了類固醇的「帕羅奧圖」市(美國加州之城市)", "en": "Think about that:Three in four people are under 30. It's like Palo Alto on steroids."}, {"zh-tw": "看看摩加迪休——東非索馬利首都在摩加迪休，平均年齡是16歲，達卡、帝力、喀布爾等也是如此，", "en": "Now, if you look at Mogadishu for example, in Mogadishu the mean age is 16 years old. Ditto for Dhaka, Dili and Kabul."}, {"zh-tw": "東京呢？平均年齡46歲！大部分西歐城市亦一樣。", "en": "And Tokyo? It's 46. Same for most Western European cities."}, {"zh-tw": "不是年輕人多就會帶來暴力。那是許多因素的其中一項，但如果年輕，再加上失業、缺乏教育，最要不得的是作為男性，這是一個最致命的前提，", "en": "Now, it's not just youththat necessarily predicts violence. That's one factor among many, but youthfulness combinedwith unemployment, lack of education, and -- this is the kicker -- being male, is a deadly proposition."}, {"zh-tw": "這些因素都是統計學上的相關因素這些風險因素發生在青年身上，會使暴力發生率上升。在座如果有兒子處於青少年階段，就會懂我的意思。想像你的男孩一點規矩也沒有，與那些不受管束的朋友一起，四處闖鬧。", "en": "They're statistically correlated,all those risk factors, with youth, and they tend to relateto increases in violence. Now, for those of you who areparents of teenage sons, you know what I'm talking about, right? Just imagine your boywithout any structure with those unruly friends of his,out there cavorting about."}, {"zh-tw": "再想像他們沒有了父母，沒有受到教育，教育機會受到限制，加一點毒品、酒水、槍械進來，想想他們會變成什麼樣子。後果可能是不堪設想的。", "en": "Now, take away the parents, take away the education,limit the education possibilities, sprinkle in a little bit of drugs,alcohol and guns, and sit back and watch the fireworks. The implications are disconcerting."}, {"zh-tw": "在巴西這邊預期壽命是73.6歲，如果你住在里約熱內盧的話抱歉，減兩歲。", "en": "Right here in Brazil,the life expectancy is 73.6 years. If you live in Rio, I'm sorry,shave off two right there."}, {"zh-tw": "但是如果你是年輕人、沒唸過書、找不到工作、黑人、又是男性，你的預期壽命要下降到60歲以下，年輕和暴力是這個國家的頭號殺手，這是有原因的。", "en": "But if you're young, you're uneducated, you lack employment,you're black, and you're male, your life expectancy dropsto less than 60 years old. There's a reason why youthfulnessand violence are the number one killers in this country."}, {"zh-tw": "我們的城市並不全然都是厄運和絕望，畢竟城市是創新的溫床，充滿活力、前景、刺激、人際關係。", "en": "Okay, so it's not all doomand gloom in our cities. After all, cities are hubs of innovation, dynamism, prosperity, excitement, connectivity."}, {"zh-tw": "它們是有腦筋的人的聚集之地，還有那些我剛提到的年輕人，他們比以前所有的人還要更精通數位、瞭解科技，", "en": "They're where the smart people gather. And those young people I just mentioned, they're more digitally savvyand tech-aware than ever before."}, {"zh-tw": "科技爆炸、網路、移動通信技術使南北部地區國家之間的數位技術差異逐步縮小，也使國內的數碼技術差異逐步縮小。不過就如同我們常聽到的，這些新科技是雙面刃，拿執法來舉例。", "en": "And this explosion, the Internet,and mobile technology, means that the digital divideseparating the North and the South between countriesand within them, is shrinking. But as we've heard so many times, these new technologiesare dual-edged, right? Take the case of law enforcement."}, {"zh-tw": "全球的警察開始使用遙感技術和海量數據來預測犯罪。一些警察能夠在犯罪發生前就預測到罪犯的暴力行為。", "en": "Police around the world are startingto use remote sensing and big data to anticipate crime. Some cops are able to predictcriminal violence before it even happens."}, {"zh-tw": "將來犯罪的場景，今天可以預見，我們得要小心注意，我們必須協調好公共安全問題防止個人隱私權利受到侵害。", "en": "The future crime scenario,it's here today, and we've got to be careful. We have to manage the issuesof the public safety against rights to individual privacy."}, {"zh-tw": "不過不只是警察們在革新，我們也聽過社會公民團體卓越的行動，參與了當地和國際串聯行動，那帶來了數位化的抗議和真實的革命。", "en": "But it's not just the copswho are innovating. We've heard extraordinary activitiesof civil society groups who are engaging in local and global collective action, and this is leading to digital protestand real revolution."}, {"zh-tw": "不過最令人擔憂的是犯罪團體利用網絡開始侵略網絡空間。在我工作的墨西哥華雷斯城，像是「賽塔斯」和「錫那羅亞」這些卡特爾組織團體正控制著社群媒體，", "en": "But most worryingof all are criminal gangs who are going onlineand starting to colonize cyberspace. In Ciudad Juárez in Mexico,where I've been working, groups like the Zetasand the Sinaloa cartel are hijacking social media."}, {"zh-tw": "他們利用社交媒體來招兵買馬，販賣他們的產品，脅迫、恐嚇和殺害他人。暴亂正要進入虛擬化，", "en": "They're using it to recruit,to sell their products, to coerce, to intimidate and to kill. Violence is going virtual."}, {"zh-tw": "現今形勢多變複雜這不過是其中一面。巨大風險還有許多，並且會直接影響我們時代的脆弱性，也會影響當今的收入不均、貧窮、氣候變化、罪犯逍遙法外等問題。", "en": "So this is just a partial sketch of a fast-moving and dynamicand complex situation. I mean, there are many other megarisks that are going to definefragility in our time, not least income inequality, poverty, climate change, impunity."}, {"zh-tw": "但我們面臨著一個嚴峻的窘境：有些城市會繁榮發展促進全球的進步，但也有城市會障礙重重拉大家的後腿。想要改變結局，我們就必需開始新對話，", "en": "But we're facing a stark dilemma where some cities are going to thriveand drive global growth and others are going to stumbleand pull it backwards. If we're going to change course,we need to start a conversation."}, {"zh-tw": "我們不能只注重那些成功的城市：像新加坡、吉隆坡、杜拜、上海等等，我們要與脆弱城市對話。", "en": "We can't only focuson those cities that work, the Singapores, the Kuala Lumpurs, the Dubais, the Shanghais. We've got to bring those fragile citiesinto the conversation."}, {"zh-tw": "方法之一可以是將我們較健康富有的城市與較脆弱的城市配對，展開學習與合作的過程，分享經驗，成功與失敗的經驗。一個很好的例子是薩爾瓦多和洛杉磯。聖薩爾瓦多市長和洛杉磯市長攜手合作讓從前的幫派份子與現在的幫派份子協力合作，給予他們引導與教育，在這個過程中幫助催生了停火和休戰協定，聖薩爾瓦多的兇殺率顯著下降了，過去世界上最暴力的城市，兇殺率下降五成。", "en": "One way to do this might beto start twinning our fragile cities with our healthierand wealthier ones, kickstarting a process of learningand collaboration and sharing of practices,of what works and what doesn't. A wonderful example of this is comingfrom El Salvador and Los Angeles, where the mayors in San Salvadorand Los Angeles are collaborating on getting ex-gang membersto work with current gang members, offering tutoring, education, and in the process are helpingincubate cease-fires and truces, and we've seen homicide ratesgo down in San Salvador, once the world's most violent city, by 50 percent."}, {"zh-tw": "我們也可以關注熱門城市、熱門地點。地點對城市暴力形成有著根本影響。", "en": "We can also focus on hot cities, but also hot spots. Place and location matter fundamentallyin shaping violence in our cities."}, {"zh-tw": "你是否知道在任一脆弱城市裡1 - 2%的街道地址可以預知到 99 %的暴力違法，以我工作過的聖保羅市為例，它從巴西最危險的城市變成最安全的，它做到如此是透過加倍於資訊蒐集、熱點標誌、警政改革等，僅 10 年過程中降低了70 %的謀殺率，", "en": "Did you know that betweenone and two percent of street addresses in any fragile city can predict up to 99 percentof violent crime? Take the case of São Paulo,where I've been working. It's gone from being Brazil's mostdangerous city to one of its safest, and it did this by doubling down on information collection,hot spot mapping, and police reform, and in the process, it dropped homicideby 70 percent in just over 10 years."}, {"zh-tw": "我們也鎖定了那些鋒頭人物。年輕、失業、無教育、男性雖然不幸，但卻可增加被人殺害或殺害他人的機率。", "en": "We also got to focus on those hot people. It's tragic, but being young,unemployed, uneducated, male, increases the risksof being killed and killing."}, {"zh-tw": "我們必須打斷這個暴力的循環，盡早與兒童和青年相處，給予認可而非將他們冠上惡名。最近我在致力的一項工作在牙買加的金士頓市，還有里約這裡，把教育、工作、娛樂帶給這些高風險人群，因此這些社區的暴力下降了。", "en": "We have to break this cycle of violence and get in there early with our children,our youngest children, and valorize them, not stigmatize them. There's wonderful work that's happeningthat I've been involved with in Kingston, Jamaicaand right here in Rio, which is putting education,employment, recreation up front for these high-risk groups, and as a result, we're seeing violencegoing down in their communities."}, {"zh-tw": "我們也發現城市變得更加安全，更加包容，更加宜居。事實是社會的團結很關鍵，", "en": "We've also got to make our cities safer,more inclusive, and livable for all. The fact is, social cohesion matters."}, {"zh-tw": "流動性在我們的城市很關鍵，我們必須要讓我們的城市遠離種族隔離、排斥他人的模式。", "en": "Mobility matters in our cities. We've got to get away from this modelof segregation, exclusion, and cities with walls."}, {"zh-tw": "一個很好的例子是麥德林。90 年代末期時我住在哥倫比亞，麥德林是當時世界經典的兇殺城市，但是這個城市後來改變了，因為刻意投資在低收入高暴力的地區與中等區域相整合，通過纜車網絡的接駁、大眾交通的聯繫、一流基礎設施的投入，該城市在此二十年內兇殺率下降79%。", "en": "My favorite example of how to do thiscomes from Medellín. When I lived in Colombiain the late 1990s, Medellín was the murder capital of the world, but it changed course, and it did this by deliberately investingin its low-income and most violent areas and integrating themwith the middle-class ones through a network of cable cars, of public transport,and first-class infrastructure, and in the process, it dropped homicideby 79 percent in just under two decades."}, {"zh-tw": "最後還有科技，科技具有絕佳的榮景，也有巨大的危害。", "en": "And finally, there's technology. Technology has enormouspromise but also peril."}, {"zh-tw": "我們在此見過不少了不起的創新例子，絕大部分是出自於這裡；警察參與了預測分析、市民致力於新的公眾解決方案。", "en": "We've seen examples hereof extraordinary innovation, and much of it coming from this room, The police are engaging in predictive analytics. Citizens are engagingin new crowdsourcing solutions."}, {"zh-tw": "我自己的隊伍也在開發程序，提供更多可信破案資訊，為市民帶來更多安全。可是我們得謹慎小心，", "en": "Even my own group is involvedin developing applications to provide more accountability over policeand increase safety among citizens. But we need to be careful."}, {"zh-tw": "如果我可以向您傳達一個訊息，那會是：致命的暴亂沒有說是不可避免的，我們可以讓我們的城市更安全，在座各位，我們現在有機會在我們有生之年將兇殺率減少一半。", "en": "If I have one singlemessage for you, it's this: There is nothing inevitableabout lethal violence, and we can make our cities safer.
