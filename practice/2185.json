Sol had whooping cough."}, {"zh-tw": "在房間裡經過一番討論經過很令人心痛的宣泄之後我記得我的總住院醫師曾經對我說：「好了，深呼吸，洗個臉吧現在才是最困難我們要向她的父母解釋。」那時候，我腦海裡出現很多問題從「怎麼一個彌月的嬰兒會這麼不幸？」到「我們是否能做些甚麼呢？」在疫苗出現之前很多傳染病每年奪去數百萬人的性命", "en": "After discussing the case in the roomand after a quite distressing catharsis, I remember my chief resident said to me, \"Okay, take a deep breath. Wash your face. And now comes the hardest part: We have to go talk to her parents.\" At that time, a thousand questionscame to mind, from, \"How could a one-month-oldbaby be so unfortunate?\" to, \"Could we have donesomething about it?\" Before vaccines existed, many infectious diseaseskilled millions of people per year."}, {"zh-tw": "1989年流感大流行時期5千萬人死亡比阿限廷現在的人口還多", "en": "During the 1918 flu pandemic 50 million people died. That's greater than Argentina'scurrent population."}, {"zh-tw": "或許，在座有年紀大一點的會記得1956年在阿限廷發生了一場小兒麻痺流行病在那時候，沒有適合的疫苗對抗小兒麻痺", "en": "Perhaps, the older ones among youremember the polio epidemic that occurred in Argentina in 1956. At that time, there was no vaccineavailable against polio."}, {"zh-tw": "人們都無計可施他們都快要被迫瘋了他們用生石灰畫樹", "en": "People didn't know what to do.They were going crazy. They would go painting treeswith caustic lime."}, {"zh-tw": "他們將小包的樟腦放進小孩的內衣褲裡彷彿可以產生一些作用在這場小兒麻痺流行病中有幾千人死亡", "en": "They'd put little bags of camphor in their children's underwear,as if that could do something. During the polio epidemic,thousands of people died."}, {"zh-tw": "另外有數千人患有影響非常大的神經損害後遺症我是因為閱讀而知道這事件的因為感激疫苗的出現我們這世代很幸運不用經歷像那樣恐怖的流行病", "en": "And thousands of people were leftwith very significant neurological damage. I know this because I read about it, because thanks to vaccines,my generation was lucky to not live through an epidemicas terrible as this."}, {"zh-tw": "疫苗是20世紀公眾健康其中一個很大的成就自從有了可飲用的水對降低死亡率有很大的幫助甚至比抗生素還大", "en": "Vaccines are one of the great successesof the 20th century's public health. After potable water, they are the interventionsthat have most reduced mortality, even more than antibiotics."}, {"zh-tw": "疲苗杜絕地球上很多可怕的疾病例如天花更成功大大地降低因其他疾病造成的死亡率，例如麻疹百日咳、小兒麻痺，還有更多以上所有疾病都被視為疫苗可預防疾病", "en": "Vaccines eradicated terrible diseasessuch as smallpox from the planet and succeeded in significantlyreducing mortality due to other diseases such as measles, whooping cough, polio and many more. All these diseases are consideredvaccine-preventable diseases."}, {"zh-tw": "這是甚麼意思呢？即是它們是可預防的但要預防，必需做一點東西你需要接種疫苗", "en": "What does this mean? That they are potentially preventable, but in order to be so,something must be done. You need to get vaccinated."}, {"zh-tw": "我經常想，如果今天我們都不在這兒在我們人生中某個時候接種疫苗現在，我不確定我們當中多少人知道長大成人後應該接受哪上疫苗或增壓劑", "en": "I imagine that most,if not all of us here today, received a vaccineat some point in our life. Now, I'm not so sure that many of us know which vaccines or boosterswe should receive after adolescence."}, {"zh-tw": "你有沒有曾經想過當我們接種疫苗時我們正在保護誰？我究竟想帶出甚麼意思？除了保護我們自身有沒有帶來其他影響？讓我告訴你一些事試想像現在這一刻我們身處在一個城市裡那裡從沒有發生任何一種疾病譬如麻疹", "en": "Have you ever wonderedwho we are protecting when we vaccinate? What do I mean by that? Is there any other effectbeyond protecting ourselves? Let me show you something. Imagine for a moment that we are in a city that has never had a caseof a particular disease, such as the measles."}, {"zh-tw": "即是說在城市裡無一曾經和疾病扯上關係無一擁有天然防禦力能或者曾接種疫苗對抗麻疹", "en": "This would mean that no one in the cityhas ever had contact with the disease. No one has natural defenses against,nor been vaccinated against measles."}, {"zh-tw": "假若有一天，這個城市出現麻疹有一個人染了病這個疾病的抗性不高它會開始人傳人而且很快就會廣泛地傳播到整個社區在一段時間之後很大部分的人都會染病", "en": "If one day, a person sick with the measlesappears in this city the disease won't find much resistance and will begin spreadingfrom person to person, and in no time it will disseminatethroughout the community.

Now, imagine the complete opposite case."}, {"zh-tw": "我們身處在一個城市那兒有超過9成人口對麻疹是有防禦能力的意思即是要不他們是曾經患有麻疹，幸而存活有了自然的抵抗力要不就是他們本身就已經對麻疹免疫假如有一天城裡有一個人罹患麻疹疾病的抗性較高不會那麼容易在人與人之間傳播", "en": "We are in a city where more than 90 percentof the population has defenses againstthe measles, which means that they either had the disease,survived, and developed natural defenses; or that they had beenimmunized against measles. If one day, a person sick with the measlesappears in this city, the disease will find much more resistance and won't be transmittedthat much from person to person."}, {"zh-tw": "病情就可以受到控制麻疹的爆發亦不會發生我想請你們注意一點", "en": "The spread will probably remain contained and a measles outbreak won't happen. I would like youto pay attention to something."}, {"zh-tw": "已接種疫苗的人不單止保障了他們自身更加阻止了疾病在社區內散播他們間接保障了社區裡的未接種疫苗人他們創造了一個保護屏障來避免疾病闖進接觸到人們因此那些人受到保障", "en": "People who are vaccinated are not only protecting themselves, but by blocking the disseminationof the disease within the community, they are indirectly protectingthe people in this community who are not vaccinated. They create a kind of protective shield which prevents them fromcoming in contact with the disease, so that these people are protected."}, {"zh-tw": "這一種由已接種疫苗的人包圍群體內未接種的人令他們簡單地得到的間接保護叫群體免疫有很多在社群裡的人幾乎只靠這種群體免疫來對抗疾病", "en": "This indirect protection that the unvaccinated peoplewithin a community receive simply by being surroundedby vaccinated people, is called herd immunity. Many people in the community depend almost exclusivelyon this herd immunity to be protected against disease."}, {"zh-tw": "你見到圖像裡未接種疫苗的人不只是個假設那些人是我們的姪女姪兒、我們的孩子他們都可能因為年紀太小而不能接受首次疫苗注射", "en": "The unvaccinated people you seein infographics are not just hypothetical. Those people are our niecesand nephews, our children, who may be too youngto receive their first shots."}, {"zh-tw": "那些人或會是我們的父母、兄弟姊妹我們認識的人卻患有疾病或者接受了藥劑反而會減低他們的防禦能力此外還有一些對於某種疫苗會過敏的人", "en": "They are our parents, our siblings, our acquaintances, who may have a disease, or take medicationthat lowers their defenses. There are also people who areallergic to a particular vaccine."}, {"zh-tw": "甚至在我們當中有些人注射了疫苗但是疫苗達不到預期的效果因為不是所有疫苗都百分之百有效這些人全部都幾乎只靠群體免疫來對抗疾病", "en": "They could even be among us, any of us who got vaccinated, but the vaccine didn't producethe expected effect, because not all vaccinesare always 100 percent effective. All these people dependalmost exclusively on herd immunity to be protected against diseases."}, {"zh-tw": "要實現群體免疫的效用必需要很大的人口比例接種疫苗這個比例叫作閾值數", "en": "To achieve this effect of herd immunity, it is necessary that a large percentageof the population be vaccinated. This percentage is called the threshold."}, {"zh-tw": "閾值數取決於很多變數取決於種的特性和疫苗產生的免疫反應但他們都有一個共通點", "en": "The threshold depends on many variables: It depends on the germ's characteristics, and those of the immune responsethat the vaccine generates. But they all have something in common."}, {"zh-tw": "那就是，如果已接種疫苗社區的人口比例低於這個閾值數疾病會更自由無礙地擴散可能會導致該社區爆發疫症即使之前已受控的疾病都可能再出現", "en": "If the percentage of the populationin a vaccinated community is below this threshold number, the disease will beginto spread more freely and may generate an outbreakof this disease within the community. Even diseases which were at some point controlled may reappear."}, {"zh-tw": "這個不止是理論是有發生過，而且仍然在發生", "en": "This is not just a theory. This has happened,and is still happening."}, {"zh-tw": "在1998年，一個英國研究者於其中一本很重要的醫學期刊中刊登了一篇論文當中提及專門預防麻疹、腮腺炎及風疹的麻腮風三聯疫苗跟自閉症有關這產生了即時性的影響", "en": "In 1998, a British researcherpublished an article in one of the most importantmedical journals, saying that the MMR vaccine, which is given for measles,mumps and rubella, was associated with autism. This generated an immediate impact."}, {"zh-tw": "人們開始停止接種疫苗，更不讓他們的孩子接種疫苗然後結果呢？全世界很多國家接種疫苗的人數下跌至低於閾值數", "en": "People began to stop getting vaccinated,and stopped vaccinating their children. And what happened? The number of people vaccinated, in many communities around the world,fell below this threshold."}, {"zh-tw": "世界各國 — 美國、歐洲都爆發麻疹很多人患病", "en": "And there were outbreaks of measlesin many cities in the world -- in the U.S., in Europe. Many people got sick."}, {"zh-tw": "很多人死於麻疹之後怎樣呢？那篇論文在醫學界亦牽起了巨大的轟動", "en": "People died of measles. What happened? This article also generated a huge stirwithin the medical community."}, {"zh-tw": "許多研究人員開始著手評估這是否屬實不單沒有一個找到麻腮風三聯疫苗與人口水平上自閉症的因果關係更加發現那篇論文存在不實的言論", "en": "Dozens of researchers began to assessif this was actually true. Not only could no one find a causal association between MMRand autism at the population level, but it was also found that this articlehad incorrect claims."}, {"zh-tw": "更甚的是，它是騙人的是欺詐的", "en": "Even more, it was fraudulent. It was fraudulent."}, {"zh-tw": "事實上，在2010年該期刊公開聲明收回那篇論文其中一個主要的顧慮和不接種疫苗的藉口是不利的影響", "en": "In fact, the journal publicly retractedthe article in 2010. One of the main concerns and excusesfor not getting vaccinated are the adverse effects."}, {"zh-tw": "疫苗，就像其他藥物可以帶來潛在的反面影響多數是溫和及短暫的", "en": "Vaccines, like other drugs,can have potential adverse effects. Most are mild and temporary."}, {"zh-tw": "但益處一般都比可能存在的併發症多當我們患病，一定要盡快醫治", "en": "But the benefits are always greaterthan possible complications. When we are ill,we want to heal fast."}, {"zh-tw": "許多人當被感染到傳染病時會服食抗生素當高血壓時服用降壓藥有時候服食心臟藥為甚麼呢？因為我們生病，需要盡快治理", "en": "Many of us who are here take antibioticswhen we have an infection, we take anti-hypertensiveswhen we have high blood pressure, we take cardiac medications. Why? Because we are sickand we want to heal fast."}, {"zh-tw": "我們不會對此存疑那為甚麼當我們健康的時候將預防疾病當作是照顧自己一樣就變得這麼困難呢？在我們患病時或者在危難迫近眉睫的情形時我們懂得好好照顧自己", "en": "And we don't question it much. Why is it so difficultto think of preventing diseases, by taking care of ourselveswhen we are healthy? We take care of ourselves a lotwhen affected by an illness, or in situations of imminent danger."}, {"zh-tw": "我想在座各位很多都記得2009年在阿根廷及世界各地爆發的流感大流行當時第一批感染個案曝光時我們在阿根廷正在步入冬季", "en": "I imagine most of us here, remember the influenza-A pandemic which broke out in 2009in Argentina and worldwide.

People would line upin pharmacies to get a vaccine, without even knowingif it was the right vaccine that would protect themagainst this new virus."}, {"zh-tw": "我們完全是一無所知當時，我除了處理我在嬰幼兒基金會研究金的審查我還在一間預付醫藥公司當家庭兒科醫生", "en": "We knew absolutely nothing.

It was chaos;people didn't know what to do."}, {"zh-tw": "我還記得我很留意為哪些類型的病人作檢查那些病人比我們往常在冬季見到的年紀大一點發燒的時間較長一點", "en": "I remember the types of patientsthat I was examining. The patients were a little older thanwhat we were used to seeing in winter, with longer fevers."}, {"zh-tw": "我向我研究金的導師提及這一點他亦從他的同事聽聞過相同的情況大量孕婦及年輕成人正在深切治療部留醫他們的臨床資料被歸類為複雜個案在那時候，我們著手瞭解究竟發生甚麼事", "en": "And I mentioned thatto my fellowship mentor, and he, for his part, had heardthe same from a colleague, about the large numberof pregnant women and young adults being hospitalized in intensive care, with hard-to-manage clinical profiles.
