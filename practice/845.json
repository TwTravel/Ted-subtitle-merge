And the answer is, simply, that if I hold up three fingers, you can count that easily, but if I hold up this, it's sort of hard to say that I just did seven. The virtue of binary is that it's the simplest possible way of representing numbers.", "en": " 問題是：為什麼使用二進位 會比使用阿拉伯數字簡單？ 答案很簡單： 如果我伸出三根指頭，你能輕易的數 但如果是這個 要說我剛才比了個七可不容易 二進位的好處是：它是表示數字 最簡單的辦法"}, {"zh-tw": " Anything else is more complicated. You can catch errors with it, it's unambiguous in its reading, there are lots of good things about binary.", "en": " 其它都更複雜 二進位很容易找到錯誤 只有一種解讀法 二進位系統有許多好處"}, {"zh-tw": " So it is very, very simple once you learn how to read it.

The two blobs that are light in the middle there are the United States and Europe.", "en": " 這兒有一張跨洲位元流動圖 中間有兩個發亮的區塊 是美國和歐洲"}, {"zh-tw": " And then back to simplicity again. So here we have what I think is one of the great ideas, which is Google.", "en": " 現在回到「簡單」這個話題 我認為最偉大的想法之一 就是Google"}, {"zh-tw": " Which, in this simple portal makes the claim that it makes accessible all of the world's information.

The characteristics, which I think are useful to think about for simple things: First, they are predictable.", "en": " 好吧，讓我用 四個表述、一個例子 兩句箴言來 總結我認為簡單的東西 所具有的特性： 首先，它們都是可預測的"}, {"zh-tw": " Their behavior is predictable. Now, one of the nice characteristics of simple things is you know what it's going to do, in general.", "en": " 其行為是可預測的 簡單的東西 具有的特性之一 是你通常知道它會做什麼"}, {"zh-tw": " So simplicity and predictability are characteristics of simple things. The second is, and this is a real world statement, they're cheap.", "en": " 那麼，簡單的東西具有 「簡單」和「可預測」的特性 其次，這是現實面的表述 它們很便宜"}, {"zh-tw": " If you have things that are cheap enough, people will find uses for them, even if they seem very primitive. So, for example, stones.", "en": " 東西如果夠便宜 即使看起來非常原始 人們就會為它們找到用途 以石頭為例"}, {"zh-tw": " You can build cathedrals out of stones, you just have to know what it does. You carve them in blocks and then you pile them on top of one another, and they support weight.", "en": " 石頭可用來建造大教堂 只要知道它的性質 把石頭切成石塊 再一塊一塊堆起來 它們就能承受重量"}, {"zh-tw": " So there has to be function, the function has to be predictable and the cost has to be low. What that means is that you have to have a high performance or value for cost.", "en": " 那麼，只要可預測功能 而且成本低廉 換句話說 要有高效益 即價值和成本必須成比例"}, {"zh-tw": " And then I would propose as this last component that they serve, or have the potential to serve, as building blocks. That is, you can stack them.", "en": " 我提出的 最後一個部份是 要提供服務或具有服務潛能 像建築石塊一般 也就是可以堆疊起來"}, {"zh-tw": " And stack can mean this way, or it can mean this way, or it can mean in some arbitrary n-dimensional space.

This is a world in which there's no electricity, there's no money, there's no medical competence.
