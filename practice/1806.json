Here's why. Back in university,we had a quick project to design some solar-powered clocks.", "en": " Chris 是我大學時一個很好的朋友 但我私底下很討厭他 理由是在大學時我們有一個小的專案 要設計一些利用太陽能驅動的時鐘"}, {"zh-tw": " Here's my clock. It uses something calledthe dwarf sunflower, which grows to about 12 inches in height.", "en": " 這是我的時鐘 利用一種叫做矮種向日葵做的 矮種向日葵大概 12 英吋高"}, {"zh-tw": " Now, as you know, sunflowers track the sunduring the course of the day. So in the morning, you seewhich direction the sunflower is facing, and you mark it on the blankarea in the base.", "en": " 你也知道向日葵 會追隨著太陽的方向 所以早晨時，你看向日葵朝著哪個方向 就在底座空白處作記號"}, {"zh-tw": " At noon, you mark the changedposition of the sunflower, and in the evening again,and that's your clock. Now, I know my clock doesn'ttell you the exact time, but it does give you a generalidea using a flower.", "en": " 正午時，記下向日葵改變的方向 同樣地，傍晚時也一樣，這就是你的時鐘 我知道我的時鐘無法告訴你精確的時間 但它利用花來告訴你一個大方向"}, {"zh-tw": " So, in my completely unbiased,subjective opinion, it's brilliant. However, here's Chris's clock.", "en": " 所以以我毫無偏見、主觀的立場 我覺得這棒極了 可是呢，這是Chris 的時鐘"}, {"zh-tw": " It's five magnifying glasseswith a shot glass under each one. In each shot glassis a different scented oil.", "en": " 用了五個放大鏡，每個放大鏡下方都放了一個烈酒杯 每個烈酒杯裡有不同的香氛精油"}, {"zh-tw": " In the morning, the sunlightwill shine down on the first magnifying glass, focusing a beam of lighton the shot glass underneath.

To do this, I devised somethingcalled the five senses graph.", "en": " 我決定以五感的角度 來分析評估我生活中的各種經驗 為此，我發明了五感圖表"}, {"zh-tw": " Along the y-axis, you havea scale from zero to 10, and along the x-axis, you have,of course, the five senses. Anytime I had a memorableexperience in my life, I would record it on this graphlike a five senses diary.", "en": " Y 軸的數值範圍從 0 到 10 X 軸就是五種不同的感官感受 每當我有難忘的生活經歷 我就會標記在圖表上，像是個五感日記"}, {"zh-tw": " Here's a quick videoto show you how it works. (Video) Jinsop Lee: Hey, my name's Jinsop, and today, I'm going to showyou what riding motorbikes is like from the point of viewof the five senses. Hey! Bike designer: This is [unclear],custom bike designer.", "en": " 這裡有個說明使用方法的短片 Jinsop Lee︰「嗨，我是 Jinsop， 今天我要和你分享 以五感的角度去了解騎重機的感覺」 重機設計者︰「我是（不清楚），客製重型機車的設計師」"}, {"zh-tw": " (Motorcyle revving) [Sound] [Touch] [Sight] [Smell] [Taste] JL: And that's how the five sensesgraph works. Now, for a period of three years,I gathered data, not just me but also some of my friends, and I used to teachin university, so I forced my -- I mean, I asked my studentsto do this as well.", "en": " （引擎聲響） （聽覺） （觸覺） （視覺） （嗅覺） （味覺） Jinsop Lee︰「這就是五感圖表作用的方式」 我花了三年的時間蒐集資料 不只我在蒐集，還有我的一些朋友們 我曾經在大學裡任教，所以我強迫... 我是說，我請我的學生也這麼做"}, {"zh-tw": " So here are some other results. The first is for instant noodles.", "en": " 這就是我們蒐集的結果 第一個，速食麵"}, {"zh-tw": " Now obviously, tasteand smell are quite high, but notice sound is at three. Many people told me a big part of the noodle-eating experienceis the slurping noise.", "en": " 顯然地，味覺與嗅覺的等級都相當高 但聽覺只有3 很多人告訴我，吃速食麵的聽覺經驗 大部分是吸麵的噪音"}, {"zh-tw": " You know. (Slurps) Needless to say, I no longerdine with these people. OK, next, clubbing.", "en": " 你知道的（吸食麵條的聲音） 不用說，我再也不跟那些人一起吃飯 好，下一個，跑趴"}, {"zh-tw": " OK, here what I found interesting was that taste is at four,and many respondents told me it's because of the taste of drinks, but also, in some cases, kissing is a bigpart of the clubbing experience. These people I still do hang out with.", "en": " 這是我發現有趣的地方 跑趴味覺是 4，很多受訪者告訴我 那是酒精性飲料的味覺感受 但是，就某些情況而言，接吻也佔了跑趴經驗的一大部分 我仍和這些受訪者們一起玩"}, {"zh-tw": " All right, and smoking. Here I found touch is at [six],and one of the reasons is that smokers told me the sensationof holding a cigarette and bringing it up to your lips is a bigpart of the smoking experience, which shows, it's kind of scary to think how well cigarettes are designedby the manufacturers.", "en": " 好吧，那麼吸煙呢 我發現吸煙的觸覺感受是 6，原因之一 是吸煙者告訴我說，拿著煙， 把煙送上雙唇間，是吸煙時的重點 那表示，感覺有點駭人地， 香煙製造商把香煙設計的多麼的好啊"}, {"zh-tw": " OK. Now, what would the perfectexperience look like on the five senses graph? It would, of course, bea horizontal line along the top. Now you can see, noteven as intense an experience as riding a motorbike comes close.", "en": " 好吧，這些完美經驗 在五感圖表上是如何呈現的呢？ 如果可以，它當然是條位在頂端的水平線 但你可以看到，即使是強烈的騎重機經驗 都無法達到五感都位居頂端的水平線"}, {"zh-tw": " In fact, in the yearsthat I gathered data, only one experience came closeto being the perfect one. That is, of course, sex. Great sex.", "en": " 事實上，在我蒐集資料的那些年 只有一種經歷可以最接近完美的五感經驗 那就是性愛，絕佳的性愛"}, {"zh-tw": " Respondents said that great sex hits all of the five sensesat an extreme level. Here I'll quoteone of my students who said, \"Sex is so good, it's goodeven when it's bad.\" So the five sensestheory does help explain why sex is so good.", "en": " 受訪者說絕佳的性愛 衝擊所有的五官感受到極端的程度 在此我要引用我學生所言︰ 「性愛如此美好，就算不愉悅的性愛也是美好的」 所以五感理論的確解釋了 為何性愛如此美好"}, {"zh-tw": " Now in the middle of all thisfive senses work, I suddenly rememberedthe solar-powered clocks project from my youth. And I realized this theoryalso explains why Chris's clock is so much better than mine.", "en": " 現在在我做的這個五官感受的工作中 我突然想起了 年輕時做的太陽能驅動時鐘專案 我發現，五感理論也說明了 為何 Chris 設計的時鐘比我的還好"}, {"zh-tw": " You see, my clock only focuses on sight, and a little bit of touch. Here's Chris's clock.", "en": " 你看，我設計的時鐘主要針對視覺 還有一點點觸覺 但 Chris 的時鐘"}, {"zh-tw": " It's the first clock everthat uses smell to tell the time. In fact, in terms of the five senses, Chris's clock is a revolution.", "en": " 卻是前所未有地讓人「嗅」到時間 事實上，基於五種感官感受 Chris 的時鐘是一種革命"}, {"zh-tw": " And that's what this theorytaught me about my field. You see, up till now, us designers, we've mainly focused on makingthings look very pretty, and a little bit of touch, which means we've ignoredthe other three senses.", "en": " 而那正是在我的領域裡，這個理論教我的東西 你看看現在我們這些設計師 我們大多專注在讓東西看起來很好看 再加上一些觸感 那也就是說，我們忽略其他三種感官的感受"}, {"zh-tw": " Chris's clock shows usthat even raising just one of those other senses canmake for a brilliant product. So what if we started usingthe five senses theory in all of our designs? Here's three quick ideas I came up with.", "en": " Chris 的時鐘告訴我們，藉由提昇任一個感官的感受 我們就可以創造出傑出的作品 那假設我們開始把五感設計理論 融入我們所有的設計當中呢？ 接下來是我想出的三個點子"}, {"zh-tw": " This is an iron, youknow, for your clothes, to which I added a spraying mechanism, so you fill up the vialwith your favorite scent, and your clothes will smell nicer, but hopefully it should also make the ironing experience more enjoyable. We could call this \"the perfumator.\" All right, next.", "en": " 這是熨斗，燙衣服用的熨斗 我添加了一個噴氣功能 你會在蒸水瓶裡添加你喜歡的香氣 然後你燙過的衣服就聞更好聞 且同時你在熨燙衣服的過程 也會是個很享受的經驗 我們就稱之為「香味製造器」 好，下一個"}, {"zh-tw": " So I brush my teeth twice a day, and what if we had a toothbrush that tastes like candy, and when the taste of candy ran out, you'd know it's timeto change your toothbrush? Finally, I have a thing for the keyson a flute or a clarinet. It's not just the way they look,but I love the way they feel when you press down on them.", "en": " 我一天刷兩次牙 如果，我有個嚐起來 像糖果的牙刷呢？ 然後當它再也沒有糖果的甜味時 就表示該換牙刷了？ 最後，我對長笛或黑管的按鍵有特殊的喜好 它不僅好看，我更愛那按下它的觸感 它不僅好看，我更愛那按下它的觸感"}, {"zh-tw": " Now, I don't play the fluteor the clarinet, so I decided to combine these keyswith an instrument I do play: the television remote control. Now, when we look at thesethree ideas together, you'll notice that the five senses theory doesn't only change the waywe use these products but also the way they look.", "en": " 我現在不再吹奏長笛或黑管了 所以我決定把那按鍵與我每天都會按的器具結合 電視遙控器 好了，綜合以上三個例子 你會發現五感理論 不僅改變我們使用產品的方式 也改變了產品的外觀"}, {"zh-tw": " So in conclusion, I've foundthe five senses theory to be a very useful tool in evaluating different experiences in my life, and then taking those best experiences and hopefully incorporatingthem into my designs. Now, I realize the five sensesisn't the only thing that makes life interesting.", "en": " 結論是，我發現五感理論 對於分析我生活中各式各樣的經驗 是非常有用的工具 並且希望把我最好的經驗融入我的設計當中 並且希望把我最好的經驗融入我的設計當中 現在我明瞭五個感官的感受 不僅增添生活的趣味"}, {"zh-tw": " There's also the six emotions and that elusive x-factor. Maybe that could bethe topic of my next talk.", "en": " 還有六種情緒 和那難以預料的不確定因素 這也許會成為我下一個演講的主題"}, {"zh-tw": " Until then, please have fun using the five senses in your own lives and your own designs. Oh, one last thing before I leave.", "en": " 在那之前，請盡情 把五感融入你的生活 和你的設計當中 喔，在我結束之前還有最後一件事"}, {"zh-tw": " Here's the experience youall had while listening to the TED Talks. However, it would be betterif we could boost up a couple of the other senseslike smell and taste.", "en": " 這是你們聽 TED 演講時的經驗 這是你們聽 TED 演講時的經驗 然而，如果我們能增加像嗅覺和味覺 這兩種感官經驗那會更好"}, {"zh-tw": " And the best way to do that is with free candy. You guys ready? All right.", "en": " 要達到這一點的最佳妙方就是 免費的糖果 準備好了嗎？ 好的"}], "title": "Jinsop Lee Design For All 5 Senses"}
