I'd like to share a couple with you today."}, {"zh-tw": "我的第一個發明是個算命 App，叫做\"看天吃飯\"螢幕上，地球不同的顏色變化代表著不同的運勢而令我最得意的發明叫做\"小 假斯汀\"它是一款惡搞小賈斯汀的打地鼠遊戲", "en": "My first app was a uniquefortune teller called \"Earth Fortune\" that would displaydifferent colors of Earth depending on what your fortune was. My favorite and most successful app is \"Bustin Jieber,\" which is -- which is a Justin Bieber whack-a-mole."}, {"zh-tw": "因為學校裡很多同學都不喜歡小賈斯汀所以我才決定要做這個 App於是我開始寫程式並趕在 2010 年暑假前發表", "en": "I created it becausea lot of people at school disliked Justin Bieber a little bit, so I decided to make the app. So I went to work programming it, and I released itjust before the holidays in 2010."}, {"zh-tw": "很多人都會問我怎麼發明這些 App？通常，會問這類問題的人多半也想嘗試看看現代小孩子都很愛玩遊戲但他們更想自己做遊戲只是很難因為沒有管道孩子們不知道去哪裡學寫程式", "en": "A lot of people ask me,how did I make these? A lot of times it's becausethe person who asked the question wants to make an app also. A lot of kids these dayslike to play games, but now they want to make them,and it's difficult, because not many kids know where to goto find out how to make a program."}, {"zh-tw": "大家都知道想學足球可以加入足球隊想學小提琴可以參加小提琴班", "en": "I mean, for soccer,you could go to a soccer team. For violin, you could getlessons for a violin."}, {"zh-tw": "但如果是要學做 App 呢？父母小時候可能踢過足球拉過小提琴多少可以教孩子一點但有多少父母小時候寫過 App 呢？那到底要上哪學做 App 呢？接下來我要分享我的親身經驗", "en": "But what if you want to make an app? And the kid's parents might have donesome of these things when they were young, but not many parents have written apps. Where do you go to find outhow to make an app? Well, this is how I approached it,this is what I did."}, {"zh-tw": "首先，我已經熟用多種程式語言奠定基本功像是 Python、C、Java 等程式語不久，蘋果推出 iPhoneiPhone 軟體開發工具也隨之問世這是一款專門製作 iPhone App 的工具", "en": "First of all, I've been programmingin multiple other programming languages to get the basics down, such as Python, C, Java, etc. And then Apple released the iPhone, and with it, the iPhonesoftware development kit, and the software development kitis a suite of tools for creating and programmingan iPhone app."}, {"zh-tw": "讓我可以天馬行空、激發無限可能一番摸索之後我做了一些 App，並做了測試其中一個叫 \"看天吃飯\"因為我很想把它放上 App 商店我就說服了爸媽幫我繳 99 元的註冊費 （美金）", "en": "This opened up a whole new worldof possibilities for me, and after playing with the softwaredevelopment kit a little bit, I made a couple of apps,I made some test apps. One of them happened to be\"Earth Fortune,\" and I was ready to put\"Earth Fortune\" on the App Store, and so I persuaded my parentsto pay the 99 dollar fee to be able to put my appson the App Store."}, {"zh-tw": "我的 App 就這樣上市了我的父母、朋友和老师給了我很多靈感和鼓勵甚至連那些 Apple Store 用戶都給我莫大的幫助", "en": "They agreed, and now I haveapps on the App Store.

There's these programscalled the iPad Pilot Program, and some districts have them."}, {"zh-tw": "我很有幸是其中一員期間所面臨的最大挑戰是如何妥善利用 iPad以及哪些 App 適合 iPad所以，我們會徵詢老師的意見看他們偏好哪些 App", "en": "I'm fortunate enough to be part of one. A big challenge is,how should the iPads be used, and what apps should we put on the iPads? So we're getting feedbackfrom teachers at the school to see what kind of apps they'd like."}, {"zh-tw": "設計好的 App 售出之後付費地區就可免費使用而其收入則捐給當地的教育機構這年頭，學生的科技新知往往比老師發達一點", "en": "When we design the app and we sell it, it will be free to local districts;and other districts that we sell to -- all the money from that will gointo the local ed foundations. These days, students usually knowa little bit more than teachers with the technology."}, {"zh-tw": "如此看來不好意思所以，這就是老師的資源教育工作者應該意識到這點並善加利用它", "en": "So -- Sorry.
