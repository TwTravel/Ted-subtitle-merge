My friend says I looklike a French anarchist -- But this is still what I see when I look in the mirror in the morning.", "en": " 這照片 是我捷運卡上的照片， 當時是 90 年代中期，我在巴黎的大學留學一年。 朋友說我看起來像個法國無政府主義者 但他仍是早晨攬鏡自照時我所看見的自己。"}, {"zh-tw": " Within a month of living in Paris,I'd lost 15 pounds and I was in the best shape of my life because I was eating fresh food and I was walking wherever I went. Having grown up in suburban Atlanta, a region built largelyby highways and automobiles and with a reputationas a poster child for sprawl, Paris fundamentally changedthe way I understood the construction of the world around me, and I got obsessed with the roleof infrastructure -- that it's not just the way to move peoplefrom point A to point B, it's not just the way to convey wateror sewage or energy, but it's the foundation for our economy.", "en": " 住在巴黎的頭一個月我瘦了 15 磅， 是一生中身材最好的時候， 因為我總是食用新鮮食物， 並且到任何地方都安步當車。 我在亞特蘭大的郊區長大， 當地主要依汽車和公路而建， 是個城市擴張建設的樣板。 巴黎徹底改變了我對於周遭建設的認知。 從此我迷上了基礎設施的角色 -- 它不僅被用來把人們從甲地送到乙地， 也不只運輸淨水、污水或能源， 而是我們經濟的基礎。"}, {"zh-tw": " It's the foundation for our social lifeand for our culture, and it really mattersto the way that we live. When I came home,I was instantly frustrated, stuck in traffic as I crossedthe top end of our perimeter highway.", "en": " 它是我們社交生活和文化的基礎， 與我們的生活方式息息相關。 回到家鄉的那一刻我立即感到沮喪， 被堵在環城公路的路口上。"}, {"zh-tw": " Not only was I not moving a muscle, I had no social interaction with the hundreds of thousands of peoplethat were hurtling past me, like me, with their eyes faced forwardand their music blaring. I wondered if this wasan inevitable outcome, or could we do something about it.", "en": " 我不僅僅沒移動任何一塊肌肉， 而且與身旁成千上萬匆匆而過的人們沒任何互動； 他們和我一樣，直視著前方，耳中充斥著樂聲。 我在想，這是不可避免的結果嗎？ 還是我們能做些改變呢？"}, {"zh-tw": " Was it possible to transformthis condition in Atlanta into the kind of placethat I wanted to live in? I went back to grad schoolin architecture and city planning, developed this interest in infrastructure, and in 1999 came up with an idea for my thesis project: the adaptation of an obsolete loopof old railroad circling downtown as a new infrastructurefor urban revitalization. It was just an idea.", "en": " 有沒有可能把亞特蘭大的環境 變成我想居住的那種樣貌呢？ 我回到建築和城市設計研究所， 對基礎設施產生了興趣， 在 1999 年想好了論文的題目： 把環繞市中心的廢舊鐵路 改建成復甦城市的新基礎建設。 當時那只是個想法。"}, {"zh-tw": " I never thoughtwe would actually build it. But I went to workat an architecture firm, and eventually talkedto my coworkers about it, and they loved the idea.", "en": " 從未想過我們真會實踐它。 我任職於一家建築公司， 後來和同事談起， 他們很喜愛這個想法。"}, {"zh-tw": " And as we started talkingto more people about it, more people wanted to hear about it. In the summer of 2001, we connected with Cathy Woolard, who was soon electedcity council president.", "en": " 我們開始與更多人分享這想法， 越來越多的人想瞭解這想法。 在 2001 年夏天， 我們與凱西 ･ 伍拉德 取得聯繫， 不久後，她被選為市議會議長。"}, {"zh-tw": " And we built a citywide visionaround this idea: the Atlanta BeltLine, a 22-mile loop of transit and trails and transformation. I was doing two and three meetings a weekfor two and a half years, and so was Cathy and her staffand a handful of volunteers.", "en": " 我們就此想法建立了全市的願景： 一條 22 英里長，用來運輸、通行和轉型的「亞特蘭大環線」。 在兩年半的期間裡我每週要開兩三次會， 凱西、她的員工和一些志願者也是。"}, {"zh-tw": " Together, we built this amazing movementof people and ideas. It included community advocateswho were used to fighting against things, but found the Atlanta BeltLineas something that they could fight for; developers who saw the opportunity to take advantage of a lotof new growth in the city; and dozens of nonprofit partnerswho saw their mission at least partly accomplishedby the shared vision.", "en": " 我們共同啟動了美妙的人們與想法： 包括了原先鼓吹抵制的社區者， 如今知道亞特蘭大環線是他們能夠爭取的， 見到能從新的城市增長契機中獲利的建商， 和數十家非營利性的合作夥伴， 他們看到能經由合作共同的願景而達成部分的自身使命。"}, {"zh-tw": " Now, usually these groups of peoplearen't at the same table wanting the same outcome. But there we were,and it was kind of weird, but it was really, really powerful.", "en": " 一般說來，這些人是不會聚集一堂尋求共同結果的。 雖然奇怪，但我們聚在一起， 力量非常的強大。"}, {"zh-tw": " The people of Atlantafell in love with a vision that was better than what they sawthrough their car windshields, and the people of Atlanta made it happen, and I guarantee you we would notbe building it otherwise. From the beginning,our coalition was diverse.", "en": " 亞特蘭大人喜愛這願景， 勝於他們車窗外看到的景色。 亞特蘭大人實現了這願景， 若非如此，我們無法建得起來。 從一開始就是多樣化的的合作，"}, {"zh-tw": " People of all stripeswere part of our story. People on the lower endof the economic spectrum loved it, too.", "en": " 來自不同領域的人是我們的成員。 經濟上的弱勢者也喜愛這計畫。"}, {"zh-tw": " They were just afraidthey weren't going to be able to be there when it got built,that they'd be priced out. And we've all heardthat kind of story before, right? But we promised thatthe Atlanta BeltLine would be different, and people took ownership of the idea, and they made it betterthan anything we ever imagined in the beginning, including significantsubsidies for housing, new parks, art, an arboretum --a list that continues to grow.", "en": " 他們只怕建好的時候太貴了，他們負擔不起。 我們都聽說過那樣的事，對吧？ 但是我們承諾亞特蘭大環線將會不同。 人們以貢獻想法為己任， 使它遠超出我們最初的想像， 包括顯著的住房補貼、 新公園、藝術建築、植物園 --表單持續地增長。"}, {"zh-tw": " And we put in place the organizations and agenciesthat were required to make it happen. And importantly, it is.", "en": " 我們設立了為實現這些的必要組織和機構。 重要的是，必須要實現。"}, {"zh-tw": " Now we're in the early stagesof implementation, and it's working. The first mainline sectionof trail was opened in 2012, and it's already generatedover three billion dollars of private-sector investment.", "en": " 我們目前正處於早期建造的階段，進展相當不錯。 第一段主線道於 2012 年啟用， 來自私營部門的投資已達三十多億美元。"}, {"zh-tw": " But it's not only changingthe physical form of the city, it's changing the waywe think about the city, and what our expectations arefor living there. About a month ago, I had to take my kids with meto the grocery store and they were complaining about it, because they didn't wantto get in the car.", "en": " 不僅改變了城市的外貌， 也改變了我們對城市的看法， 以及對於居住環境的期待。 大約一個月前， 我要帶孩子上超市， 他們很不情願， 因為不想坐車。"}, {"zh-tw": " They were saying, \"Dad, if we have to go, can we at least ride our bikes?\" And I said, \"Of course we can. That's what people in Atlanta do.", "en": " 他們問：「爸爸，若我們必須跟著， 讓我們騎自行車去好嗎？」 我回答：「當然好啊。"}, {"zh-tw": " We ride our bikes to the grocery store.\" Thank you, yeah. Now, they don't knowhow ridiculous that is, but I do.", "en": " 我們亞特蘭大人就是騎自行車上超市的。」 好耶。謝謝。 他們不知道那有多荒謬， 而我知道。"}, {"zh-tw": " And I also understandthat their expectations for Atlanta are really powerful. This kind of transformationis exactly like sprawl in the last century, the movement where our investmentin highways and automobiles fundamentally changed American life.", "en": " 並且我明白，他們對亞特蘭大的期許是多麼的強而有力。 這樣的轉變與上個世紀的城市擴張相似， 當時人們投資於公路和汽車， 徹底的改變了美國人的生活。"}, {"zh-tw": " That wasn't some grand conspiracy. There were conspiracieswithin it, of course.", "en": " 那並非什麼大陰謀。 當然，裡頭是有些陰謀。"}, {"zh-tw": " But it was a cultural momentum. It was millions of peoplemaking millions of decisions over an extended period of time, that fundamentally changednot only the way that we build cities, but it changed our expectations for our lives.", "en": " 但那是文化的動能。 當時在相當長的一段時間裡，數百萬人做出數百萬個決定， 不僅徹底改變了我們造鎮的方式， 也改變了我們對於生活的期待。"}, {"zh-tw": " These changes were the foundationsfor urban sprawl. We didn't call it sprawl at that time.", "en": " 這樣的改變是城市擴張的基礎。 在當時未被稱為城市擴張，"}, {"zh-tw": " We called it the future. And it was.", "en": " 而稱之為「未來」。 的確是未來。"}, {"zh-tw": " And we got all the highwaysand strip malls and cul-de-sacs we wanted. It was a radical transformation, but it was built by a cultural momentum.", "en": " 我們得到高速公路、大型購物商場和死路。 那是翻天覆地的變化， 來自於文化的動能。"}, {"zh-tw": " So it's important to not separate the physical constructionof the places we live from other things thatare happening at that time. At that time, in the second half of the last century, science was curing disease and lifting us to the moon, and the sexual revolutionwas breaking down barriers, and the Civil Rights Movementbegan its march toward the fulfillmentof our nation's promise.", "en": " 因此，不去區隔 我們居住地的硬體建築與其他當時發生的事物 極其重要。 當時 在二十世紀的後半， 科學治癒了疾病， 把人類送上月球， 性別革命突破了原本的障礙， 民權運動也正開始 向實現國家承諾的方向邁進。"}, {"zh-tw": " Television, entertainment, food, travel,business -- everything was changing, and both the publicand private sectors were colluding to give us the lives we wanted. The Federal Highway Administration, for example, didn't existbefore there were highways.", "en": " 電視、娛樂、食物、旅遊和商務全都在變化著， 公、私部門串通 給予我們所嚮往的生活。 例如，美國聯邦公路總署在高速公路出現前並不存在。"}, {"zh-tw": " Think about it. Of course, today it's importantto understand and acknowledge that those benefits accruedto some groups of people and not to others.", "en": " 值得深思啊。 當然，重要的是今天我們應當理解並認知到 有些人獲益， 而其他人則否。"}, {"zh-tw": " It was not an equitable cultural momentum. But when we look todayin wonder and disgust, maybe, at the metropolis sprawl before us, we wonder if we're stuck.", "en": " 那個文化動能並不平等。 或許我們今天對眼前的城市擴張投以驚訝和厭惡的目光， 納悶是否已萬劫不復。"}, {"zh-tw": " Are we stuck with the legacyof that inequity? Are we stuck with this dystopiantraffic hellscape? Are we stuck with rampanturban displacement, with environmental degradation? Are we stuck with social isolation or political polarization? Are these the inevitableand permanent outcomes? Or are they the resultof our collective cultural decisions that we've made for ourselves? And if they are, can't we change them? What I have learnedfrom our experience in Atlanta is not an anomaly. Similar storiesare playing out everywhere, where people are reclaimingnot only old railroads, but also degraded urban waterwaysand obsolete roadways, reinventing all of the infrastructure in their lives.", "en": " 我們是否已深陷不平等的遺害中？ 是否陷入非樂園的交通地獄中？ 是否嵌在蔓生和移位的城市， 以及傾頹的環境中呢？ 是否陷入了社會孤立， 或兩極化的政治裡呢？ 這些是無可避免的永恆結局嗎？ 或者，這些是我們自決自造的的共業呢？ 果真如此， 我們能改變現狀嗎？ 我在亞特蘭大學到的經驗 並非特例。 各地有著相似的故事， 人們不僅重新活化舊鐵道、 惡化的城市下水道、廢棄的公路， 重塑他們生活中的種種基礎設施。"}, {"zh-tw": " Whether here in New York or in Houston or Miami, Detroit, Philadelphia, Seoul, Hong Kong, Singapore, Toronto and Paris, cities big and small all over the worldare reclaiming and reinventing this infrastructure for themselves, including the motherof all catalyst infrastructure projects, the Los Angeles River, the revitalization effortfor which similarly started as a grassroots movement, has developed into a cultural momentum, and is now in the early stagesof being transformed into some kind of life-affirminginfrastructure again, this one with trails and parksand fishing and boating and community revitalization, and of course, water qualityand flood control. It's already improvingthe lives of people.", "en": " 無論是在紐約這裡 或是休斯頓、 邁阿密、 底特律、費城、 首爾、香港、新加坡、 多倫多和巴黎。 世界各地大大小小的城市都在為自己糾正並重新設計 他們的基礎設施； 其中包括了基礎設施的原始建設範例 -- 洛杉磯河。 類似的振興努力 始於草根運動， 現已發展為文化動能， 目前正處於轉型為某種樹立生活基礎設施的早期階段。 洛杉磯河這個有著小徑、公園、垂釣、划船、 社區振興， 當然還包括了改善水質和防洪。 它已提高人們的生活水平。"}, {"zh-tw": " It's already changing the waythe rest of us think about Los Angeles. This is more than just infrastructure.", "en": " 也改變了我們這些外人對洛杉磯的認知。 這些遠遠超出了基礎的設施。"}, {"zh-tw": " We're building new lives for ourselves. It's a movement that includeslocal food, urban agriculture, craft beer, the maker movement, tech and design -- all of these things,early indicators of a really radical shift in the way we build cities.", "en": " 我們正在為自身建立新的生活。 這振興運動包括了本地食品、城市農業、 啤酒工藝、製造商動態、 科技與設計等等， 全都指示著我們正在徹底改變建設城市的方式。"}, {"zh-tw": " We're taking places like this and transforming them into this. And soon this.", "en": " 我們正把這樣的地方 轉變為這樣， 不久後將成為這樣。"}, {"zh-tw": " And this is all exciting and good. We're changing the world for the better.", "en": " 這令人興奮，很不錯。 我們正把世界變好。"}, {"zh-tw": " Good for us! And it is awesome -- I mean that. But our history of sprawl, and from what we can already seewith these catalyst projects today, we know and must remember that big changes like thisdon't usually benefit everyone.", "en": " 恭喜我們做得好！ 我衷心認為太棒了。 但是我們擴張城市的歷史， 以及今日我們從這類觸媒計畫中學到的， 心知肚明我們必須記得， 這樣的劇變並非人人得益。"}, {"zh-tw": " The market forces unleashedby this cultural momentum often include the seemingly unstoppable and inevitable cycle of rising taxes,prices and rents. This is urgent.", "en": " 文化動能釋出的市場力道 通常包括看來擋不住、 避免不了稅金、物價和租金的上揚。 這很緊迫。"}, {"zh-tw": " If we care, we have to stand up and speak out. This should be a call to action, because the answer can't beto not improve communities.", "en": " 如果在乎，就必須挺身而出， 大聲疾呼。 應該號召行動， 因為不改善社區並非選項。"}, {"zh-tw": " The answer can't be to not build parksand transit and grocery stores. The answer can't beto hold communities down just to keep them affordable.", "en": " 不建造公園、運輸系統和雜貨店並不是解決之道。 不能讓社區繼續沒落下去， 只為了使它仍然平價、負擔得起。"}, {"zh-tw": " But we do have to follow throughand address the financial realities that we're facing. This is hard, and it won'thappen on its own.", "en": " 但我們接下來必須面對並解決現實的財務問題。 很難，它不會自行轉好。"}, {"zh-tw": " We can do it, and I'm committedto this goal in Atlanta, to sticking up again for peoplewho made it possible in the first place. We can't call it a success without them.", "en": " 我們做得到。 我承諾要在亞特蘭大做到， 為支持此計畫的人們挺身而出。 沒有他們，就稱不上成功。"}, {"zh-tw": " I certainly can't, because the people I madecommitments to all those years weren't abstract populations.
