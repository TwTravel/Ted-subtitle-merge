For example, during the Great Depression, they created the Hoover Dam, which in turn, created Lake Mead and made it possible for the citiesof Las Vegas and Phoenix and Los Angeles to provide water for people who livedin a really dry place.", "en": " 我們的祖父輩創造了一套 非常棒的渠道及水庫系統， 讓大家能住在水不多的地方。 譬如在美國大蕭條時期， 他們建造出胡佛水壩， 也因而造出人工湖米德湖， 能為拉斯維加斯、鳳凰城 及洛杉磯供水， 讓大家能住在很乾燥的地方。"}, {"zh-tw": " In the 20th century,we literally spent trillions of dollars building infrastructureto get water to our cities. In terms of economic development,it was a great investment.", "en": " 20 世紀時，我們確實花了幾兆美元 做基礎建設送水到城市。 以經濟發展而言，這是一項偉大的投資。"}, {"zh-tw": " But in the last decade,we've seen the combined effects of climate change, population growthand competition for water resources threaten these vital lifelinesand water resources. This figure shows you the changein the lake level of Lake Mead that happened in the last 15 years.", "en": " 但是在過去十年，我們看到氣候變遷 與人口成長的綜合影響，而對水資源的競爭 威脅到這些重要的命脈及水資源。 這張表顯示米德湖水位 在過去十五年的變化。"}, {"zh-tw": " You can see starting around the year 2000, the lake level started to drop. And it was dropping at such a rate that it would have left the drinking waterintakes for Las Vegas high and dry.", "en": " 大家可以看到大約從 2000 年開始， 水位開始下降。 下降幅度之快， 讓拉斯維加斯飲用水取水口遠高過湖水位並乾涸。"}, {"zh-tw": " The city became so concerned about this that they recently constructeda new drinking water intake structure that they referred to as the \"Third Straw\" to pull water outof the greater depths of the lake. The challenges associatedwith providing water to a modern city are not restrictedto the American Southwest.", "en": " 該市非常擔心， 因此他們最近新建了一個飲用水取水口， 他們稱之為「第三根吸管」， 從愈來愈低的湖中取水。 供水給現代都市所面臨的挑戰 並非只限於美南地區。"}, {"zh-tw": " In the year 2007, the third largestcity in Australia, Brisbane, came within 6 monthsof running out of water. A similar drama is playing out todayin São Paulo, Brazil, where the main reservoir for the city has gone from beingcompletely full in 2010, to being nearly empty today as the city approachesthe 2016 Summer Olympics.", "en": " 2007 年，澳洲第三大都市布里斯本 缺水缺了六個月。 今天類似的情景也在巴西聖保羅上演， 該市的主要水庫 從 2010 年滿水位狀況， 到今天幾乎完全乾涸， 而該市正準備舉行2016 年夏季奧運會。"}, {"zh-tw": " For those of us who are fortunate enough to live in oneof the world's great cities, we've never truly experiencedthe effects of a catastrophic drought. We like to complainabout the navy showers we have to take.", "en": " 對我們這些有幸住在世界 各個重大都市的人而言， 我們從未真正體驗過毀滅性的旱災。 我們抱怨要洗戰鬥澡。"}, {"zh-tw": " We like our neighbors to seeour dirty cars and our brown lawns. But we've never really facedthe prospect of turning on the tap and having nothing come out.", "en": " 我們喜歡讓鄰居看見我們的髒車及枯黃的草皮。 但是我們從未真正面對過 打開水龍頭卻無水可用的窘境。"}, {"zh-tw": " And that's because when thingshave gotten bad in the past, it's always been possibleto expand a reservoir or dig a few more groundwater wells. Well, in a time when allof the water resources are spoken for, it's not going to be possibleto rely on this tried and true way of providing ourselves with water.", "en": " 這是因為過去情況變糟時， 我們總是有辦法擴建水庫， 或挖更多口地下水井。 在所有水資源都已開發殆盡的年代， 我們不可能再依賴這種已知可行的方法 來提供用水。"}, {"zh-tw": " Some people think that we're goingto solve the urban water problem by taking water from our rural neighbors.

The first source of local watersupply that we need to develop to solve our urban water problem will flow with the rainwaterthat falls in our cities.", "en": " 但是依我自己的經驗， 在過去幾十年與世界上幾個非常缺水的都市合作後， 讓我知道我們的確有科技與管理技巧 能真的轉變到不用從外面引水， 這也是我今晚的主題。 我們第一個要打開的當地供水資源 以解決我們的都市水問題， 會流出降在都市內的雨水。"}, {"zh-tw": " One of the great tragediesof urban development is that as our cities grew, we started covering all the surfaceswith concrete and asphalt. And when we did that,we had to build storm sewers to get the waterthat fell on the cities out before it could cause flooding, and that's a wasteof a vital water resource.", "en": " 都市發展的大悲劇之一， 就是隨著都市成長， 我們以混凝土及瀝青覆蓋所有的表面。 在我們如此做的同時，又必須蓋雨水下水道 將降下的雨水排到都市外， 不然會引起水災， 這浪費了我們重要的水資源。"}, {"zh-tw": " Let me give you an example. This figure here shows youthe volume of water that could be collectedin the city of San Jose if they could harvest the stormwaterthat fell within the city limits.", "en": " 舉一個例子， 這張表顯示 在矽谷聖荷西市能收集的雨水水量， 只要他們能把市區範圍內的雨水全都收集起來。"}, {"zh-tw": " You can see from the intersectionof the blue line and the black dotted line that if San Jose could just capture halfof the water that fell within the city, they'd have enough waterto get them through an entire year. Now, I know what some of youare probably thinking.", "en": " 從藍線與黑點線的交點可以看到 聖荷西只要能收集降在市區範圍內一半的雨水， 就有足夠的水撐過一整年。 我知道有些人可能會這麼想："}, {"zh-tw": " \"The answer to our problemis to start building great big tanks and attaching themto the downspouts of our roof gutters, rainwater harvesting.\" Now, that's an ideathat might work in some places. But if you live in a placewhere it mainly rains in the winter time and most of the water demandis in the summertime, it's not a very cost-effective wayto solve a water problem.", "en": " 「那我們的解決方案就是開始裝幾個大桶子， 與簷槽的雨落水管相連， 收集雨水。」 這個想法在某些地方或許可行。 但是如果你住的地方雨季主要在冬天， 最需要水的時候卻是夏天， 這就不是非常具經濟效益的解決方法。"}, {"zh-tw": " And if you experience the effectsof a multiyear drought, like California's currently experiencing, you just can't build a rainwater tankthat's big enough to solve your problem. I think there's a lot more practical way to harvest the stormwater andthe rainwater that falls in our cities, and that's to capture itand let it percolate into the ground.", "en": " 如果你經歷多年旱災的影響， 像加州現在一樣， 你不可能蓋一個夠大的雨水儲槽來解決問題。 我想有很多更實際的方式 能收集降在市區範圍內的雨水， 那就是要留住雨水並滲透到地下。"}, {"zh-tw": " After all, many of our cities are sittingon top of a natural water storage system that can accommodatehuge volumes of water. For example, historically,Los Angeles has obtained about a third of its water supplyfrom a massive aquifer that underlies the San Fernando Valley.", "en": " 畢竟，許多城市都位於天然儲水系統上方， 能容納大量的水。 舉例而言，歷史上洛杉磯曾經 從聖費爾南多谷下方的蓄水層取得約三分之一的供水。"}, {"zh-tw": " Now, when you look at the waterthat comes off of your roof and runs off of your lawnand flows down the gutter, you might say to yourself,\"Do I really want to drink that stuff?\" Well, the answer isyou don't want to drink it until it's been treated a little bit. And so the challenge that we facein urban water harvesting is to capture the water, clean the water and get it underground.", "en": " 現在，當你看著屋頂上的水 流過你的草坪，從屋簷流下， 你大概會對自己說：「那種水真的能喝嗎？」 答案是你不想喝那種水， 除非這水經過一些處理。 所以我們收集都市雨水要面對的挑戰， 就是要把水留住、弄乾淨 並存入地下。"}, {"zh-tw": " And that's exactlywhat the city of Los Angeles is doing with a new project that they're buildingin Burbank, California. This figure here showsthe stormwater park that they're building by hooking a series of stormwatercollection systems, or storm sewers, and routing that waterinto an abandoned gravel quarry.", "en": " 這正是洛杉磯市目前正在執行的， 他們在柏本克市興建一項新計畫。 這張圖是他們正在興建的雨水處理廠， 他們將一系列的雨水收集系統即雨水下水道連接起來， 將收集的水導入一座廢棄的採石場。"}, {"zh-tw": " The water that's captured in the quarry is slowly passedthrough a man-made wetland, and then it goesinto that ball field there and percolates into the ground, recharging the drinking wateraquifer of the city. And in the processof passing through the wetland and percolating through the ground, the water encounters microbesthat live on the surfaces of the plants and the surfaces of the soil, and that purifies the water.", "en": " 在此採石場收集到的水， 會慢慢流經一座人造溼地， 然後進入那塊沙洲， 再滲入地面， 補注該市的飲用水蓄水層。 在通過溼地 及滲入地下的過程中， 水會碰到存在於植物表面 及土表的微生物， 這會淨化水。"}, {"zh-tw": " And if the water'sstill not clean enough to drink after it's been throughthis natural treatment process, the city can treat it again when they pump if back outof the groundwater aquifers before they deliver it to people to drink. The second tap that we need to open upto solve our urban water problem will flow with the wastewater that comes outof our sewage treatment plants.", "en": " 如果這些水仍然不夠乾淨到能喝的程度， 在這項天然的處理過程之後， 該市會再處理一次， 他們從地下水層抽水出來， 處裡後再供水給大家喝。 我們要解決都市水問題該開的第二個水龍頭 會流出廢水， 從我們的汙水處理廠出來。"}, {"zh-tw": " Now, many of you are probably familiarwith the concept of recycled water. You've probably seen signs like this that tell you that the shrubberyand the highway median and the local golf course is being watered with water that used to bein a sewage treatment plant.", "en": " 在座很多人大概還滿熟悉再生水（中水）的概念。 你大概看過像這樣的標誌， 顯示這塊灌木叢、高速公路的中央安全島、 還有家附近的高爾夫球場 都用再生水灌溉， 從汙水處理廠裡流出來。"}, {"zh-tw": " We've been doing thisfor a couple of decades now. But what we're learningfrom our experience is that this approach is much moreexpensive that we expected it to be.", "en": " 這早已行之有年。 但是我們從經驗得知 這個方式遠比我們預期的貴很多。"}, {"zh-tw": " Because once we buildthe first few water recycling systems close to the sewage treatment plant, we have to build longerand longer pipe networks to get that water to where it needs to go. And that becomes prohibitivein terms of cost.", "en": " 因為一旦我們蓋了頭幾座再生水系統廠， 位於汙水處理廠附近， 我們就必須接愈來愈長的管線 把水輸送到該去的地方。 這會讓人卻步，因為成本過高。"}, {"zh-tw": " What we're finding is that a much more cost-effectiveand practical way of recycling wastewater is to turn treated wastewaterinto drinking water through a two-step process. In the first step in this processwe pressurize the water and pass it througha reverse osmosis membrane: a thin, permeable plastic membrane that allows water moleculesto pass through but traps and retains the salts,the viruses and the organic chemicals that might be present in the wastewater.", "en": " 我們發現 更具經濟效益及更實際的再生廢水方法， 是把處理過的廢水變成飲水， 這要透過二個處理步驟。 第一步是將水加壓 讓它通過逆滲透膜： 那是一層可滲透的塑膠薄膜， 讓水分子通過， 但是會抓住及留住鹽分、病毒及有機化學物質， 這些東西可能存在於廢水中。"}, {"zh-tw": " In the second step in the process, we add a small amount of hydrogen peroxide and shine ultraviolet light on the water. The ultraviolet lightcleaves the hydrogen peroxide into two parts that are calledhydroxyl radicals, and these hydroxyl radicalsare very potent forms of oxygen that break down most organic chemicals.", "en": " 處理過程的第二步 是注入少量的過氧化氫 及照射紫外線。 紫外線會分解過氧化氫 成為兩個氫氧自由基， 氫氧自由基是非常有力的氧形式， 會分解大部分的有機化學物質。"}, {"zh-tw": " After the water's beenthrough this two-stage process, it's safe to drink. I know, I've been studying recycled water using every measurement techniqueknown to modern science for the past 15 years.", "en": " 水經過這兩個步驟處理後， 可以安全飲用。 我知道， 我利用所有現代科學已知的測量技術 研究再生水 研究了 15 年。"}, {"zh-tw": " We've detected some chemicals that can make it throughthe first step in the process, but by the time we get to the second step, the advanced oxidation process, we rarely see any chemicals present. And that's in stark contrastto the taken-for-granted water supplies that we regularly drink all the time.", "en": " 我們偵測到某些化學物品 可以通過此處理過程的第一步， 但是到了第二步， 即高級氧化程序， 我們很難再看到任何化學物品。 這與我們天天飲用、視為理所當然的自來水 形成鮮明對比。"}, {"zh-tw": " There's another way we can recycle water. This is an engineered treatment wetlandthat we recently built on the Santa Ana Riverin Southern California.", "en": " 還有一種方法可以再生水。 這是我們剛興建的人工溼地， 位於南加州聖塔安娜河。"}, {"zh-tw": " The treatment wetland receives waterfrom a part of the Santa Ana River that in the summertime consistsalmost entirely of wastewater effluent from cities like Riversideand San Bernardino. The water comesinto our treatment wetland, it's exposed to sunlight and algae and those break downthe organic chemicals, remove the nutrientsand inactivate the waterborne pathogens.", "en": " 這座人工溼地接收從聖塔安娜河部分河段進來的水， 夏天時幾乎全是廢汙水， 由河濱市及聖伯那地諾市等地排放。 廢汙水進入我們的處理溼地， 曝露於陽光及藻類下， 這個過程會分解有機化學物， 去除營養物並使水媒病原體失去活性。"}, {"zh-tw": " The water gets put backin the Santa Ana River, it flows down to Anaheim, gets taken out at Anaheimand percolated into the ground, and becomes the drinking waterof the city of Anaheim, completing the tripfrom the sewers of Riverside County to the drinking water supplyof Orange County. Now, you might thinkthat this idea of drinking wastewater is some sort of futuristic fantasyor not commonly done.", "en": " 該水再流放回聖塔安納河， 往下流到安納罕， 然後在安納罕滲透入地面， 並成為安納罕市的飲水， 是一趟從河濱縣的廢汙水 轉變成橘縣飲用水的完美旅程。 你可能會認為這種喝廢水的想法 是某種未來的幻想或不常見。"}, {"zh-tw": " Well, in California, we already recycleabout 40 billion gallons a year of wastewater through the two-stageadvanced treatment process I was telling you about. That's enough water to bethe supply of about a million people if it were their sole water supply.", "en": " 但是在加州，我們每年已再生一千五百多億公升廢水， 都由這種我剛剛提到的二階段式的高級氧化處理過程再生， 這個量足夠提供大約一百萬人使用， 如果這是他們唯一的水源。"}, {"zh-tw": " The third tap that we need to open upwill not be a tap at all, it will be a kind of virtual tap, it will be the water conservationthat we manage to do. And the place where we need to thinkabout water conservation is outdoors because in Californiaand other modern American cities, about half of our water usehappens outdoors.", "en": " 我們必須打開的第三個水龍頭跟水龍頭一點關係都沒有， 它是虛擬的水龍頭， 它就是我們能做到的節約用水。 我們要思索如何節約的地方是戶外， 因為在加州及美國其它現代都市， 我們的水有一半用在戶外。"}, {"zh-tw": " In the current drought, we've seen that it's possible to have our lawns surviveand our plants survive with about half as much water. So there's no needto start painting concrete green and putting in Astroturfand buying cactuses.", "en": " 目前的乾旱 讓我們看見 要讓草皮及植物生存， 只要以往一半的水就夠了， 所以實在不需要把門前車道噴成綠色、 鋪上人工草皮及買仙人掌。"}, {"zh-tw": " We can have California-friendlylandscaping with soil moisture detectors and smart irrigation controllers and have beautifulgreen landscapes in our cities. The fourth and final water tapthat we need to open up to solve our urban water problem will flow with desalinated seawater.", "en": " 我們可以用適合加州的園藝造景，裝上土壤水分偵測器 及智慧型澆水控制器， 就能在城市裡有美麗的綠色園景。 我們要開的第四個也是最後一個水龍頭 以解決都市水問題， 會流出海水淡化水。"}, {"zh-tw": " Now, I know what you probably heardpeople say about seawater desalination. \"It's a great thing to do if you havelots of oil, not a lot of water and you don't care about climate change.\" Seawater desalination is energy-intensiveno matter how you slice it.", "en": " 我知道你們大概聽過別人這樣說海水淡化： 「如果你有大量石油，卻沒有大量的水， 而且你也不在乎氣候變遷，那這是件好事。」 無論你怎麼看，海水淡化都非常耗能。"}, {"zh-tw": " But that characterizationof seawater desalination as being a nonstarteris hopelessly out of date. We've made tremendous progressin seawater desalination in the past two decades.", "en": " 但是把海水淡化視為 毫無前途是無可救藥的過時想法。 海水淡化在過去二十年已有長足進步。"}, {"zh-tw": " This picture shows you the largest seawater desalination plantin the Western hemisphere that's currently being builtnorth of San Diego. Compared to the seawaterdesalination plant that was built inSanta Barbara 25 years ago, this treatment plantwill use about half the energy to produce a gallon of water.", "en": " 這張照片上面 是西半球最大的海水淡化廠， 目前正在聖地牙哥北邊興建。 與另一座海水淡化廠相比， 25 年前建於聖塔芭芭拉， 這座處理廠生產一加侖的水 只要用約一半的能量。"}, {"zh-tw": " But just because seawater desalinationhas become less energy-intensive, doesn't mean we should start buildingdesalination plants everywhere. Among the different choices we have, it's probably the most energy-intensive and potentially environmentally damaging of the options to createa local water supply.", "en": " 但是就算海水淡化現在比較不那麼耗能， 也不代表我們就該在四處開始興建處理廠。 在我們各種選項中， 這大概是最耗能源、 最破壞環境的一種方法 來創造當地水資源。"}, {"zh-tw": " So there it is. With these four sources of water, we can move awayfrom our reliance on imported water.", "en": " 情況就是這樣。 開了這四個水龍頭， 我們就不需仰賴外地引水。"}, {"zh-tw": " Through reform in the way we landscapeour surfaces and our properties, we can reduce outdoor water useby about 50 percent, thereby increasing the water supply by 25 percent. We can recycle the waterthat makes it into the sewer, thereby increasingour water supply by 40 percent.", "en": " 透過改良我們園藝造景的方法， 我們可以節省約 50% 的戶外用水， 因而增加 25% 的供水。 我們可以再生廢汙水， 因而增加 40% 供水。"}, {"zh-tw": " And we can make up the differencethrough a combination of stormwater harvestingand seawater desalination. So, let's create a water supply that will be ableto withstand any of the challenges that climate change throws at usin the coming years.", "en": " 我們也可以透過結合 收集雨水及海水淡化補足供水量。 所以，讓我們創造一套 能夠承受任何挑戰的供水法， 在未來幾年能因應氣候變遷帶來的挑戰。"}, {"zh-tw": " Let's create a water supplythat uses local sources and leaves more waterin the environment for fish and for food. Let's create a water system that'sconsistent with out environmental values.", "en": " 讓我們創造一套使用當地水資源 並能在環境中留更多水給魚類、給糧食用的方法。 讓我們創造一套能與環境價值相符合的供水系統。"}, {"zh-tw": " And let's do it for our childrenand our grandchildren and let's tell them this is the system that they have totake care of in the future because it's our last chanceto create a new kind of water system. Thank you very much for your attention.", "en": " 讓我們為子孫做這件事， 並告訴他們 未來他們要好好照顧這套系統， 因為這是我們創造新式供水系統的最後機會。 謝謝大家專心聆聽。"}], "title": "David Sedlak 4 Ways We Can Avoid A Catastrophic Drought"}
