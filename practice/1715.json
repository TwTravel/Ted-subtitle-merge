Still, Abed was far from my mind, when last year, I returned to Israel to write of the crash, and the book I then wrote, \"Half-Life,\" was nearly complete when I recognized that I still wanted to meet Abed, and finally I understood why: to hear this man say two words: \"I'm sorry.\" People apologize for less.", "en": " 畢竟我已經歷我的命運 儘管我逐漸淡忘Abed，直到去年 為了撰寫關於這場車禍的經歷，我重返以色列 當這本著作《Half-Life》 即將完成時，我意識到 我仍然想和Abed見面 我終於明白其中原因： 我想聽這個人說兩個字：抱歉 人們會為更微不足道的事道歉"}, {"zh-tw": " And so I got a cop to confirm that Abed still lived somewhere in his same town, and I was now driving to it with a potted yellow rose in the back seat, when suddenly flowers seemed a ridiculous offering.

Better.", "en": " 因此我向一名警察確認，Abed仍住在 原本那個小鎮某處 這次我開車前往，後座放了一盆黃玫瑰 此時我突然覺得鮮花似乎是一份荒謬至極的禮物 但你還能帶什麼給弄斷你該死的脖子的人？ 我駛進Abu Ghosh鎮 買了一塊土耳其軟糖 帶著玫瑰花香的開心果口味。這好多了"}, {"zh-tw": " Back on Highway 1, I envisioned what awaited.

Abed would spit at me.", "en": " 我駛回1號高速公路想像等待我的會是什麼 Abed或許會擁抱我Abed或許會朝我吐口水"}, {"zh-tw": " Abed would say, \"I'm sorry.\" I then began to wonder, as I had many times before, how my life would have been different had this man not injured me, had my genes been fed a different helping of experience. Who was I? Was I who I had been before the crash, before this road divided my life like the spine of an open book? Was I what had been done to me? Were all of us the results of things done to us, done for us, the infidelity of a parent or spouse, money inherited? Were we instead our bodies, their inborn endowments and deficits? It seemed that we could be nothing more than genes and experience, but how to tease out the one from the other? As Yeats put that same universal question, \"O body swayed to music, o brightening glance, how can we know the dancer from the dance?\" I'd been driving for an hour when I looked in my rearview mirror and saw my own brightening glance.", "en": " Abed或許會說，「抱歉」 接著我開始想像如同曾經浮現過無數次的想法 我的人生將有何不同？ 如果這個人不曾使我受傷 如果我曾經擁有不同經歷 我會是什麼樣的人？ 我會是車禍之前那個我嗎？ 在那條道路彷彿攤開書本的書脊般將我的人生一分為二之前？ 我是否是過往經歷的產物？ 是否世上每個人都是過往經歷的產物？ 例如父母的離異或配偶的不忠 或繼承的財產？ 是否塑造我們的並非身體和與生俱來的天賦及缺陷？ 彷彿我們僅是遺傳和經驗的產物 但如何分辨其中差異？ 如葉慈曾經提出的概念問題 「喔，隨著音樂搖曳的身體喔，閃亮的眼神」 「我們如何區分舞者與舞蹈？」 我開了一小時的車 當我望向後照鏡時，看見自己閃亮的眼神"}, {"zh-tw": " The light my eyes had carried for as long as they had been blue. The predispositions and impulses that had propelled me as a toddler to try and slip over a boat into a Chicago lake, that had propelled me as a teen to jump into wild Cape Cod Bay after a hurricane.", "en": " 眼中的光芒從出生就已存在 天性和衝動驅使我 像個蹣跚學步的孩子般試圖從船上撲進芝加哥某個湖中 驅使我彷彿青少年般 在颶風後跳入波濤洶湧的鱈魚角"}, {"zh-tw": " But I also saw in my reflection that, had Abed not injured me, I would now, in all likelihood, be a doctor and a husband and a father. I would be less mindful of time and of death, and, oh, I would not be disabled, would not suffer the thousand slings and arrows of my fortune.", "en": " 但我也從鏡中倒影看見 如果Abed不曾使我受傷 現在我很可能成為一位醫生 一位丈夫、一位父親 我不會那麼在意時間和死亡 喔，我也不會殘廢 不會遭受無數坎坷的命運"}, {"zh-tw": " The frequent furl of five fingers, the chips in my teeth come from biting at all the many things a solitary hand cannot open. The dancer and the dance were hopelessly entwined.", "en": " 不時蜷起的五指、齒縫間的碎片 來自大部分我咬過的東西 一隻無法張開的手 舞者和舞蹈永遠無法合而為一"}, {"zh-tw": " It was approaching 11 when I exited right toward Afula, and passed a large quarry and was soon in Kfar Kara. I felt a pang of nerves.", "en": " 當我駛出通往Afula的交流道時，將近11點 經過一座大採石場後 很快就抵達Kfar Kara 我感到一陣緊張"}, {"zh-tw": " But Chopin was on the radio, seven beautiful mazurkas, and I pulled into a lot by a gas station to listen and to calm. I'd been told that in an Arab town, one need only mention the name of a local and it will be recognized.", "en": " 但收音機裡正播放蕭邦的樂曲七首美妙的馬祖卡舞曲 我駛入某個加油站旁的停車場 仔細聆聽，試著恢復平靜 我聽說在阿拉伯小鎮裡 只要提起當地人的名字 必定有人認識"}, {"zh-tw": " And I was mentioning Abed and myself, noting deliberately that I was here in peace, to the people in this town, when I met Mohamed outside a post office at noon. He listened to me.", "en": " 我說明Abed和我的關係 強調我來此並無惡意 對這座小鎮的居民 正午時分，我在郵局外遇見Mohamed 他聽我訴說來意"}, {"zh-tw": " You know, it was most often when speaking to people that I wondered where I ended and my disability began, for many people told me what they told no one else. Many cried.", "en": " 你們知道大多數情況下，當我向人們訴說 我想知道我之前的人生終止於何處我的殘疾從何而來 許多人會告訴我一些他們不曾告訴任何人的事 許多人潸然淚下"}, {"zh-tw": " And one day, after a woman I met on the street did the same and I later asked her why, she told me that, best she could tell, her tears had had something to do with my being happy and strong, but vulnerable too. I listened to her words. I suppose they were true.", "en": " 某天，我在街上遇到的一名女子表現出同樣反應後 我問她為何流淚 她告訴我，她認為 她是為了我的樂觀和堅強流淚 還有我的脆弱 聽了她的話之後，我認為確實如此"}, {"zh-tw": " I was me, but I was now me despite a limp, and that, I suppose, was what now made me, me. Anyway, Mohamed told me what perhaps he would not have told another stranger.", "en": " 我依然是我 但已成了現在的我，儘管身有殘疾 我想這正是使我成為現在的我的原因 總之，Mohamed告訴我 或許他不會告訴其他陌生人的事"}, {"zh-tw": " He led me to a house of cream stucco, then drove off. And as I sat contemplating what to say, a woman approached in a black shawl and black robe.", "en": " 他將帶我到一棟奶油色房子前，然後驅車離開 當我坐在車上，思考該說什麼時 一位穿著黑色披肩和黑色罩袍的女子走向我"}, {"zh-tw": " I stepped from my car and said \"Shalom,\" and identified myself, and she told me that her husband Abed would be home from work in four hours. Her Hebrew was not good, and she later confessed that she thought that I had come to install the Internet.", "en": " 我走下車，開口說「Shalom（平安，猶太招呼語）」 然後自我介紹 她說她丈夫Abed 將在4小時後下班回家 她的希伯來語不太好，之後她坦承 她以為我是來裝網路的"}, {"zh-tw": " I drove off and returned at 4:30, thankful to the minaret up the road that helped me find my way back. And as I approached the front door, Abed saw me, my jeans and flannel and cane, and I saw Abed, an average-looking man of average size.", "en": " 我驅車離開，於四點半返回 感謝路旁的尖塔 幫助我找到返回的路 當我走向前門時 Abed看見了我，我的牛仔褲、法蘭絨上衣和手杖 我也看見了Abed一名相貌普通、中等身材的男子"}, {"zh-tw": " He wore black and white: slippers over socks, pilling sweatpants, a piebald sweater, a striped ski cap pulled down to his forehead. He'd been expecting me. Mohamed had phoned.", "en": " 他穿著黑白色系服裝：拖鞋內穿著襪子 起毛球的運動褲、黑白相間的毛衣 蓋住前額的條紋滑雪帽 他知道我要來，Mohamed已打電話通知他"}, {"zh-tw": " And so at once, we shook hands, and smiled, and I gave him my gift, and he told me I was a guest in his home, and we sat beside one another on a fabric couch. It was then that Abed resumed at once the tale of woe he had begun over the phone 16 years before.", "en": " 因此我們立刻握手、微笑致意 我把禮物遞給他 他說我是他的貴賓 我們並肩坐在布質沙發上 Abed立刻開始繼續講述 他16年前於電話中未曾說完的悲慘故事 他16年前於電話中未曾說完的悲慘故事"}, {"zh-tw": " He'd just had surgery on his eyes, he said. He had problems with his side and his legs too, and, oh, he'd lost his teeth in the crash.", "en": " 他說他的眼睛剛動過手術 他的身側和大腿也有毛病 喔，他在那場車禍中失去了牙齒"}, {"zh-tw": " Did I wish to see him remove them? Abed then rose and turned on the TV so that I wouldn't be alone when he left the room, and returned with polaroids of the crash and his old driver's license. \"I was handsome,\" he said.", "en": " 我是否想看他拿下假牙？ 然後Abed站起身來，打開電視 希望他離開房間時我不會感到孤單 返回時，他拿著那場車禍的拍立得相片 和他的舊駕照 「我以前很帥，」他說"}, {"zh-tw": " We looked down at his laminated mug. Abed had been less handsome than substantial, with thick black hair and a full face and a wide neck.", "en": " 我們低頭看著那張佈滿摺痕的舊相片 Abed從來就稱不上帥 濃密的黑髮、飽滿的圓臉和粗壯的脖子"}, {"zh-tw": " It was this youth who on May 16, 1990, had broken two necks including mine, and bruised one brain and taken one life. Twenty-one years later, he was now thinner than his wife, his skin slack on his face, and looking at Abed looking at his young self, I remembered looking at that photograph of my young self after the crash, and recognized his longing.", "en": " 就是這個年輕人，在1990年5月16日 弄斷了兩個人的脖子，包括我在內 使一個人腦部受傷，奪去一條生命 21年後的今天，他比妻子還瘦 皮膚鬆垮地垂在臉上 看看眼前的Abed，再看看年輕時的他 我想起車禍後看見自己年輕時照片的感覺 明白了他的渴望"}, {"zh-tw": " \"The crash changed both of our lives,\" I said. Abed then showed me a picture of his mashed truck, and said that the crash was the fault of a bus driver in the left lane who did not let him pass.", "en": " 「那場車禍改變了我們兩人的生命，」我說 然後Abed讓我看他撞爛的卡車照片 說那場車禍是左車道那位公車司機的錯因為他不肯讓路 說那場車禍是左車道那位公車司機的錯因為他不肯讓路"}, {"zh-tw": " I did not want to recap the crash with Abed. I'd hoped for something simpler: to exchange a Turkish dessert for two words and be on my way.", "en": " 我不想和Abed重提那場車禍 我期待的是某些更簡單的事： 用土耳其軟糖換兩個字，然後走人"}, {"zh-tw": " And so I didn't point out that in his own testimony the morning after the crash, Abed did not even mention the bus driver. No, I was quiet. I was quiet because I had not come for truth.", "en": " 因此我並未指出車禍後那天上午他所說的證詞中 因此我並未指出車禍後那天上午他所說的證詞中 Abed甚至不曾提及那名公車司機 是的，我默不作聲因為我並非為了尋求真相而來"}, {"zh-tw": " I had come for remorse. And so I now went looking for remorse and threw truth under the bus.", "en": " 我是為了他的悔意而來 因此我繼續尋找這份悔意 讓真相埋葬在那輛公車下"}, {"zh-tw": " \"I understand,\" I said, \"that the crash was not your fault, but does it make you sad that others suffered?\" Abed spoke three quick words. \"Yes, I suffered.\" Abed then told me why he'd suffered.", "en": " 「我瞭解，」我說「那場車禍不是你的錯」 「但你是否為其他人的遭遇感到難過？」 Abed很快地說出幾個字 「是的，我很難過」 然後Abed告訴我為何他感到難過"}, {"zh-tw": " He'd lived an unholy life before the crash, and so God had ordained the crash, but now, he said, he was religious, and God was pleased. It was then that God intervened: news on the TV of a car wreck that hours before had killed three people up north.", "en": " 車禍前，他一直過著放蕩的生活 因此上帝降下這場車禍 但現在，他說他有了信仰，上帝感到喜悅 就在這時，上帝的身影浮現： 電視播出一則新聞：一場幾小時前發生的車禍 使三名前往北方的人喪命"}, {"zh-tw": " We looked up at the wreckage. \"Strange,\" I said.", "en": " 我們看著畫面上的汽車殘骸 「真巧，」我說"}, {"zh-tw": " \"Strange,\" he agreed. I had the thought that there, on Route 804, there were perpetrators and victims, dyads bound by a crash.", "en": " 「真巧，」Abed附和 我腦海裡浮現一個想法：在804公路上 有肇事者與受害者 因一場車禍產生聯繫"}, {"zh-tw": " Some, as had Abed, would forget the date.

Did it point up the degree to which he'd absolved himself of the crash? Was it evidence of guilt, an assertion that he should have been put away longer? He'd served six months in prison, lost his truck license for a decade.", "en": " Abed說了出人意料的話 難道是為了強調這場車禍錯不在他嗎？ 難道是內疚的表現 認為他應該多關幾年？ 他在監獄裡待了六個月卡車駕照被吊銷十年"}, {"zh-tw": " I forgot my discretion. \"Um, Abed,\" I said, \"I thought you had a few driving issues before the crash.\" \"Well,\" he said, \"I once went 60 in a 40.\" And so 27 violations -- driving through a red light, driving at excessive speed, driving on the wrong side of a barrier, and finally, riding his brakes down that hill -- reduced to one.", "en": " 我忘了原本的謹慎 「呃，Abed，」我說 「我想車禍前你已經有一些駕駛上的問題」 「喔，」他說「我曾經在速限40的情況下開到60」 因此，27次違規－ 闖紅燈、超速行駛 開上逆向車道 最後踩著剎車衝下山 濃縮成輕描淡寫的一句話"}, {"zh-tw": " And it was then I understood that no matter how stark the reality, the human being fits it into a narrative that is palatable. The goat becomes the hero. The perpetrator becomes the victim.", "en": " 此時，我領悟到，無論事實多麼明顯 人們總會將它美化成合理的故事 壞人成了英雄，犯罪者成了受害者"}, {"zh-tw": " It was then I understood that Abed would never apologize. Abed and I sat with our coffee.", "en": " 此時，我領悟到，Abed永遠不會道歉 Abed和我坐著喝咖啡"}, {"zh-tw": " We'd spent 90 minutes together, and he was now known to me. He was not a particularly bad man or a particularly good man.", "en": " 我們一起度過90分鐘 現在我已瞭解他的為人 他並非壞透頂的惡棍 亦非急公好義的大善人"}, {"zh-tw": " He was a limited man who'd found it within himself to be kind to me.

There was much I wished to say to Abed.", "en": " 但對我來說，很難與某個 如此徹底與自己造成的悲劇撇清關係的人套交情 這個渾渾噩噩過生活的人，他說 他以為有兩個人死於這場車禍 我有很多話想對Abed說"}, {"zh-tw": " I wished to tell him that, were he to acknowledge my disability, it would be okay, for people are wrong to marvel at those like me who smile as we limp. People don't know that they have lived through worse, that problems of the heart hit with a force greater than a runaway truck, that problems of the mind are greater still, more injurious, than a hundred broken necks.", "en": " 我想問他是否能體會我的殘疾 那沒什麼 人們總是對像我這樣面帶笑容的殘障人士做出錯誤解讀 人們總是對像我這樣面帶笑容的殘障人士做出錯誤解讀 人們不知道他們曾經歷過更悲慘的遭遇 內心的衝擊比一輛失控的卡車嚴重得多 心理問題甚至更加嚴重 更加傷人，勝於一百個斷了的脖子"}, {"zh-tw": " I wished to tell him that what makes most of us who we are most of all is not our minds and not our bodies and not what happens to us, but how we respond to what happens to us. \"This,\" wrote the psychiatrist Viktor Frankl, \"is the last of the human freedoms: to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances.\" I wished to tell him that not only paralyzers and paralyzees must evolve, reconcile to reality, but we all must -- the aging and the anxious and the divorced and the balding and the bankrupt and everyone.", "en": " 我想告訴他塑造我們大多數人的主要因素 我想告訴他塑造我們大多數人的主要因素 並非我們的思想、我們的身體 亦非我們的遭遇 而是如何面對我們的遭遇 精神病專家Viktor Frankl曾說 「這是人類最後的自主權：」 「在任何特定情況下選擇自己的態度」 我想告訴他，不僅是癱瘓者 和致人癱瘓者必須向前邁進，接受事實 每個人都必須如此－ 年老者、憂慮者、離婚者、禿頭者 破產者，乃至每個人"}, {"zh-tw": " I wished to tell him that one does not have to say that a bad thing is good, that a crash is from God and so a crash is good, a broken neck is good.

We have to be in the good and enjoy the good, study and work and adventure and friendship -- oh, friendship -- and community and love.", "en": " 最後，我想告訴他我們的使命十分明確： 我們必須從厄運中站起 我們必須處於好的狀態，並樂在其中 學習和工作、冒險和友誼－喔，友誼－ 夥伴，和愛"}, {"zh-tw": " But most of all, I wished to tell him what Herman Melville wrote, that \"truly to enjoy bodily warmth, some small part of you must be cold, for there is no quality in this world that is not what it is merely by contrast.\" Yes, contrast.
