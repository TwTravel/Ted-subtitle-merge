Why do we carry on with this approachthat doesn't seem to be working, and is there a better way out therethat we could try instead?

Looking at this, there was another professorcalled Peter Cohen in the Netherlands who said, maybe we shouldn'teven call it addiction.", "en": " 現在您若相信有關化學掛勾的事 您會覺得那根本是無稽之談但亞歷山大教授便開始去想 或許成癮有另外的解讀 他提到如果成癮跟化學掛勾也許無關呢? 而是跟你所處的環境有關呢? 或許上癮和嘗試適應你的環境有關？ 有了以上觀點 另一位來自荷蘭的教授彼得‧寇恩 他說也許我們根本不應該用\"成癮\"一詞"}, {"zh-tw": " Maybe we should call it bonding. Human beings have a naturaland innate need to bond, and when we're happy and healthy,we'll bond and connect with each other, but if you can't do that, because you're traumatized or isolatedor beaten down by life, you will bond with somethingthat will give you some sense of relief.", "en": " 或許我們應該稱之為\"連結\" 人類天生最原始的需求便是連結彼此 而當我們開心又健康時我們會去連結彼此的關係 但如果你無法這麼做的話 是因為你心裡有創傷或受孤立或是遭生活壓力擊敗所致 你需要跟某物做連結以幫助你舒緩壓力"}, {"zh-tw": " Now, that might be gambling,that might be pornography, that might be cocaine,that might be cannabis, but you will bond and connectwith something because that's our nature.
