And we said, wonderful! Look at this pretty structure.", "en": " 我們決定取一點乳腺細胞 我們決定取一點乳腺細胞 也就是\"腺胞\" 裡面有這些乳房內的微小物質 乳汁流經其中，嬰兒吸吮母乳時 會從末端流出 我們覺得太棒了! 瞧那美麗的結構"}, {"zh-tw": " We want to make this a structure, and ask the question, how do the cells do that? So, we took the red cells -- you see the red cells are surrounded by blue, other cells that squeeze them, and behind it is material that people thought was mainly inert, and it was just having a structure to keep the shape, and so we first photographed it with the electron microscope years and years ago, and you see this cell is actually quite pretty. It has a bottom, it has a top, it is secreting gobs and gobs of milk, because it just came from an early pregnant mouse.", "en": " 我們想以此做為架構，提出我們的問題 乳腺細胞究竟是如何辦到的呢? 所以我們取了紅色的細胞 他們被藍色細胞包圍著 其他細胞擠壓著他們， 更後面是一些無生命物質 它的結構是用來維持內部的形狀 多年前我們第一次用電子顯微鏡拍攝 多年前我們第一次用電子顯微鏡拍攝 你會發現這種細胞其實相當美麗 它有頂部和底部 不斷分泌大量的奶水 因為這是從一隻剛懷孕的老鼠身上取得的"}, {"zh-tw": " You take these cells, you put them in a dish, and within three days, they look like that. They completely forget.", "en": " 把這些細胞放入培養皿中 三天內他們便呈現這個樣貌 他們完全失去記憶"}, {"zh-tw": " So you take them out, you put them in a dish, they don't make milk. They completely forget.

The nuclei in the cell on the left is in the animal, the one on the right is in a dish. They are completely different from each other.", "en": " 看那細胞核，左邊細胞中的細胞核位於動物體內 右邊的則在培養皿中 兩者完全不一樣"}, {"zh-tw": " So, what does this tell you? This tells you that here also, context overrides. In different contexts, cells do different things.", "en": " 這告訴我們什麼呢? 從這裡也可得知，周遭的環境主宰一切 細胞在不同的環境中會做不同的事"}, {"zh-tw": " But how does context signal? So, Einstein said that \"For an idea that does not first seem insane, there is no hope.\" So, you can imagine the amount of skepticism I received -- couldn't get money, couldn't do a whole lot of other things, but I'm so glad it all worked out. So, we made a section of the mammary gland of the mouse, and all those lovely acini are there, every one of those with the red around them are an acinus, and we said okay, we are going to try and make this, and I said, maybe that red stuff around the acinus that people think there's just a structural scaffold, maybe it has information, maybe it tells the cells what to do, maybe it tells the nucleus what to do.", "en": " 但環境究竟給了細胞什麼指示呢? 愛因斯坦曾說過 \"一個想法起初若不瘋狂，那之後就沒什麼希望了\" 現在你能想像我受到的質疑有多少了吧? 我無法籌到經費 無法做許多事 但我很高興一切都解決了 我們製作了一個老鼠乳腺細胞的切片 這些美麗的腺胞都在這兒 每個被紅色物質包圍的都是一個腺胞 很好，現在我們要來試著證明 我就想，也許那些圍繞腺胞的紅色物質藏著訊息 只是人們認為那只是細胞的一部份結構 只是人們認為那只是細胞的一部份結構 或許那些物質告訴細胞和細胞核該做什麼"}, {"zh-tw": " So I said, extracellular matrix, which is this stuff called ECM, signals and actually tells the cells what to do. So, we decided to make things that would look like that.", "en": " 這些細胞外間質，也就是ECM 指示並告訴細胞該做什麼 所以呢，我們決定像圖上這樣做"}, {"zh-tw": " We found some gooey material that had the right extracellular matrix in it, we put the cells in it, and lo and behold, in about four days, they got reorganized and on the right, is what we can make in culture. On the left is what's inside the animal, we call it in vivo, and the one in culture was full of milk, the lovely red there is full of milk.", "en": " 我們找了一些含有所需的胞外間質的黏稠物質 我們找了一些含有所需的胞外間質的黏稠物質 將細胞放入其中，觀察了四天左右 發現他們重新排列 右邊的圖是我們能在培養皿中製造的 左邊則是動物體內，也就是活的有機體內的情形 培養中所培養的細胞生產了許多奶水 紅色的部分充滿奶水"}, {"zh-tw": " So, we Got Milk, for the American audience. All right. And here is this beautiful human cell, and you can imagine that here also, context goes.", "en": " 這裡的美國觀眾有奶喝了 很好，現在這是一個美麗的人類細胞 現在大家可以想像，細胞的周遭物質同樣主導一切"}, {"zh-tw": " So, what do we do now? I made a radical hypothesis. I said, if it's true that architecture is dominant, architecture restored to a cancer cell should make the cancer cell think it's normal.", "en": " 接著我們要做什麼呢? 我做了一個極端的假設 如下: 若細胞周圍的物質主宰著細胞的工作 修復癌細胞的胞外物質 會讓癌細胞誤以為正常的繼續運作"}, {"zh-tw": " Could this be done? So, we tried it. In order to do that, however, we needed to have a method of distinguishing normal from malignant, and on the left is the single normal cell, human breast, put in three-dimensional gooey gel that has extracellular matrix, it makes all these beautiful structures.", "en": " 這有可能發生嗎? 為此我們做了實驗 為了達成我們的目的 我們需要有個區別好壞細胞的方法 左邊是一個正常的細胞 一個放在含有3D黏稠膠質中的人乳細胞 黏液中含有胞外間質，這些美麗的結構都是來自於此"}, {"zh-tw": " On the right, you see it looks very ugly, the cells continue to grow, the normal ones stop. And you see here in higher magnification the normal acinus and the ugly tumor.", "en": " 右邊的卻非常醜陋 這些細胞不斷增長 正常的那邊卻停止了 把圖放的更大來看 兩邊分別是正常的腺胞和醜陋的腫瘤"}, {"zh-tw": " So we said, what is on the surface of these ugly tumors? Could we calm them down -- they were signaling like crazy and they have pathways all messed up -- and make them to the level of the normal? Well, it was wonderful. Boggles my mind. This is what we got.", "en": " 我們很好奇腫瘤的表面究竟有什麼? 有辦法使這些細胞平靜下來嗎? 他們之間的訊號非常雜亂，訊息傳遞的路徑一蹋糊塗 如何使他們回歸正軌呢? 這實在太棒了，我感到驚訝不已 這是之後我們所得到的"}, {"zh-tw": " We can revert the malignant phenotype. And in order to show you that the malignant phenotype I didn't just choose one, here are little movies, sort of fuzzy, but you see that on the left are the malignant cells, all of them are malignant, we add one single inhibitor in the beginning, and look what happens, they all look like that.", "en": " 我們成功的改正了細胞的惡性顯型 為了讓各位看到細胞的惡性顯型 我準備了另外的東西 這些小型影片，有點模糊 但我們能看到左邊那些是不正常的細胞 全部都是惡性的 我們在一開始加入了一個抗化劑 看看會發生什麼事，他們看起來就像這樣"}, {"zh-tw": " We inject them into the mouse, the ones on the right, and none of them would make tumors. We inject the other ones in the mouse, 100 percent tumors.", "en": " 我們將之注射到老鼠體內，如同右邊影片顯示 沒有半個細胞會變成腫瘤 我們將另一邊注入老鼠體內，腫瘤發生率卻變成100%"}, {"zh-tw": " So, it's a new way of thinking about cancer, it's a hopeful way of thinking about cancer. We should be able to be dealing with these things at this level, and these conclusions say that growth and malignant behavior is regulated at the level of tissue organization and that the tissue organization is dependent on the extracellular matrix and the microenvironment.", "en": " 這是對於癌症的一個新觀點 也是一個具有希望的新看法 我們有能力以這樣的水準來處理問題 從這些結論得知，細胞的成長與惡性演變 發生於組織層面 而組織則受到細胞外間質 和微小環境的影響"}, {"zh-tw": " All right, thus form and function interact dynamically and reciprocally. And here is another five seconds of repose, is my mantra. Form and function.", "en": " 因此，細胞的形態與功能活力的進行互動 現在這五秒鐘是一段沉澱時間 我用來沉澱心情的禱文: 形態與功能"}, {"zh-tw": " And of course, we now ask, where do we go now? We'd like to take this kind of thinking into the clinic. But before we do that, I'd like you to think that at any given time when you're sitting there, in your 70 trillion cells, the extracellular matrix signaling to your nucleus, the nucleus is signaling to your extracellular matrix and this is how your balance is kept and restored.", "en": " 現在各位當然很好奇，接下來我們該如何發展呢? 我們想把這個想法放進臨床治療中 在那之前，請各位想想 任何一個時刻，當你坐在那邊時 你體內的七十兆個細胞 胞外間質傳遞訊息給細胞核 細胞核也傳遞訊息給胞外間質 因此你體內維持著這樣的平衡"}, {"zh-tw": " We have made a lot of discoveries, we have shown that extracellular matrix talks to chromatin. We have shown that there's little pieces of DNA on the specific genes of the mammary gland that actually respond to extracellular matrix.", "en": " 我們發現許多東西 我們呈現了細胞外的母體與染色質的對話 我們展示了乳腺細胞特定的某個基因中，有一小部份的 DNA會對細胞外間質產生回應 DNA會對細胞外間質產生回應"}, {"zh-tw": " It has taken many years, but it has been very rewarding. And before I get to the next slide, I have to tell you that there are so many additional discoveries to be made.", "en": " 研究雖然花了許多年的時間，但卻收穫滿滿 在跳到下張投影片之前，我必須告訴各位 還有許多未知的探索等待進行"}, {"zh-tw": " There is so much mystery we don't know.

You need to always think, what else needs to be discovered? And maybe my discovery needs to be added to or maybe it needs to be changed.", "en": " 以及熱情 時時刻刻，你都必須想著還有什麼事情等待發掘? 或許我的發現需要更多補充 或是經過修改"}, {"zh-tw": " So, we have now made an amazing discovery, a post-doc in the lab who is a physicist asked me, what do the cells do when you put them in? What do they do in the beginning when they do? I said, I don't know, we couldn't look at them. We didn't have high images in the old days.", "en": " 現在我們有了這項驚人的發現 實驗室裡的一個博士後研究員兼物理學家，問我 當你把細胞放入時他們發生了什麼事? 一開始他們產生什麼變化? 我說我不曉得，我們無從觀察 早期我們還沒有高品質影像"}, {"zh-tw": " So she, being an imager and a physicist, did this incredible thing. This is a single human breast cell in three dimensions.", "en": " 這名學生呢，既是一個夢想家和物理學家 她做了這件驚人的設計 這是一個以3D影像顯示的人乳細胞"}, {"zh-tw": " Look at it. It's constantly doing this. Has a coherent movement.", "en": " 你看，它不斷的重複這個循環 有一個一致的動作"}, {"zh-tw": " You put the cancer cells there, and they do go all over, they do this. They don't do this.

What an exciting thing.", "en": " 完全令我驚訝不已 所以細胞的活動就像胚胎，這是多麼令人興奮的事啊"}, {"zh-tw": " So I'd like to finish with a poem. Well I used to love English literature, and I debated in college, which one should I do?
