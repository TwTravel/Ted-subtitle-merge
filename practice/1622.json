I'm a multitasking person, and I push my students to fly through a very creative, multitasking design process. But how efficient is, really, this multitasking? Let's consider for a while the option of monotasking."}, {"zh-tw": "舉幾個例子看看這個", "en": "A couple of examples. Look at that."}, {"zh-tw": "這就是我一心多用的結果所以我一邊烤肉、一邊回電話、發簡訊還上傳了幾張超讚的烤肉照片", "en": "This is my multitasking activity result. So trying to cook, answering the phone, writing SMS, and maybe uploading some pictures about this awesome barbecue."}, {"zh-tw": "那麼，總是有人講起多工超人的故事這百分之二的超人的確可以掌握一心多用的情境但我們行嗎？現實中可能嗎？你上一次單純只因為聽到朋友的聲音而感到愉快是多久以前的事了？所以這就是我正在做的計劃這是一系列的手機殻要把我們的超 —超多功能手機降級變回原有的單純功能", "en": "So someone tells us the story about supertaskers, so this two percent of people who are able to control multitasking environment.

But our multitasking reality is pretty different, and full of tons of information."}, {"zh-tw": "所以何不重拾我們的冒險精神？我知道在這個什麼都可能有的時代裡(約有95萬種應用程式供下載)談專心一致聽起來實在有點奇怪但我勸你考慮一次只專注一件事或乾脆把你的數位感官全都關掉現在，每個人都可以製造自己的單一產品", "en": "So what about something like that to rediscover our sense of adventure? I know that it could sound pretty weird to speak about mono when the number of possibilities is so huge, but I push you to consider the option of focusing on just one task, or maybe turning your digital senses totally off.
