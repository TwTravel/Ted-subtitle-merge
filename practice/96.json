I have to tell youI'm both challenged and excited. My excitement is: I get a chanceto give something back. My challenge is: the shortest seminarI usually do is 50 hours."}, {"zh-tw": "我並非誇大其詞。我會在週末進行，而我所作的...我所作的甚至不僅於此，顯然地，訓練人群...但我更相信沈浸式學習。因為你是怎麼學語言的？你並不是只靠學習原則來學語言的。你身置其中並經常使用，直至為真我在這兒的原因的底線是，除了當個瘋狂的混蛋以外是我真的正處於一個位置我並不是來這邊激勵你們的。很顯然地，你們並不需要", "en": "I'm not exaggerating. I do weekends -- I do more, obviously,I also coach people -- but I'm into immersion,because how did you learn language? Not just by learning principles, you got in it and you did itso often that it became real. The bottom line of why I'm here,besides being a crazy mofo, is that -- I'm not here to motivate you,you don't need that, obviously."}, {"zh-tw": "很多時候那是大多人認為我會做的事情但這卻是差最多的。真正發生的事情，是人們告訴我：「我不需要任何激勵」而我說：「噢！那可真是有趣！那不是我打算做的事情阿！」", "en": "Often that's what people think I do, and it's the furthest thing from it. What happens, though, is people say to me, \"I don't need any motivation.\" But that's not what I do."}, {"zh-tw": "我是「為什麼先生」，我想知道你行為背後的動機與原因。", "en": "I'm the \"why\" guy. I want to know why you do what you do."}, {"zh-tw": "你行為的動機是什麼？是什麼驅使你，直至今日之斯？而非十年前的樣子還是你不停在重複相同的模式？因為我相信在內心啟動驅策的無形力量是世界上最重要的事物", "en": "What is your motive for action? What is it that drives youin your life today? Not 10 years ago. Are you running the same pattern? Because I believe that the invisible forceof internal drive, activated, is the most important thing."}, {"zh-tw": "我在這裡，因為我相信情感是生命之力在這裡的所有人都有偉大的心智", "en": "I'm here because I believeemotion is the force of life. All of us here have great minds."}, {"zh-tw": "你知道嗎？我們大部份的人都有偉大的心智，對吧？其他方面我不清楚，但是我們都知道如何思考藉由我們的心智，我們能將任何事物合理化。", "en": "Most of us here have great minds, right? We all know how to think. With our minds we canrationalize anything."}, {"zh-tw": "我們能讓任何事情發生！我們可以...我同意我在數天前所聽聞的那個說大家都是為了自身利益而的工作的想法", "en": "We can make anything happen. I agree with what was describeda few days ago, that people work in their self-interest."}, {"zh-tw": "但我們都知道，有時候這真是狗屁不通你不會隨時隨地都為了你自身利益而工作因為當你的情感到位時就會以情感運作的方式來改變處理", "en": "But we know that that's bullshit at times. You don't work in yourself-interest all the time, because when emotion comes into it, the wiring changesin the way it functions."}, {"zh-tw": "對我們而言這是件多麼美妙的事，我們能有智慧的思考關於世界的生命到底是怎麼回事，尤其我們之中那些聰明人，能在腦中把這些事情完成但我真的想知道的是，到底是什麼在驅策你", "en": "So it's wonderful to think intellectuallyabout how the life of the world is, especially those who are very smartcan play this game in our head. But I really want to knowwhat's driving you."}, {"zh-tw": "而我想要邀請你做的是在我今天的演講之後，探索一下為何今天身置於此有兩個原因。其一：因為可以奉獻更多。其二", "en": "What I would like to invite you to do by the end of this talk is explorewhere you are today, for two reasons. One: so that you can contribute more."}, {"zh-tw": "我們希望能不只更了解其他人而或許可以更欣賞其他人，創造某種連結來阻止某些挑戰我們今日在社會所面對的挑戰這些挑戰只會越來越大隨著連結我們的科技讓我們產生更多交集，而這樣的交集", "en": "And two: that hopefully we can not justunderstand other people more, but appreciate them more,and create the kinds of connections that can stop some of the challengesthat we face today. They're only going to get magnifiedby the very technology that connects us, because it's making us intersect."}, {"zh-tw": "並不會總是產生這樣的觀點：「大家現在都更了解了解彼此且大家都更欣賞彼此。」所以， 基本上我著迷三十年了，而我著迷的事物一直是：「是什麼造成人們生活品質的不同？」「是什麼造成他們表現的不同？」因為我就是靠這個賺錢的所以我現在必須要產出成果這是我做了三十年的事情。我會接到電話", "en": "That intersectiondoesn't always create a view of \"everybody now understands everybody, and everybody appreciates everybody.\" I've had an obsessionbasically for 30 years, \"What makes the differencein the quality of people's lives? What in their performance?\" I got hired to produce the result now. I've done it for 30 years."}, {"zh-tw": "那頭是在國家電視台上精疲力竭的運動員他們領先五竿而他們現在沒辦法回到賽道上我就要馬上作點事情來產出成果否則就沒差了。我會接到電話", "en": "I get the phone call when the athlete is burning downon national television, and they were ahead by five strokes and now they can't get back on the course.

In 29 years, I'm very gratefulto tell you I've never lost one."}, {"zh-tw": "這並不表示我能一直維持不敗紀錄，但我過去還沒失手過原因就是我了解他們的這些人性需求，也就是我想告訴你們的所以，當我接到這些關於表現的電話時，這是一回事", "en": "It doesn't mean I won't some day,but I haven't yet. The reason is an understandingof these human needs."}, {"zh-tw": "你怎麼改變呢？同時，我也在尋找，看看到底是什麼在塑造這個人奉獻的能力能作超越他們本身的事情。所以也許真正的問題是，", "en": "When I get those callsabout performance, that's one thing. How do you make a change? I'm also looking to see what is shapingthe person's ability to contribute, to do something beyond themselves."}, {"zh-tw": "你知道的，我看著生命，說，有兩個重要的課題其一是：成就背後是有科學的幾乎每件事情都被作到了登峰造極的地步第一個課題是：「你怎麼把無形的力量化為有形？」對吧", "en": "Maybe the real question is, I look at life and saythere's two master lessons. One is: there's the scienceof achievement, which almost everyone herehas mastered amazingly."}, {"zh-tw": "你怎麼讓你自己夢寐以求的事物成真？不管是你的生意、對社會的貢獻、或是金錢？不管對你來說是什麼 - 你的身體、你的家庭但另外一個生命的課題，精通的人就少之又少了，就是自我實現的藝術因為科學是簡單的，對吧？", "en": "\"How do you take the invisibleand make it visible,\" How do you make your dreams happen? Your business, your contributionto society, money -- whatever, your body, your family. The other lesson that is rarelymastered is the art of fulfillment."}, {"zh-tw": "你知道規則，寫好程式碼，跟隨...然後就得到結果。只要你知道這遊戲的方式你就，你知道的，你就會加碼，對吧！但自我實現就是藝術了！", "en": "Because science is easy, right? We know the rules, you write the codeand you get the results. Once you know the game,you just up the ante, don't you? But when it comesto fulfillment -- that's an art."}, {"zh-tw": "原因是，自我實現是欣賞是奉獻。靠自己，你只能感覺到那些。", "en": "The reason is, it's aboutappreciation and contribution. You can only feel so much by yourself."}, {"zh-tw": "所以，我有個有趣的實驗室來回答這個問題。這個問題中的問題，也就是這些人生命的差異到底在哪？若你看著這些人這些人是你所奉獻一切的人。就像是他們所聲稱他們所需要的所有資源，你給他們的不只是百元電腦而給他們最好的電腦。你給他們愛", "en": "I've had an interesting laboratoryto try to answer the real question how somebody's life changes if you look at them like those peoplethat you've given everything to? Like all the resources they say they need. You gave not a 100-dollar computer,but the best computer."}, {"zh-tw": "給他們歡樂，你撫慰他們而這些人經常，你知道的，至少我確定他們其中的一些在餘生中帶著這些愛、教育、金錢與其他背景，在戒護所中進出，揮霍餘生", "en": "You gave them love, joy,were there to comfort them. Those people very often --you know some of them -- end up the rest of their life with all this love, education,money and background going in and out of rehab."}, {"zh-tw": "之後你遇見經歷了極大痛苦的人心理上、性上、心靈上、感情受創雖然不總是如此，但經常是這樣，他們會變成對社會貢獻最多的那群人之一所以我們真的必須要問我們自己的問題是，到底是什麼？到底是什麼在塑造我們？我們活在一個治療文化中", "en": "Some people have beenthrough ultimate pain, psychologically, sexually,spiritually, emotionally abused -- and not always, but often, they become some of the peoplethat contribute the most to society. The question we've got to askourselves really is, what is it? What is it that shapes us? We live in a therapy culture."}, {"zh-tw": "我們之中大部分的人都不會這樣作，但是我們的文化就是治療文化而我這樣說的意思表示我相信我們都是過去的積累。每個在這個房間的人，如果相信治療文化的理論你就不會在這個房間裡了但是，大部分的社會都認為一生中發生的事情是命定的", "en": "Most of us don't do that,but the culture's a therapy culture, the mindset that we are our past. And you wouldn't be in this roomif you bought that, but most of societythinks biography is destiny."}, {"zh-tw": "過去等同未來，當然是這樣若你這樣認為但在這房間的人都知道", "en": "The past equals the future. Of course it does if you live there."}, {"zh-tw": "我們必須提醒我們自己因為你有智識，知道一些事，你知道要作什麼但沒有使用、沒有運用所以我們真的要提醒我們自己下決定才是最終的力量。就真的是這樣。", "en": "But what we know and whatwe have to remind ourselves -- because you can knowsomething intellectually and then not use it, not apply it. We've got to remind ourselvesthat decision is the ultimate power."}, {"zh-tw": "現在，當你問別人「你曾經沒辦法達成某事嗎？」「有多少人在生命中曾經沒辦法達成重要的事情？」有的說「有」群眾：「有」東尼‧羅賓斯：謝謝你們的高度互動。", "en": "When you ask people, have you failed to achievesomething significant in your life? Say, \"Aye.\" Audience: Aye. TR: Thanks for the interactionon a high level there."}, {"zh-tw": "但如果你問別人，為什麼你不去成就某件事情？例如在你手下做事的人，或是工作夥伴或甚至是你自己，當你沒辦法達成目標時人們會給自己沒辦法達成的原因是什麼他們會告訴你什麼？因為沒有...就是知道得不夠沒有...知識。沒有...錢。沒有...時間。沒有...技術。你知道的。", "en": "But if you ask people,why didn't you achieve something? Somebody who's working for you,or a partner, or even yourself. When you fail to achieve,what's the reason people say? What do they tell you? Didn't have the knowledge,didn't have the money, didn't have the time,didn't have the technology."}, {"zh-tw": "沒有對的經理人，沒有...高爾：最高法院！", "en": "I didn't have the right manager. Al Gore: Supreme Court.TR: The Supreme Court."}, {"zh-tw": "東尼‧羅賓斯：還有...還有...這些東西，包含最高法院在內，有什麼共同點？這些事物都能聲稱你缺少資源，且可能是真確的！你可能沒錢，也可能沒有最高法院但是這不是關鍵因素！", "en": "(Cheering) (Applause continues) TR: And -- What do all those, includingthe Supreme Court, have in common? They are a claim to you missingresources, and they may be accurate. You may not have the money,or the Supreme Court, but that is not the defining factor."}, {"zh-tw": "糾正我！如果我錯了！關鍵因素從來都不是資源，而是善用資源的能力！", "en": "And you correct me if I'm wrong. The defining factor is never resources;it's resourcefulness."}, {"zh-tw": "我的意思是，讓我更精確的說如果你有情感，人類的情感，就像前日我從你身上體驗的一樣強烈與我所經驗過的情感一樣深刻，而你曾用這樣的情感溝通過我相信你一定能贏過他！但是，對我來說告訴他應該作甚麼是多麼簡單的事情！", "en": "And what I mean specifically,rather than just some phrase, is if you have emotion, human emotion, something that I experienced from youthe day before yesterday at a level that is as profoundas I've ever experienced and I believe with that emotionyou would have beat his ass and won.

But I know when we watchedthe debate at that time, there were emotionsthat blocked people's ability to get this man's intellect and capacity."}, {"zh-tw": "而在那天這場合讓一些人偶然碰上了因為我知道一切人，他們本來想投你，但後來卻沒有我對此不太高興。但，情緒在那裡，就在那裡！有多少人知道我在說什麼？說：「有」", "en": "And the way that it came acrossto some people on that day -- because I know people that wantedto vote in your direction and didn't, and I was upset. But there was emotion there."}, {"zh-tw": "群眾：「有」東尼‧羅賓斯：所以，就是情緒了。而如果我們有了正確的情緒", "en": "Do you know what I'm talking about? Say, \"Aye.\" Audience: Aye. TR: So, emotion is it."}, {"zh-tw": "我們就能讓作成任何事情。我們能撐過去如果你夠有創意、夠有玩興、夠有趣你能跟所有人打成一片嗎？能不能？群眾：能東尼‧羅賓斯：如果你沒有錢，但你夠有創意與決心你會找到方法，所以這就是終極的資源", "en": "And if we get the right emotion,we can get ourselves to do anything. If you're creative, playful, fun enough, can you get through to anybody, yes or no? If you don't have the money, but you're creative and determined,you find the way."}, {"zh-tw": "但這不是大家告訴我們的，對吧？", "en": "This is the ultimate resource. But this is not the storythat people tell us."}, {"zh-tw": "大家告訴我們的是一堆不同的故事。他們說如果我們沒有資源，但終究如果你看看投影片，請抬頭，如果你願意的話他們說，他們還沒完成的原因到底總共有哪些？請換下一張。他打破了我的模式，那混蛋！", "en": "They tell us a bunch of different stories. They tell us we don't havethe resources, but ultimately, if you take a look here, they say, what are all the reasonsthey haven't accomplished that? He's broken my pattern,that son-of-a-bitch."}, {"zh-tw": "但我告訴你，我還是感謝他的活力決定你的資源的是什麼？我們說過決定會影響命運這是我的重點。如果決定會影響命運，那會影響的", "en": "But I appreciated the energy,I'll tell you that.

We've said decisions shape destiny,which is my focus here."}, {"zh-tw": "就是三個決定？你要把焦點放在哪邊？現在，如果你要決定你要把焦點放在哪邊", "en": "If decisions shape destiny,what determines it is three decisions. What will you focus on? You have to decidewhat you're going to focus on."}, {"zh-tw": "在這秒鐘，不管有意識還是無意識地，當你決定要決定的那一分鐘你就必須給你決定要聚焦的事物一個意義而這個意義就會產生情緒", "en": "Consciously or unconsciously. the minute you decide to focus,you must give it a meaning, and that meaning produces emotion."}, {"zh-tw": "這是結束還是開始呢？神是在處罰我？還是犒賞我呢？還是這就像是丟骰子一樣不確定？之後某種情緒，就會創造我們的下一步或是行動所以，想想你的人生塑造你命運的決定", "en": "Is this the end or the beginning? Is God punishing me or rewarding me,or is this the roll of the dice? An emotion createswhat we're going to do, or the action.

You see that South America and Africamay be connected in a certain way, right? Others say, \"Oh, that soundsridiculous.\" It's simple."}, {"zh-tw": "是什麼決定你的？兩股無形的力量。很快談談。其一：狀態我們都有過這樣的時刻若你有過這樣的時刻：你在做了某事後，做完之後你開始覺得，我真不敢相信我這麼說了我真不敢相信我這麼做了，那真是有夠笨，有誰有過這種經驗的說：「有」群眾：「有」", "en": "So, what shaped Lance? What shapes you? Two invisible forces.Very quickly. One: state.

It's made up of three parts."}, {"zh-tw": "首先，你的目標是什麼？你追求的是什麼？我相信，這跟你的欲望不同。你可以有欲望或是目標。有多少人設立過目標", "en": "First, what's your target?What are you after? It's not your desires.

Say, \"Aye.\" Audience: Aye. It's needs we have. I believethere are six human needs."}, {"zh-tw": "其次，一旦你知道驅策你的目標是什麼而你真實的發現目標，不需要形成目標，發現就好那你就會找到你的地圖是什麼那就是你的信仰體系，告訴你如何得到那些需求有些人覺得滿足那些需求要毀滅世界有些人覺得要建造一些事物、創造一些事物，或是愛某人", "en": "Second, once you know what the targetthat's driving you is and you uncover it for the truth --you don't form it -- then you find out what's your map, what's the belief systemsthat tell you how to get those needs. Some people think the wayto get them is to destroy the world, some people, to build,create something, love someone."}, {"zh-tw": "所以你要選擇你的驅策力。很快帶過，六大需求。讓我告訴你這些分別是什麼。其一：確定性。", "en": "There's the fuel you pick.So very quickly, six needs. Let me tell you what they are.First one: certainty."}, {"zh-tw": "現在所談的這些不是目標也不是渴望，是放諸四海皆準的每個人都需要能夠避免痛苦的確定性或至少能舒服的確定性。那要怎麼獲得呢？", "en": "These are not goals or desires,these are universal. Everyone needs certaintythey can avoid pain and at least be comfortable."}, {"zh-tw": "控制他人？培養技能？放棄？抽根煙？如果你能完全確定，很諷刺的即便我們都需要你若不確定你的健康、你的子女你的金錢，你就不會想那麼多你不確定天花板會不會掉下來你不會聽任何講者說話", "en": "Now, how do you get it? Control everybody? Develop a skill?Give up? Smoke a cigarette? And if you got totallycertain, ironically, even though we need that -- you're not certain about your health,or your children, or money. If you're not surethe ceiling will hold up, you won't listen to any speaker."}, {"zh-tw": "但當我們都以不同的方式獲得確定性，若我們得到完全的確定性後我們會得到什麼？你若感覺確定時，你覺得如何？你知道什麼會發生？何時會發生？會如何發生？那你感覺會怎樣。你會覺得無聊至極！所以，天阿，以她無窮盡的智慧。（譯按：玩笑話，因為應為男性「他」）給我們第二個人類需求吧，也就是不確定性我們需要變化，我們需要驚喜", "en": "While we go for certainty differently,if we get total certainty, we get what? What do you feel if you're certain? You know what will happen,when and how it will happen, what would you feel? Bored out of your minds.So, God, in Her infinite wisdom, gave us a second human need,which is uncertainty. We need variety. We need surprise."}, {"zh-tw": "在座多少人喜歡驚喜？說：「有」群眾：「有」東尼‧羅賓斯：胡說！你喜歡的是你想要的驚喜。", "en": "How many of you herelove surprises? Say, \"Aye.\" Audience: Aye. TR: Bullshit. You likethe surprises you want."}, {"zh-tw": "你不想要的驚喜你稱之為問題，但你需要他們所以，變化性是很重要的，你有租過你已經看過的", "en": "The ones you don't want,you call problems, but you need them.

The fastest way to do this, if you have no background,no culture, no belief and resources or resourcefulness, is violence."}, {"zh-tw": "而我又跟你住同一個社區，我馬上就有了重要性0-10分，有多高呢？10分！我有多麼重要阿！", "en": "If I put a gun to your head and I livein the 'hood, instantly I'm significant. Zero to 10. How high? 10."}, {"zh-tw": "你要怎麼對我回應？10分！有多少不確定性？誰知道接下來會發生什麼？蠻刺激的。像是爬進洞穴後做做看這種事情", "en": "How certain am I thatyou're going to respond to me? 10. How much uncertainty? Who knows what's going to happen next?Kind of exciting."}, {"zh-tw": "一路爬進去。完全是變化性與不確定性。所以是重要的，是吧？如果你想冒生命的險", "en": "Like climbing up into a caveand doing that stuff all the way down there. Total variety and uncertainty."}, {"zh-tw": "那就為什麼暴力總是在我們的周遭，且會一直持續下去除非我們整個種族產生有意識的改變現在，你可以有百萬種方式來得到重要性", "en": "And it's significant, isn't it?So you want to risk your life for it. So that's why violence has alwaysbeen around and will be around unless we have a consciousnesschange as a species."}, {"zh-tw": "但若要變得重要，你必須要獨一無二、與眾不同。我們真的需要的是：愛與連結。也就是第四種需要。我們都需要。大部分的人會定下來就是為了連結", "en": "You can get significance a million ways, but to be significant, you've gotto be unique and different.
