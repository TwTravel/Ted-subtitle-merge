What is more important: the total number of readersof a post you write, or who are the people who have impactthat read what you write? Couldn't we just give people moreincentives to engage in conversations, rather than just broadcastingopinions all the time? Or reward people for reading and responding to viewsthat they disagree with? And also, make it socially acceptablethat we change our minds, or probably even reward that? What if we have a matrix that sayshow many people changed their minds, and that becomes partof our social media experience? If I could track how many peopleare changing their minds, I'd probably write morethoughtfully, trying to do that, rather than appealing to the peoplewho already agree with me and \"liking\" because I justconfirmed their biases. We also need to think about effectivecrowdsourcing mechanisms, to fact-check widely spreadonline information, and reward people who take part in that.", "en": " 但如果我們更加注重品質呢？ 以下哪個比較重要： 是看到你寫的東西的總人數， 還是哪些具有影響力的人 在讀你寫的東西？ 我們難道不能讓大家有更多誘因投入對話， 而不是一直宣傳自己的觀點嗎？ 或是獎勵大家閱讀 並回應與自己相左的觀點？ 並且，讓「改變想法」變成可被社會接納， 甚至可能獲得獎勵？ 如果我們有個計算方程式，告訴我們 有多人少改變了他們的想法， 讓這成為社群媒體使用模式的一部分呢？ 如果我能追蹤有多少人正在改變想法， 我在發文時可能會更深思熟慮， 而不只是吸引已經同意我的觀點的人， 並因為我確認了他們的偏見而被按「讚」。 我們也得想想有效集思廣益的機制， 針對廣為流傳的線上訊息進行查實， 並獎勵願意這麼做的人。"}, {"zh-tw": " In essence, we need to rethinktoday's social media ecosystem and redesign its experiences to reward thoughtfulness, civilityand mutual understanding. As a believer in the Internet,I teamed up with a few friends, started a new project, trying to find answersand explore possibilities.", "en": " 在本質上，我們得重新思考今天的社群媒體生態， 並重新設計它的使用模式， 來獎勵深思熟慮、守禮自持與彼此瞭解。 做為一個網路的信徒，我和幾個朋友組成團隊， 開始一個新的計劃， 試著找出解答並探索更多可能性。"}, {"zh-tw": " Our first product is a newmedia platform for conversations. We're hosting conversationsthat promote mutual understanding and hopefully change minds.", "en": " 我們的第一個產品是一種談話式的新社群平台。 我們主持一些有助彼此瞭解的對話， 希望能改變大家的想法。"}, {"zh-tw": " We don't claim to have the answers, but we started experimentingwith different discussions about very divisive issues, such as race, gun control,the refugee debate, relationship between Islam and terrorism. These are conversations that matter.", "en": " 我們並不求有所解答， 但我們開始試驗一些不同的討論， 針對一些非常爭議的議題， 例如種族、槍枝管制、有關難民的爭論、 還有伊斯蘭與恐怖主義之間的關係。 這些都是重要的對談。"}, {"zh-tw": " Today, at least one out of threepeople on the planet have access to the Internet.
