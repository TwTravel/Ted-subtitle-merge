A few years ago, oddly enough, I needed the bathroom, and I found one, a public bathroom, and I went into the stall, and I prepared to do what I'd done most of my life: use the toilet, flush the toilet, forget about the toilet. And for some reason that day, instead, I asked myself a question, and it was, where does this stuff go? And with that question, I found myself plunged into the world of sanitation -- there's more coming --  — sanitation, toilets and poop, and I have yet to emerge.", "en": " 我們來說點\"髒話\"吧 幾年前 奇怪的是 我需要去上廁所 我找到了一間公共廁所 我走進廁所間的時候 正要準備做我這一生常做的事 那就是方便後 沖水 再將一切拋諸腦後 不知道什麼原因 那天 我反而問了自己一個問題 那就是 這些東西會到哪裡？ 這個問題使我陷入了-- 一個關於衛生的世界-- 後面還有呢 ---- 一個關於衛生、馬桶以及糞便的世界 而我至今還未浮上來"}, {"zh-tw": " And that's because it's such an enraging, yet engaging place to be. To go back to that toilet, it wasn't a particularly fancy toilet, it wasn't as nice as this one from the World Toilet Organization.", "en": " 因為 那是個多麼令人激動 又令人著迷的世界 回到馬桶的故事 那個馬桶並沒有什麼特別之處 也沒有比 「世界馬桶組織」的馬桶來的好"}, {"zh-tw": " That's the other WTO.

Forty percent of the world with no adequate toilet.", "en": " 他們沒有一個桶子或箱子 全世界有百分之四十的人沒有馬桶"}, {"zh-tw": " And they have to do what this little boy is doing by the side of the Mumbai Airport expressway, which is called open defecation, or poo-pooing in the open.

He'll run back into his house, and he will contaminate his drinking water and his food and his environment with whatever diseases he may be carrying by fecal particles that are on his fingers and feet.

We don't have a neutral word for it.", "en": " 我覺得它真的很棒--不會臭 可以把它放在房子裡把它鎖在門後面 可是同時我們也把它鎖在談話之外 對於糞便 我們沒有中性詞"}, {"zh-tw": " Poop's not particularly adequate. Shit offends people. Feces is too medical.", "en": " “便便”並不非常適當 “屎”又會得罪人“排泄物”又太醫學了"}, {"zh-tw": " Because I can't explain otherwise, when I look at the figures, what's going on. We know how to solve diarrhea and sanitation, but if you look at the budgets of countries, developing and developed, you'll think there's something wrong with the math, because you'll expect absurdities like Pakistan spending 47 times more on its military than it does on water and sanitation, even though 150,000 children die of diarrhea in Pakistan every year.", "en": " 我沒有其他辦法可以解釋 當我看到這些數據代表了什麼 我們知道要如何解決腹瀉與環境衛生的問題 可是如果你們看看這些國家的預算 不管是發展中國家還是已發展國家 你會覺得哪裏好像算錯了 因為你會預期一些荒謬的情況 像是 巴基斯坦花在軍事上的錢 比花在水源與環境衛生的錢高出47倍 儘管每年巴基斯坦會有 十五萬位孩童死於腹瀉"}, {"zh-tw": " But then you look at that already minuscule water and sanitation budget, and 75 to 90 percent of it will go on clean water supply, which is great; we all need water.

So a toilet can put a girl back in school.", "en": " 我認為在廢物處理上真正的浪費 就是我們浪費掉把它轉化成資源的可能 也浪費掉把它轉化成激起巨大發展的可能 因為馬桶以及糞便 能為我們達成很多事 馬桶可以使一個女孩回到學校"}, {"zh-tw": " Twenty-five percent of girls in India drop out of school because they have no adequate sanitation.

And I understand that. Who can blame them? So if you met an educationalist and said, \"I can improve education attendance rates by 25 percent with just one simple thing,\" you'd make a lot of friends in education.", "en": " 我們都做過，可是她們每天都如此 當她們進入青春期的時候開始有月經 對她們來說已經無法承受了 我能理解她們 誰能怪她們呢？ 所以如果你對一個教育學者說 “我可以用一個簡單的方法” “將學校出席率提高百分之25” 你在教育界就會交到許多朋友"}, {"zh-tw": " That's not the only thing it can do for you. Poop can cook your dinner.", "en": " 這還不是全部 糞便可以使你飽餐一頓"}, {"zh-tw": " It's got nutrients in it. We ingest nutrients. We excrete nutrients as well.", "en": " 糞便裡有營養素 我們吃進營養，同時也排出營養"}, {"zh-tw": " We don't keep them all. In Rwanda, they are now getting 75 percent of their cooking fuel in their prison system from the contents of prisoners' bowels.", "en": " 我們不會留住所有的營養 在盧安達的監獄 百分之75的烹飪燃料 是來自囚犯腸道中的物質"}, {"zh-tw": " So these are a bunch of inmates in a prison in Butare. They're genocidal inmates, most of them, and they're stirring the contents of their own latrines, because if you put poop in a sealed environment, in a tank, pretty much like a stomach, then, pretty much like a stomach, it gives off gas, and you can cook with it.", "en": " 這些犯人被囚禁在位於布塔雷的監獄 大部份的犯人都參與了種族滅絕的行動 他們在攪拌自己的排泄物 如果你把糞便放在密封的環境里，譬如一個儲槽 就像胃一樣 所以呢 像胃一樣 會有氣體產生 而你可以運用氣體來烹飪"}, {"zh-tw": " And you might think it's just good karma to see these guys stirring shit, but it's also good economic sense, because they're saving a million dollars a year. They're cutting down on deforestation, and they've found a fuel supply that is inexhaustible, infinite and free at the point of production.", "en": " 你可能覺得 這些人現在要攪拌自己的屎 是得到應有的報應 可這也是符合經濟概念的 因為他們一年可以省下一百萬元 他們減少了森林砍伐 也找到了一種用不完的、 無限的、免費生產的燃料來源"}, {"zh-tw": " It's not just in the poor world that poop can save lives. Here's a woman who's about to get a dose of the brown stuff in those syringes, which is what you think it is, except not quite, because it's actually donated.", "en": " 糞便並不只在貧窮國家挽救生命 這個女人正被 注射一劑棕色物體 這個物體跟你想的沒錯 可並不完全如此 因為它是被捐贈的"}, {"zh-tw": " There is now a new career path called stool donor. It's like the new sperm donor.", "en": " 現在有一個新的職業道路叫做“糞便捐贈者” 就像最近流行的的“精液捐贈者”"}, {"zh-tw": " Because she has been suffering from a superbug called C. diff, and it's resistant to antibiotics in many cases. She's been suffering for years.", "en": " 因為她被一種超級病毒感染叫做艱難酸菌 此病菌很多時候都對抗生素有抗藥性 她患病已經多年了"}, {"zh-tw": " She gets a dose of healthy human feces, and the cure rate for this procedure is 94 percent. It's astonishing, but hardly anyone is still doing it.", "en": " 她只要一劑健康的人類糞便 這個程序的治癒率是百分之九十四 效果令人訝異可是接受此程序的人寥寥無幾"}, {"zh-tw": " Maybe it's the ick factor. That's okay, because there's a team of research scientists in Canada who have now created a stool sample, a fake stool sample which is called RePOOPulate.", "en": " 可能覺得噁心吧 不過沒關係，因為加拿大有一組 研究科學家已經做出糞便的樣本-- 一個假的糞便樣本 叫做 RePOOPulate"}, {"zh-tw": " So you'd be thinking by now, okay, the solution's simple, we give everyone a toilet. And this is where it gets really interesting, because it's not that simple, because we are not simple.", "en": " 你現在可能在想 好吧 解決辦法很簡單 我們給大家一個馬桶就好了 這就是有趣的地方 因為事情並不簡單，我們也沒那麼簡單"}, {"zh-tw": " So the really interesting, exciting work -- this is the engaging bit -- in sanitation is that we need to understand human psychology. We need to understand software as well as just giving someone hardware.", "en": " 所以真正有趣又令人興奮的工作 -- 公共衛生的工作裡迷人的地方 就是我們需要了解人類心理學 我們需要了解\"軟體\" 也要了解直接給予\"硬體\"的問題"}, {"zh-tw": " They've found in many developing countries that governments have gone in and given out free latrines and gone back a few years later and found that they've got lots of new goat sheds or temples or spare rooms with their owners happily walking past them and going over to the open defecating ground. So the idea is to manipulate human emotion.", "en": " 我們發現 很多發展中國家的政府 都有給予免費的公共廁所 可是幾年後卻發現 那裡多出了新的羊棚、神殿或空房 建築的主人還開開心心的路過那裡 走到開放排便地去上廁所 所以我們的主要理念是要操縱人們的情緒"}, {"zh-tw": " It's been done for decades. The soap companies did it in the early 20th century. They tried selling soap as healthy. No one bought it.", "en": " 此方法已經使用了好幾十年 在二十世紀初的時候 一些肥皂公司用過這個方法 他們試過用健康的角度推銷肥皂 但沒人要買"}, {"zh-tw": " They tried selling it as sexy. Everyone bought it.

That's what really made them change their behavior.", "en": " 莫名其妙的，那些本來覺得 自己做的事並不噁心的人們 頓時領悟，“慘了” 也想到他們還間接吃進了鄰居的屎 這才是真正讓他們改變行為的原因"}, {"zh-tw": " So this woman, this boy's mother installed this latrine in a few hours.

We're not going to meet targets, providing people with sanitation at this rate.", "en": " 此目標落後了差不多50年之久 我們不會達到預期目標 在這個情況下提供人們衛生設備"}, {"zh-tw": " So when I get sad about sanitation, I think of Japan, because Japan 70 years ago was a nation of people who used pit latrines and wiped with sticks, and now it's a nation of what are called Woshurettos, washlet toilets. They have in-built bidet nozzles for a lovely, hands-free cleaning experience, and they have various other features like a heated seat and an automatic lid-raising device which is known as the \"marriage-saver.\" But most importantly, what they have done in Japan, which I find so inspirational, is they've brought the toilet out from behind the locked door.", "en": " 所以當我對環境衛生感到憂心 我會想到日本，因為70年前 日本是一個使用坑式廁所的國家 他們用樹枝擦屁股 現在日本是個我們稱之為“衛洗麗”的國家 也就是所謂的免治馬桶 它們有內裝式的淨身噴嘴讓你無需用手 就可以享受到美好的清潔體驗 同時也有其他不同的特點 像是加熱座椅以及自動提高馬桶蓋裝置 也被稱之為“婚姻的救世主” 可最重要的，我覺得他們在日本 做的非常勵志的一點是 他們把馬桶的議題從鎖上的門中帶了出來"}, {"zh-tw": " They've made it conversational. People go out and upgrade their toilet.", "en": " 他們將馬桶加入談話裡 人們會去升級改良自己的馬桶"}, {"zh-tw": " They talk about it. They've sanitized it. I hope that we can do that.
