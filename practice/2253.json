As we move more and more into cities, the city flag will becomenot just a symbol of that city as a place, but also, it could become a symbolof how that city considers design itself, especially today, as the populaceis becoming more design-aware."}, {"zh-tw": "我認為，設計意識正處於歷史高位。一支設計出色的旗幟可以反映一個城市如何看待自身的設計體系：城市的大眾捷運、城市公園、城市標牌。", "en": "And I think design awarenessis at an all-time high. A well-designed flag could be seenas an indicator of how a city considers all of its design systems: its public transit, its parks, its signage."}, {"zh-tw": "看似無足輕重，但其實很重要。凱伊：通常當市領導說：「我們有更要緊的事做，而不是擔憂一支市旗。」我的反應是：「如果你有一支出色的市旗，你會有一張旗幟去團結大眾共同面對更要緊的事情。」馬斯：我見證過一流市旗的力量，在芝加哥的時候。", "en": "It might seem frivolous, but it's not. TK: Often when city leaders say, \"We have more important things to dothan worry about a city flag,\" my response is, \"If you had a great city flag, you would have a bannerfor people to rally under to face those more important things.\" (Music) RM: I've seen firsthandwhat a good city flag can do in the case of Chicago."}, {"zh-tw": "優秀設計和市民驕傲的完美結合是我們在任何地方都需要的元素。市旗最誘人的一點是我們有擁有權。", "en": "The marriage of good designand civic pride is something that we need in all places. The best part about municipal flagsis that we own them."}, {"zh-tw": "市旗是開放資源，是公眾共有的社區設計語言。市旗做得好，就會有很強的適應力和混搭力，也會帶來很大的力量。", "en": "They are an open-source, publicly owned design languageof the community.
