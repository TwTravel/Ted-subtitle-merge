Why is it that whenmy daughter dresses up, whether it's Groot or The Incredible Hulk, whether it's Obi-Wan Kenobi or Darth Maul, why is every charactershe dresses up as a boy?

That is, it is how societiesare taught ideologies.", "en": " 我真正的問題是：跟超級女英雄有關的東西都在哪裡？ 她們的戲服，玩具都在哪裡？ 因為當女兒每天打扮自己玩的時候 她也在學習。 作為一個研究媒體的教授， 這種過程在我的行業 叫做公共教育學。 這是社會灌輸意識型態的方式，"}, {"zh-tw": " It's how you learned what it meantto be a man or a woman, what it meant to behaveyourself in public, what it meant to be a patriotand have good manners.

Well, there's a wrinkle in that, in that our society, media don't simply exist as informationdistribution technologies and devices.", "en": " 所以在社會中 我們學習關於其他人與世界的一切時， 主要都是透過媒體。 然而，這裡也有小問題： 因為在我們的社會中， 媒體不單是傳播信息的科技與工具，"}, {"zh-tw": " They also exist as corporate entities. And when the distribution of informationis tied to financial gain, there's a problem.", "en": " 他們同樣以企業的形式存在。 當信息的傳播與金錢的利益掛勾 問題就出現了。"}, {"zh-tw": " How big of a problem? Well think about this: in 1983, 90 percent of American mediawere owned by 50 companies.

Because in media studies, we spend a lot of time sayingthat media can't tell us what to think, and they can't; they're terrible at that. But that's not their job.", "en": " 所以我給你的問題是， 如果六家公司控制住美國百分之九十的媒體， 你認為他們對你每天所能看到的有多大的控制呢？ 因為在媒體研究中。 我們花了大量時間申明媒體無法告訴我們應思考甚麼。 他們不能，而且他們做得很糟糕， 但那畢竟不是他們的工作。"}, {"zh-tw": " Media don't tell us what to think.

Let's talk about the Walt DisneyCompany for a second.", "en": " 來看個簡單的。 我們現在來看看華特迪士尼公司，"}, {"zh-tw": " The reason why I always pickthe Walt Disney Company is this. Is there a single person in this roomwho has never seen a Disney movie? Look around. Exactly.", "en": " 我總是選華特迪士尼公司是因為， 在場有哪位從來沒有看過一部迪士尼的電影？ 仔細看看四周。"}, {"zh-tw": " I picked Disney because they havewhat we call 100 percent penetration in our society. Every single personhas been exposed to Disney, so it's an easy one for me to use.", "en": " 我選擇迪士尼因為他們擁有所謂的百分百滲透。 在我們的社會中， 迪士尼影響著所有人， 所以對我來講這是個方便的例子。"}, {"zh-tw": " Since 1937, Disney has made mostof its money selling princesses to girls. It's made a huge chunk of its money.", "en": " 從1937年開始，迪士尼通過給女孩子賣公主玩具 賺得盤滿缽滿。"}, {"zh-tw": " Unless, of course, the princessyour daughter is interested in, as my daughter is, is this one. See, in 2012, Disney purchased LucasFilmfor the sum of four billion dollars, and immediately they floodedthe Disney stores with Han Solo and Obi-Wan Kenobi, with Darth Vaderand Luke Skywalker and Yoda and not Princess Leia.", "en": " 當然，除非你的女兒對公主沒興趣， 比如我女兒。 看看，在2012年， 迪士尼花了總數四十億美金買下了盧卡斯電影公司。 接著迪士尼商店內是鋪天蓋地的韓・蘇洛， 還有歐比王・肯諾比，達斯・維達路克・天行者以及尤達， 但就是沒有莉亞公主。"}, {"zh-tw": " Why? Because this princessmesses up the public pedagogy for these princesses. So Disney did not put Princess Leiamerchandise in the store, and when people went to Disney and said, \"Hey, where's allthe Princess Leia stuff?\" Disney said, \"We have no intention of putting Princess Leiamerchandise in the store.\" And fans were angryand they took to Twitter with the hashtag #WeWantLeia.", "en": " 為甚麼？因為這個公主 ‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌跟公主的形象有出入。 所以迪士尼沒有把莉亞公主的商品擺放在店裡。 當人們到迪士尼說： 那些莉亞公主的周邊商品呢： 迪士尼說「我們沒有計畫 售賣莉亞公主的商品。」 粉絲超級生氣，把這件事發表到了推特， 標籤名叫“我們要莉亞”。（#WeWantLeia）"}, {"zh-tw": " And Disney said,\"Wait, that's not what we meant. What we meant was, we don't have any Princess Leiamerchandise yet, but we will.\" And that was in 2012, and it is 2015, and if you go to the Disney Store,as I recently have, and look for Princess Leia merchandise, do you know how many Princess Leiaitems there are in the Disney Store? Zero, because Disney has no intentionof putting Princess Leia in the store.", "en": " 然後迪士尼說「等下,這不是我們的意思。 我們的意思是 目前我們尚沒有任何莉亞公主的商品，但是我們會生產的。」 那是2012年的事情，現在已經2015年了， 如果你像我一樣最近去過迪士尼的商店， 尋找莉亞公主的商品， 你知道店裡有多少莉亞公主擺出來嗎？ 零個，因為迪士尼並不打算把莉亞公主放到店鋪裡。"}, {"zh-tw": " And we shouldn't be surprisedbecause we found out that was their policy when they bought Marvel in 2009 for the sum of 4.5 billion dollars. Because when you make a lot of moneyselling princesses to girls, you also kind of wantto make money from boys.", "en": " 而且我們不應該感到驚訝，因為這就是迪士尼的政策。 就像在2009年，迪士尼 花了45億美金買下漫威。 因為當你賺錢的方式是賣公主給女孩， 你也想要從男孩手裡賺錢。"}, {"zh-tw": " And so what better to sell boysthan superheroes? So now Disney had accessto Captain America and to Thor, The Incredible Hulk, and they had access even to a group of superheroesno one had ever even heard of. That's how good Marvel wasat selling superheroes.", "en": " 那麼，還有甚麼比給男孩賣超級英雄更好的方式呢？ 所以迪士尼現在已經擁有美國隊長以及雷神， 綠巨人， 他們甚至擁有 一組從未有人聽說過的英雄 漫威總是能令超級英雄暢銷。"}, {"zh-tw": " Last year, they released a filmcalled \"Guardians of the Galaxy.\" It's a film that absolutelyshould not work.

And we were very excited.", "en": " 現在，我可以給推特上貼標籤#葛摩菈到哪去了， 就好像世界上百萬粉絲過去做的那樣。 但是真相是，我沒有一絲驚訝： 因為當迪士尼發布《復仇者聯盟》時，我也在現場。 就在今年，一部新的復仇者聯盟電影《奧創紀元》上映了， 我們當時超級激動， 因為裡面有兩個超級女英雄： 緋紅女巫與黑寡婦。 我們超級激動，"}, {"zh-tw": " But here's the real thing about this.
