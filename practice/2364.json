I'm going to call her Ella.", "en": " 所以我告訴大家一位有這樣遭遇的人。 我打算叫她艾拉。"}, {"zh-tw": " Ella lives in a British cityon a run down estate. The shops are closed, the pub's gone, the playground's pretty desolateand never used, and inside Ella's house,the tension is palpable and the noise levels are deafening.", "en": " 艾拉住在英國一座城市 那裡商店倒閉，酒館關門， 遊樂場荒廢，沒有遊人， 艾拉家 喧鬧聲震耳欲聾。"}, {"zh-tw": " The TV's on at full volume. One of her sons is fightingwith one of her daughters.", "en": " 只聽見電視機開到最高聲浪。 她的一個兒子正在跟另㚈一個女兒打架。"}, {"zh-tw": " Another son, Ryan, is keeping up thisconstant stream of abuse from the kitchen, and the dogs are lockedbehind the bedroom door and straining. Ella is stuck.", "en": " 另外一個兒子萊恩在廚房傳來一連串的咀咒聲， 狗狗們被鎖在臥室門後，并企圖掙脫。 艾拉不知所措。"}, {"zh-tw": " She has lived with crisis for 40 years. She knows nothing else,and she knows no way out.", "en": " 她在這樣窘境中生活了40年。 她一無所長，也知道沒有出路。"}, {"zh-tw": " She's had a whole seriesof abusive partners, and, tragically, one of her children hasbeen taken into care by social services. The three childrenthat still live with her suffer from a whole range of problems,and none of them are in education.", "en": " 她曾相處過的所有伴侶。無一例外都虐待她。 可悲的是，她其中一個孩子被社會福利機構帶走撫養。 其餘三個孩子仍然跟她同住 受盡種種困苦，沒有一個孩子在上學。"}, {"zh-tw": " And Ella says to me that sheis repeating the cycle of her own mother's life before her.

And the family home was visitedon a regular basis by social workers, youth workers, a health officer,a housing officer, a home tutor and the local policemen.", "en": " 但艾拉等人覺得沒有必要請求社會服務機構 來平息家中的任何一項爭執。 這個家庭以前定時有很多人來探訪， 包括社工丶青年社工丶衛生官員， 家教和當地警員。"}, {"zh-tw": " And the governments saythat there are 100,000 families in Britain today like Ella's, struggling to break the cycle of economic,social and environmental deprivation.

When did you go to school?\" And this kind of interactionrules out the possibility of a normal conversation.", "en": " 湯姆是萊恩的社工。萊恩是艾拉的14歲兒子， 湯姆用他工作的86%時間來服務系統： 跟同事開會，填表格， 又加開會議討論表格的問題， 最恐怖的可能是 他用剩餘的14％時間與萊恩見面的目的 只是為了幫助系統收集訊息。 他問萊恩： \"你多久抽一次菸？你喝酒嗎？ 你什麼時候上學？\" 這樣的交流阻斷了 正常的對話可能性。"}, {"zh-tw": " It rules out the possibilityof what's needed to build a relationshipbetween Tom and Ryan.

And even more radically, the families would lead and they would decide whowas in a best position to help them.", "en": " 於是所有探訪艾拉或是像艾拉一樣家庭的人， 必須用80％的時間服務家庭， 而只有20％替系統工作。 甚至更具突破性的的是， 那些家庭將做為主導， 他們可以決定誰是最適合幫助他們的人。"}, {"zh-tw": " So Ella and another mother were askedto be part of an interview panel, to choose from amongstthe existing professionals who would work with them. And many, many people wanted to join us, because you don't go into this kindof work to manage a system, you go in because you canand you want to make a difference.", "en": " 艾拉跟另一位母親獲邀加入面試小組， 挑選現有的專業人員 將來替她們工作。 其後很多人都想加入我們的隊伍， 因為你不再是為一個系統或機構服務， 你加入是因為你能夠且希望為他們帶來改變。"}, {"zh-tw": " So Ella and the mother askedeverybody who came through the door, \"What will you do when my sonstarts kicking me?\" And so the first person who comes in says, \"Well, I'll look aroundfor the nearest exit and I will back out very slowly, and if the noise is still going on,I'll call my supervisor.\" And the mothers go,\"You're the system. Get out of here!\" And then the next person who comesis a policeman, and he says, \"Well, I'll tackle your son to the groundand then I'm not sure what I'll do.\" And the mothers say, \"Thank you.\" So, they chose professionals who confessed they didn't necessarily have the answers, who said -- well, they weren'tgoing to talk in jargon. They showed their human qualitiesand convinced the mothers that they would stick with themthrough thick and thin, even though they wouldn'tbe soft with them.", "en": " 艾拉和另一個母親問每個進來的人： ＂如果我兒子開始踢我，你會怎麼辦？＂ 第一個進來的人答： ＂噢，我會找最近的出口， 然後慢慢退出去， 如果吵鬧仍然繼續，我會打電話給上司。\" 然後一眾媽媽說：你只是系統，滾出去！ 跟著下一個進來，是一位警員，他說： “我會將你的孩子按在地上，但不確定接下來我會怎麼做。” 兩位母親說：“多謝你。” 於是組員選了一些專業人員。 那些人員坦承自己未必有什麼辦法， 也不會用專業術語跟家庭說話。 他們顯示個人素養，因此母親們深信 這些人不管任何時候都會與他們緊密相連， 即使他們不會溫柔地對待家庭成員。"}, {"zh-tw": " So these new teams and the families were then given a sliverof the former budget, but they could spend the moneyin any way they chose. And so one of the familieswent out for supper.", "en": " 這些新團隊和這些家庭 從以前的經費得來一筆錢， 讓他們可以自由地運用。 其中有一個家庭用來出㚈吃晚飯。"}, {"zh-tw": " They went to McDonald's and they sat downand they talked and they listened for the first time in a long time. Another family asked the team if they would help them do up their home.", "en": " 他們到了麥當勞，很久以來， 第一次坐下來互相傾聽對方説話。 另一個家庭要求團隊 替他們翻新房子。"}, {"zh-tw": " And one mother took the money and she used it as a floatto start a social enterprise. And in a really short space of time, something new started to grow: a relationship between the teamand the workers.", "en": " 還有另一位母親拿經费 用作流動資金開一間社企。 在很短的時間內， 有些新變化萌芽： 團隊跟隊員建立了關係。"}, {"zh-tw": " And then some remarkablechanges took place. Maybe it's not surprising that the journey for Ella has hadsome big steps backwards as well as forwards.", "en": " 跟著有些令人驚訝的變化出現. 或許這並不意外 艾拉的際遇曾有過很大的退步 此外也有進步。"}, {"zh-tw": " But today, she's completedan IT training course, she has her first paid job,her children are back in school, and the neighbors, who previously just hoped this familywould be moved anywhere except next door to them, are fine. They've made some new friendships.", "en": " 但現在她完成了IT培訓課程， 得到一份有薪工作，孩子都上課去。 以前那些 希望艾拉一家搬的 越遠越好的鄰居們。 也變的和睦， 他們產生了新的友誼。"}, {"zh-tw": " And all the same people have beeninvolved in this transformation -- same families, same workers. But the relationship between themhas been supported to change.", "en": " 參與到這場變革中都是同樣的一群人-- 一樣的家庭，一樣的工作人員。 因為彼此的友誼支持他們求變。"}, {"zh-tw": " So I'm telling you about Ellabecause I think that relationships are the critical resource we have in solving some of theseintractable problems. But today, our relationshipsare all but written off by our politics, our social policies,our welfare institutions.", "en": " 我告訴大家艾拉的故事，因為我認為 人際關係是解決這些難題 的重要資源。 但今天我們的人際關係 卻遭政治、社會政策和福利機構毀掉。"}, {"zh-tw": " And I've learned that thisreally has to change. So what do I mean by relationships? I'm talking about the simplehuman bonds between us, a kind of authentic senseof connection, of belonging, the bonds that make us happy,that support us to change, to be brave like Ellaand try something new.", "en": " 所以我知道一定要改變這種情況。 那麼我說的＂關係\"指的是什麼呢？ 指的是人類之間單純的感情紐帶， 一種真實可靠的關聯感、歸屬感， 那種令人快樂的情誼，支撐我們改變, 好像艾拉那般勇敢，勇於嘗試。"}, {"zh-tw": " And, you know, it's no accident that those who run and workin the institutions that are supposed to supportElla and her family don't talk about relationships, because relationships are expresslydesigned out of a welfare model that was drawn up in Britainand exported around the world. The contemporaries of William Beveridge, who was the architectof the first welfare state and the author of the Beveridge Report, had little faith in what they calledthe average sensual or emotional man.", "en": " 所以你知道，那並非偶然 那些管理社福機構的工作人員， 本應支持艾拉和她的家人， 但他們不談人際關係。 因為很明顯地人際關係 被這種起源於英國傳遍世界的福利模式排除在外。 William Beveridge 第一個福利國家的締造者， 也是「Beveridge報告」的作者， 他同時代的人不相信擁有七情六慾的普通人。"}, {"zh-tw": " Instead, they trusted this ideaof the impersonal system and the bureaucrat who would be detachedand work in this system. And the impact of Beveridge on the way the modern statesees social issues just can't be underestimated.", "en": " 轉而相信缺乏人情味的系統， 和為此工作的冷漠官僚。 而受Beveridge影響 現代國家怎樣看待社會問題 是不容低估的。"}, {"zh-tw": " The Beveridge Reportsold over 100,000 copies in the first weeks of publication alone. People queued in the rainon a November night to get hold of a copy, and it was read across the country,across the colonies, across Europe, across the United States of America, and it had this huge impact on the way that welfare stateswere designed around the globe.", "en": " 「Beveridge報告」在出版的第一個星期， 就已賣出十萬本。 人們在一個11月的晚上，冒著雨排隊去賣這本書。 這本書從國內、傳到殖民地、歐洲 和美國。 它大大影響到 全球所有福利國家制訂的福利政策。"}, {"zh-tw": " The cultures, the bureaucracies,the institutions -- they are global, and they've come to seemlike common sense. They've become so ingrained in us, that actually we don't evensee them anymore.", "en": " 它所傳達的文化，官僚主義以及福利機構——傳遍全球， 它們似乎已經成了一種常識。 根深蒂固印在我們的腦袋裡， 雖然我們其實不曾見過它。"}, {"zh-tw": " And I think it's really important to saythat in the 20th century, they were remarkably successful,these institutions. They led to longer lifespans,the eradication of mass disease, mass housing, almost universal education.", "en": " 我們必須鄭重地說在二十世紀年代， 這些福利機構辦得異常地成功。 它們帶來了人均壽命的延長、根除了傳染病、 大量住房，甚至幾乎全民普及的教育。"}, {"zh-tw": " But at the same time, Beveridge sowed the seedsof today's challenges. So let me tell you a second story.", "en": " 但同時間， Beveridge 撒下了今日這些問題的種子。 讓我告訴大家第二個故事。"}, {"zh-tw": " What do you think today is a bigger killerthan a lifetime of smoking? It's loneliness. According to government statistics,one person over 60 -- one in three -- doesn't speak to or seeanother person in a week.", "en": " 你知道比終生吸煙更致命的因素是什麼嗎？ 那是孤獨。 根據政府統計，超過60歳的市民， 每3個人中便有1人整個星期與㚈界隔絕。"}, {"zh-tw": " One person in 10, that's 850,000 people, doesn't speak to anyone else in a month. And we're not the only peoplewith this problem; this problem touches the wholeof the Western world.", "en": " 每10個人中便有一個，也就是有85萬人， 整個月沒有跟別人說過話。 並不是只有我們有這種問題； 整個西方國家普遍都是這樣。"}, {"zh-tw": " And it's even more acutein countries like China, where a process of rapid urbanization,mass migration, has left older people alone in the villages. And so the services that Beveridgedesigned and exported -- they can't address this kind of problem.", "en": " 而且在一些如中國那樣的國家，問題更加嚴重， 因為急速的城鎮化，大量人民遷徙， 留下老人孤獨地在鄉村過活。 Beveridge 設計和傳遍全球的福利服務， 它們無法應付這樣的問題。"}, {"zh-tw": " Loneliness is like a collectiverelational challenge, and it can't be addressedby a traditional bureaucratic response. So some years ago,wanting to understand this problem, I started to work with a groupof about 60 older people in South London, where I live.", "en": " 孤獨就是大眾關係的挑戰， 它無法通過傳統的官僚系統來解決。 數年前，我想了解這個問題， 於是我在居住的倫敦南部， 開始跟一群大約60歲的長者相處。"}, {"zh-tw": " I went shopping, I played bingo, but mainly I was justobserving and listening. I wanted to knowwhat we could do differently.", "en": " 我去購物，玩賓果遊戲， 但主要想觀察和聆聽他們生活的點滴。 我要知道我們該如何改變。"}, {"zh-tw": " And if you ask them, people tell youthey want two things. They want somebody to go up a ladderand change a light bulb, or to be there when theycome out of hospital.", "en": " 如果你問他們，他們會告訴你兩件事。 他們希望有人爬上梯子幫忙換燈泡， 又或者有人去接他們出院。"}, {"zh-tw": " They want on-demand, practical support. And they want to have fun.", "en": " 他們要按個人需要得到實際的支援。 他們想要快樂。"}, {"zh-tw": " They want to go out, do interesting thingswith like-minded people, and make friends like we've allmade friends at every stage of our lives. So we rented a phone line,hired a couple of handymen, and started a service we called \"Circle.\" And Circle offers its local membershipa toll-free 0 800 number that they can call on demandfor any support.", "en": " 他們想要出來跟志同道合的朋友玩樂， 像一般人在每個人生階段結識新朋友。 於是我們租了一條電話線和請了數名雜務員， 展開一項叫\"Circle\"的服務。 這項服務提供本地會員免費電話號碼0800 他們有任何需求都可以立即打來。"}, {"zh-tw": " And people have called usfor so many reasons. They've called becausetheir pets are unwell, their DVD is broken, they've forgottenhow to use their mobile phone, or maybe they are coming out of hospital and they want someone to be there.", "en": " 他們因為無數理由打來。 有的是寵物不舒服， 有的是DVD 壞了，有的是忘了怎樣使用手提電話； 又或者正要出院 希望有人在去接他。"}, {"zh-tw": " And Circle also offersa rich social calendar -- knitting, darts, museum tours,hot air ballooning -- you name it. But here's the interesting thing,the really deep change: over time, the friendshipsthat have formed have begun to replace the practical offer.", "en": " ＂Circle\"還安排了豐富的社交活動-- 編織、擲飛標，參觀博物館、玩熱氣球--你想到的都有。 最有趣的是他們生活有徹底的變化： 經過一段時間，真正的友誼 已經建立，代替了實際的服務。"}, {"zh-tw": " So let me tell you about Belinda. Belinda's a Circle member, and she wasgoing into hospital for a hip operation, so she called her local Circle to saythey wouldn't see her for a bit.", "en": " 讓我告訴你貝琳達的故事。 她是\"Circle\"的會員，正要入院做關節手術， 她打電話告訴當地的\"Circle\"她會離開一陣子。"}, {"zh-tw": " And Damon, who runs the local Circle,calls her back and says, \"How can I help?\" And Belinda says, \"Oh no, I'm fine -- Jocelyn is doing the shopping,Tony's doing the gardening, Melissa and Joe are goingto come in and cook and chat.\" So five Circle membershad organized themselves to take care of Belinda. And Belinda's 80, although she saysthat she feels 25 inside, but she also says that she felt stuck and pretty downwhen she joined Circle.", "en": " 戴蒙是那 貝琳達 説：啊，沒什麼問題-- 喬斯林負責購物，托尼打理花草， 梅麗莎 和 喬會過來聊天和煮飯。\" 5個組員自行分配工作 去照顧貝琳達。 雖然貝琳達已經80歲，她感覺自己只有25歲。 但她也説 最初加入＂Circle\"時，生活困難，心情很壞。"}, {"zh-tw": " But the simple act of encouraging herto come along to that first event led to a process wherenatural friendships formed, friendships that today are replacingthe need for expensive services. It's relationshipsthat are making the difference.", "en": " 但是會員的小小鼓勵，讓她參加第一次活動， 在那裡很自然地結識新朋友， 現在友情已經替代了那些她需要的昂貴服務。 這是人際關係帶來改變。"}, {"zh-tw": " So I think that three factorshave converged that enable us to put relationshipsat the heart and center of how we solve social problems today. Firstly, the nature of the problems -- they've changed, and they requiredifferent solutions.", "en": " 我認為有3個因素匯聚一起 才能讓我們把人際關係用為核心 用來解決今日的社會問題。 第一是問題的本質-- 它們變化無常，需要多種多樣的解決方法。"}, {"zh-tw": " Secondly, the cost, human as muchas financial, of doing business as usual. And thirdly, technology.", "en": " 第二是經費，就像普通做生意的那樣，經費越多人手越多。 第三是科技"}, {"zh-tw": " I've talked about the first two factors. It's technology that enablesthese approaches to scale and potentially now supportthousands of people.", "en": " 我已談論了首兩個因素。 因為科技，所以這個方式能夠發揮到極致， 足以服務現在數以千計的人仕。"}, {"zh-tw": " So the technology we've usedis really simple, it's made up of available thingslike databases, mobile phones. Circle has got this very simplesystem that underpins it, enables a small local team to supporta membership of up to a thousand.", "en": " 我們採用的科技很簡單， 只是由現有的東西組成，例如數據庫和手機。 正因為\"Circle\"有一個非常簡單的系統支援， 才使得當地的小組可以為上千名會員提供服務。"}, {"zh-tw": " And you can contrast thiswith a neighborhood organization of the 1970s, when this kind of scalejust wasn't possible, neither was the quality or the longevitythat the spine of technology can provide. So it's relationshipsunderpinned by technology that can turn the Beveridgemodels on their heads.", "en": " 你可以把它和70年代的鄰里組織 相比較， 這種規模的服務在當時是不可能的， 更遑論以科技為支柱讓它變得更優質和長久。 所以科技可以鞏固人際關係， 完全改變Beveridge 的模式。"}, {"zh-tw": " The Beveridge models are allabout institutions with finite resources, anonymously managing access. In my work at the front line, I've seen again and again howup to 80 percent of resource is spent keeping people out.", "en": " Beveridge 模式是關於利用有限資源的社福機構， 不具名的管理和投入。 我在前缐工作時， 見到多至80%的資源用在 不停用來把人們拒之門㚈。"}, {"zh-tw": " So professionals have to administer these increasingly complex formsof administration that are basically about stopping peopleaccessing the service or managing the queue. And Circle, like the relational servicesthat we and others have designed, inverts this logic.", "en": " 專業人員必須要處理 那些日益複雜的行政表格， 其實是用來阻止人們獲取服務 或者管理申請的輪候隊伍。 所以我們設計了Circle這種感情化的服務， 去顛倒這種邏輯。"}, {"zh-tw": " What it says is, the more people,the more relationships, the stronger the solution. So I want to tell you my thirdand final story, which is about unemployment.", "en": " 它的宗旨是越多人參與，所建立起的關係就越廣泛， 解決辦法越強。 我想告訴大家第三，也是最後的故事， 它與失業有關。"}, {"zh-tw": " In Britain, as in most placesin the world, our welfare states were primarily designed to get people into work, to educate them for this, and to keep them healthy. But here, too, the systems are failing.", "en": " 英國像世界上大部分地方一樣， 制訂國家福利的宗旨 是要人們就業， 讓他們為此受教育， 讓他們身體保持健康。 但福利制度，在這些方面也同樣失效了。"}, {"zh-tw": " And so the response has been to try and make these old systemseven more efficient and transactional -- to speed up processing times, dividepeople into ever-smaller categories, try and target services at themmore efficiently -- in other words, the very opposite of relational. But guess how most people find work today? Through word of mouth.", "en": " 而政府的反應只是想把舊有制度 變得更有效率和交易化， 加快處理時間，把申請人歸入更小的類別， 更有效率地為市民提供適合的服務， 換言之，它走到了人際關係的對立面。 但猜猜今日大多數人怎樣找工作呢？ 那是經口耳相傳的方法。"}, {"zh-tw": " It turns out that in Britain today,most new jobs are not advertised. So it's friends that tell you about a job, it's friends that recommend you for a job, and it's a rich and diverse social networkthat helps you find work.", "en": " 最後發現今日的英國，大部分的新工作並不賣廣告。 全靠朋友告訴你有新工作。 全靠朋友介紹你去見工。 那是多元和豐富的社會網絡幫你找工作。"}, {"zh-tw": " Maybe some of you herethis evening are thinking, \"But I found my job through an advert,\" but if you think back, it was probablya friend that showed you the ad and then encouraged you to apply. But not surprisingly, people who perhaps most needthis rich and diverse network are those who are most isolated from it.", "en": " 或許你們其中有些人今晚會想， ＂可是我因為看廣告，才找到這份工。＂ 但若你回想起來，可能也是朋友讓你看到那個廣告， 跟著鼓勵你去申請。 毫無意外地， 那些最需要豐富多元的人脈的人， 恰恰是那些被孤立的隔絕者。"}, {"zh-tw": " So knowing this, and also knowing about the costsand failure of current systems, we designed something newwith relationships at its heart. We designed a servicethat encourages people to meet up, people in and out of work, to work together in structured ways and try new opportunities.", "en": " 知道這個原因以後， 也知道現時制度失敗和消耗的經費， 我們制以人際關係為重點訂了新一套新方案。 設計了一種鼓勵人們聚在一起的服務， 無論人們失業和就業， 都有組織地合作 和找新機會。"}, {"zh-tw": " And, well, it's very hard to comparethe results of these new systems with the old transactional models, but it looks like,with our first 1,000 members, we outperformed existing servicesby a factor of three, at a fraction of the cost. And here, too, we've used technology, but not to network people in the waythat a social platform would do.", "en": " 這類新制度得來的成果跟舊制的貿易化模式 這是很難作比較， 看上去我們首個有著1千名會員的小組， 比已存在系統要高效兩倍 卻只花費了一小部分的經費。 而且我們也運用科技， 但不會像社交平台在網絡連繫。"}, {"zh-tw": " We've used it to bring people face to faceand connect them with each other, building real relationshipsand supporting people to find work. At the end of his life, in 1948, Beveridge wrote a third report.", "en": " 而是利用科技讓人們會面的聯絡， 建立真正的關係，幫忙會員找工作。 1948年，Beveridge 到了他生命的盡頭， 他寫了第三份報告。"}, {"zh-tw": " And in it he said he had madea dreadful mistake.
