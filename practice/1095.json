We see light reflected off the Moon.", "en": " 太陽照亮我們的視野邊界 因為光的反射而看見月亮"}, {"zh-tw": " And in the time since Galileo pointed that rudimentary telescope at the celestial bodies, the known universe has come to us through light, across vast eras in cosmic history. And with all of our modern telescopes, we've been able to collect this stunning silent movie of the universe -- these series of snapshots that go all the way back to the Big Bang.", "en": " 自從伽利略以最原始的望遠鏡 舉目望天開始了觀測 一向以來，已知宇宙都是透過光來向我們傳達訊息 即便穿越了宇宙浩瀚的歷史 以現代的望遠鏡 我們能接收 這齣令人驚異、讚歎的宇宙無聲電影 用許多連續圖形 一路回溯至大霹靂時期"}, {"zh-tw": " And yet, the universe is not a silent movie because the universe isn't silent. I'd like to convince you that the universe has a soundtrack and that soundtrack is played on space itself, because space can wobble like a drum.", "en": " 但是，宇宙上演的並不是一齣默劇 因為宇宙其實並非一片死寂 我想說服你們的就是這件事 宇宙是個有聲電影 宇宙自己發出聲音成為它的聲部 這是因為太空像鼓一樣會震動"}, {"zh-tw": " It can ring out a kind of recording throughout the universe of some of the most dramatic events as they unfold. Now we'd like to be able to add to a kind of glorious visual composition that we have of the universe -- a sonic composition.", "en": " 它像唱片一樣可以發出聲音 傳遍整個宇宙 尤其當某些極富戲劇效果的事件展開的時候 現在我們想嘗試 在炫麗奪目的視覺效果以外 為我們的宇宙再加上 它聲音的部份"}, {"zh-tw": " And while we've never heard the sounds from space, we really should, in the next few years, start to turn up the volume on what's going on out there. So in this ambition to capture songs from the universe, we turn our focus to black holes and the promise they have, because black holes can bang on space-time like mallets on a drum and have a very characteristic song, which I'd like to play for you -- some of our predictions for what that song will be like.", "en": " 雖然我們從沒聽過來自太空的聲音 幾年之內，我們應該可以開始 把外面世界發出的聲音音量再調更大 在這雄心壯志 企圖接收宇宙譜出的歌曲驅動下 帶領我們將目光轉向 黑洞和它們的能量特性 因為黑洞能在空-時中發出聲響 像一根鼓棒一樣 它的歌曲則極富特色 在此根據我們的假設 將要播放一段黑洞可能會發出的聲音"}, {"zh-tw": " Now black holes are dark against a dark sky. We can't see them directly.", "en": " 黑洞是襯在黑底之上 不可能直接看得見"}, {"zh-tw": " They're not brought to us with light, at least not directly.

Now we owe the idea that space can ring like a drum to Albert Einstein -- to whom we owe so much.", "en": " 但黑洞是可以聽得見的 就算它們真的是我們所不能看見的 能聽見黑洞是因它像鼓一樣,敲槌著空時 我們會有這麼一個太空中響著鼓聲的念頭 最該感謝的人是愛因斯坦，非常感謝"}, {"zh-tw": " Einstein realized that if space were empty, if the universe were empty, it would be like this picture, except for maybe without the helpful grid drawn on it.

It was Einstein's great general theory of relativity.", "en": " 愛因斯坦還想到另一件事 而那個部份才是更加精采 也就是，若將能量或質量放在宇宙中 它會彎曲空間 而自由落下的物體 有可能會經過，譬如說，太陽 於是它的路徑會受偏轉 沿著空間自然曲線偏轉 這是愛因斯坦的普通相對論"}, {"zh-tw": " Now even light will be bent by those paths. And you can be bent so much that you're caught in orbit around the Sun, as the Earth is, or the Moon around the Earth.", "en": " 因為連光都會受這些路徑影響而彎曲 彎曲到一個程度 你會被太陽抓住而繞著它依軌道運轉 就像地球繞太陽轉，月亮繞地球轉"}, {"zh-tw": " These are the natural curves in space. What Einstein did not realize was that, if you took our Sun and you crushed it down to six kilometers -- so you took a million times the mass of the Earth and you crushed it to six kilometers across, you would make a black hole, an object so dense that if light veered too close, it would never escape -- a dark shadow against the universe.", "en": " 這就是空間的自然曲線 愛因斯坦沒想通的事情是 如果你拿著太陽 把它擠壓直到只剩6公里直徑大小 這是一團質量是地球100萬倍的東西 然後把它的體積壓縮到6公里寬 這樣就是個黑洞 一個非常嚴密的物質 如果靠得太近，連光不可能逃走 成為一個相對於宇宙的黑色陰影"}, {"zh-tw": " It wasn't Einstein who realized this, it was Karl Schwarzschild who was a German Jew in World War I -- joined the German army already an accomplished scientist, working on the Russian front. I like to imagine Schwarzschild in the war in the trenches calculating ballistic trajectories for cannon fire, and then, in between, calculating Einstein's equations -- as you do in the trenches.", "en": " 愛因斯坦沒領悟到這件事情 這是卡爾史瓦西解出來的 他是德國猶太人，在第一次世界大戰時 在入伍時已是一位傑出科學家 在德俄邊境前線工作 我總愛想像史瓦西是躲在戰爭時期的壕溝裡頭 邊計算高射炮的發射彈道 邊偶爾計算一下 愛因斯坦的公式 壕溝裡能做的事情不多"}, {"zh-tw": " And he was reading Einstein's recently published general theory of relativity, and he was thrilled by this theory. And he quickly surmised an exact mathematical solution that described something very extraordinary: curves so strong that space would rain down into them, space itself would curve like a waterfall flowing down the throat of a hole.", "en": " 他正拜讀愛因斯坦最新的 普通相對論 令他大感驚訝的理論 他很快推算出 一道精確的數學解答 極不尋常的描述了一個現象 一道強大的曲線 空間會順勢下流 空間本身會像瀑布一般的彎曲 向下流入一個喉嚨敞開的洞"}, {"zh-tw": " And even light could not escape this current. Light would be dragged down the hole as everything else would be, and all that would be left would be a shadow.", "en": " 即便是光也無法逃離這股流勢 光會被拉入這個洞中 和其他任何東西一樣 所有東西最後都會只剩下一個影子"}, {"zh-tw": " Now he wrote to Einstein, and he said, \"As you will see, the war has been kind to me enough. Despite the heavy gunfire, I've been able to get away from it all and walk through the land of your ideas.\" And Einstein was very impressed with his exact solution, and I should hope also the dedication of the scientist.", "en": " 史瓦西寫信告訴愛因斯坦 他說,「且看, 戰爭對我是多麼慷慨有餘啊, 即便在戰火交織下 我也能有遠離這一切的一個某處可去 一步步前進在由你的理論所佔領的土地上。」 愛因斯坦對史瓦西精確的解答實在印象深刻 我應該期望自己有科學家這樣全心全力"}, {"zh-tw": " This is the hardworking scientist under harsh conditions. And he took Schwarzschild's idea to the Prussian Academy of Sciences the next week.", "en": " 在這樣艱困的處境下仍辛勤工作 帶著著史瓦西的理論想法 一週後，愛因斯坦前往波斯科學院"}, {"zh-tw": " But Einstein always thought black holes were a mathematical oddity. He did not believe they existed in nature.", "en": " 愛因斯坦一向以為黑洞只不過是個純數學的怪物 他並不相信自然界真有這個東西存在"}, {"zh-tw": " He thought nature would protect us from their formation. It was decades before the term \"black hole\" was coined and people realized that black holes are real astrophysical objects -- in fact they're the death state of very massive stars that collapse catastrophically at the end of their lifetime.", "en": " 他認為自然界應該會在創生的過程中保護我們 幾十年過去 黑洞一詞被憑空創造問世 人們理解到 黑洞是天文物理中真實的天體 事實上它們是一種最終的境界 大質量恆星們的最終結局 災難性的崩塌瓦解 當它的生命走到盡頭時"}, {"zh-tw": " Now our Sun will not collapse to a black hole. It's actually not massive enough.", "en": " 我們的太陽不會塌縮成黑洞 事實上它的質量還不夠形成為黑洞"}, {"zh-tw": " But if we did a little thought experiment -- as Einstein was very fond of doing -- we could imagine putting the Sun crushed down to six kilometers, and putting a tiny little Earth around it in orbit, maybe 30 kilometers outside of the black-hole sun. And it would be self-illuminated, because now the Sun's gone, we have no other source of light -- so let's make our little Earth self-illuminated.", "en": " 但如果我們運用思考來做個實驗 就像愛因斯坦很喜歡做的事情一樣 我們不妨想像 把太陽壓縮成６公里大小 把一個超微小地球放在它旁邊依軌道運行 距離約30公里 在這顆太陽黑洞外面30公里處 然後地球自己會發光 因為沒有太陽了,我們也將失去光源-- 只好先假設地球變成是發光體的情形"}, {"zh-tw": " And you would realize you could put the Earth in a happy orbit even 30 km outside of this crushed black hole. This crushed black hole actually would fit inside Manhattan, more or less.", "en": " 你會發現這個距離之下地球軌道 在距離黑洞 30公里以外 一個被壓縮的黑洞 事實上就和紐約市中心的曼哈頓區差不多大而已"}, {"zh-tw": " It might spill off into the Hudson a little bit before it destroyed the Earth. But basically that's what we're talking about.", "en": " 有時它或許會碰到一點哈得遜區 在它快要吞滅地球之前 基本上我們說的就是體積這麼小的一個東西"}, {"zh-tw": " We're talking about an object that you could crush down to half the square area of Manhattan. So we move this Earth very close -- 30 kilometers outside -- and we notice it's perfectly fine orbiting around the black hole.", "en": " 我們說的這個東西是你可以把它壓縮到 只有曼哈頓方圓一半大的區域 我們把這個地球移動到非常靠近 -- 30公里外的這個距離 這是繞行這顆黑洞完美的軌道"}, {"zh-tw": " There's a sort of myth that black holes devour everything in the universe, but you actually have to get very close to fall in. But what's very impressive is that, from our vantage point, we can always see the Earth.", "en": " 這有點神秘 黑洞無一例外的吞滅宇宙裡的一切物體 但事實上你必須非常靠近它才能掉的下去 但令人驚訝的是,從我們的觀望點 我們總是看得到地球"}, {"zh-tw": " It cannot hide behind the black hole. The light from the Earth, some of it falls in, but some of it gets lensed around and brought back to us.", "en": " 它沒辦法躲藏在黑洞的後方 這時有些從地球發出的光會掉入黑洞中 有些會因受到透鏡得作用,傳回來讓我們看見"}, {"zh-tw": " So you can't hide anything behind a black hole. If this were Battlestar Galactica and you're fighting the Cylons, don't hide behind the black hole.", "en": " 你沒辦法把一樣東西藏在黑洞後面 如果是在科幻影集「太空堡壘」中 你和塞隆人正在作戰 千萬別選在一個黑洞的後面跟他玩躲迷藏"}, {"zh-tw": " They can see you. Now, our Sun will not collapse to a black hole -- it's not massive enough -- but there are tens of thousands of black holes in our galaxy.", "en": " 敵人一定會看見你 太陽不會塌縮成黑洞 它質量不夠 我們的銀河系裡有上萬顆黑洞"}, {"zh-tw": " And if one were to eclipse the Milky Way, this is what it would look like. We would see a shadow of that black hole against the hundred billion stars in the Milky Way Galaxy and its luminous dust lanes.", "en": " 如果銀河系裡發生了「食」的現象 看起來會像這樣 我們會看到一個黑洞的影子 在數千億顆明亮恆星的映襯之下 在銀河系還有許多明亮的塵埃帶中"}, {"zh-tw": " And if we were to fall towards this black hole, we would see all of that light lensed around it, and we could even start to cross into that shadow and really not notice that anything dramatic had happened. It would be bad if we tried to fire our rockets and get out of there because we couldn't, anymore than light can escape.", "en": " 若我們朝黑洞裡頭掉進去 我們會看見受到透鏡作用的光環繞在外層 我們甚至開始穿透那個陰影 卻並不會真的發現什麼太有戲劇效果的事情 試圖從黑洞裡發射一顆火箭逃出來並不是個太好的主意 因為根本不可行 連光都逃不掉"}, {"zh-tw": " But even though the black hole is dark from the outside, it's not dark on the inside, because all of the light from the galaxy can fall in behind us. And even though, due to a relativistic effect known as time dilation, our clocks would seem to slow down relative to galactic time, it would look as though the evolution of the galaxy had been sped up and shot at us, right before we were crushed to death by the black hole.", "en": " 不過雖然黑洞從外面看是漆黑一片 內層卻不是黑的 因為所有銀河系而來的光都在我們身後掉進來 儘管如此,由於時間膨脹的相對關係 我們的時鐘會慢下來 相對於星系時間 看起來會好像是銀河系的演化 加速度進行並且正對著我們而來 然後我們將被黑洞壓碎而死掉"}, {"zh-tw": " It would be like a near-death experience where you see the light at the end of the tunnel, but it's a total death experience.

If you were standing near enough, your ear would resonate with the squeezing and stretching of space.", "en": " 使太空發出聲響 它們從黑洞裡以光速跑出來 震盪並聯合 合成為一個波,安靜的黑洞 在喧囂後重歸寧靜 倘若你站的距離夠近 耳中會回響著 空間擠壓和伸展的聲音"}, {"zh-tw": " You would literally hear the sound. Now of course, your head would be squeezed and stretched unhelpfully, so you might have trouble understanding what's going on.", "en": " 你會真的聽得見聲音 當然你的頭也會被壓縮拉長,這是無可避免的 所以其實你也根本搞不清楚現在是什麼情況"}, {"zh-tw": " But I'd like to play for you the sound that we predict. This is from my group -- a slightly less glamorous computer modeling.", "en": " 不過我想播一段這個給你聽 這是我們預測中的聲音 從我的團隊而來的數據 我們的電腦計算模型看起來比較沒那麼炫"}, {"zh-tw": " Imagine a lighter black hole falling into a very heavy black hole. The sound you're hearing is the light black hole banging on space each time it gets close.", "en": " 想像一個質量較輕的小黑洞 掉進了質量很大的黑洞 你聽見的聲音 是小黑洞敲擊著太空 每一次的聲音都代表更加靠近"}, {"zh-tw": " If it gets far away, it's a little too quiet. But it comes in like a mallet, and it literally cracks space, wobbling it like a drum.", "en": " 越遠會越安靜 但它像是個木槌 而且實際上它真的是在敲打著空間 像鼓一樣的震動"}, {"zh-tw": " And we can predict what the sound will be. We know that, as it falls in, it gets faster and it gets louder.", "en": " 我們可以預估這個聲音像是什麼 我們知道,因為它掉進來 它愈來愈快也愈來愈大聲"}, {"zh-tw": " And eventually, we're going to hear the little guy just fall into the bigger guy. (Thumping) Then it's gone.", "en": " 最後 我們聽見小黑洞掉進大黑洞裡 (砰砰重擊聲) 然後它消失"}, {"zh-tw": " Now I've never heard it that loud -- it's actually more dramatic. At home it sounds kind of anticlimactic.", "en": " 我從來沒聽過這麼大聲的版本 -- 這樣更富戲劇效果 在家裡頭聽它比較像是漸漸沒力"}, {"zh-tw": " It's sort of like ding, ding, ding. This is another sound from my group.", "en": " 聽起來只有叮,叮,叮而已 這裡還有另一個我的團隊所模擬的聲音"}, {"zh-tw": " No, I'm not showing you any images, because black holes don't leave behind helpful trails of ink, and space is not painted, showing you the curves.

I mean we have to ask, has it happened before? Will it happen again? I mean, in the spirit of rising to TED's challenge to reignite wonder, we can ask questions, at least for this last minute, that honestly might evade us forever. But we have to ask: Is it possible that our universe is just a plume off of some greater history? Or, is it possible that we're just a branch off of a multiverse -- each branch with its own Big Bang in its past -- maybe some of them with black holes playing drums, maybe some without -- maybe some with sentient life, and maybe some without -- not in our past, not in our future, but somehow fundamentally connected to us? So we have to wonder, if there is a multiverse, in some other patch of that multiverse, are there creatures? Here's my multiverse creatures.", "en": " 如果宇宙電影可以倒著播 我們知道過去曾有一個大霹靂 我們甚至聽得見這個不和諧的聲音 究竟這個大霹靂是唯一的大霹靂嗎? 我們必須要問,還是它以前也曾發生過? 還會再發生嗎? 依循TED的精神宗旨及挑戰 我們要將「好奇心重新點燃」 所以要在最後不多的時間裡問 我們永遠都在逃避 但又不得不問的問題 有無可能我們的宇宙,在時間上 只不過是一棵歷史大樹上小小的枝枒? 又或者,我們該不會是多元宇宙的一小部份而已 -- 而每個小部份都來自一個大霹靂的過去 -- 也許其中有些有黑洞在敲著鼓聲 有些沒有 -- 有些是具有敏銳感覺,有些沒有 不在過去,不在未來 但奇妙的卻和我們在基本上相扣相連? 所以我們必須設想,如果有多元宇宙 在那個宇宙的某一方塊 會有生物嗎? 來自平行宇宙的生物就在這邊..."}, {"zh-tw": " Are there other creatures in the multiverse, wondering about us and wondering about their own origins? And if they are, I can imagine them as we are, calculating, writing computer code, building instruments, trying to detect that faintest sound of their origins and wondering who else is out there.
