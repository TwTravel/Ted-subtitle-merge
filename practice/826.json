Okay, we're naive, we're bright-eyed and bushy-tailed.", "en": " 從事我們這一行的 都相信照片可以改變世界 好吧，我們是很天真，而且還不知天高地厚"}, {"zh-tw": " The truth is that we know that the images themselves don't change the world, but we're also aware that, since the beginning of photography, images have provoked reactions in people, and those reactions have caused change to happen. So let's begin with a group of images.", "en": " 事實上我們知道 照片本身並不會改變世界 我們也瞭解，自從攝影問世以來 照片開始對人們產生影響 而且促使人們採取行動去改變世界 那麼我們先來看一些照片"}, {"zh-tw": " I'd be extremely surprised if you didn't recognize many or most of them. They're best described as iconic: so iconic, perhaps, they're cliches.", "en": " 我覺得你們應該都看過這些照片 至少認得其中幾張 這些都是經典的照片 相當經典，或許有人覺得己經過時了"}, {"zh-tw": " In fact, they're so well-known that you might even recognize them in a slightly or somewhat different form. But I think we're looking for something more.", "en": " 事實上，這些經典照片 就算有些小小的改變 你還是會認得出來 但我想談的不只這些照片"}, {"zh-tw": " We're looking for something more. We're looking for images that shine an uncompromising light on crucial issues, images that transcend borders, that transcend religions, images that provoke us to step up and do something -- in other words, to act.", "en": " 還有一些別的東西 我想要談的是在關鍵時刻 發出堅定光芒的照片 超越國界的照片、超越宗教的照片 那些促使我們 挺身而出 採取行動的照片"}, {"zh-tw": " Well, this image you've all seen. It changed our view of the physical world.", "en": " 嗯，你們一定看過這張照片 它改變了我們觀看世界的角度"}, {"zh-tw": " We had never seen our planet from this perspective before. Many people credit a lot of the birth of the environmental movement to our seeing the planet like this for the first time -- its smallness, its fragility.", "en": " 我們以前從來沒有從這個角度看過自己的星球 許多人相信 現在的環保運動之所以會興起 是因為這張照片 因為我們第一次 看到地球的渺小與脆弱"}, {"zh-tw": " Forty years later, this group, more than most, are well aware of the destructive power that our species can wield over our environment. And at last, we appear to be doing something about it.", "en": " 40年之後，這些環保團體開始注意到 人類對於自身的環境 具有毁滅性的破壞力 所以，我們開始對此採取一些行動"}, {"zh-tw": " This destructive power takes many different forms. For example, these images taken by Brent Stirton in the Congo.", "en": " 這些毁滅性的破壞力具有不同的面貌 例如，Brent Stirton在剛果 所拍攝的這些照片"}, {"zh-tw": " These gorillas were murdered, some would even say crucified, and unsurprisingly, they sparked international outrage. Most recently, we've been tragically reminded of the destructive power of nature itself with the recent earthquake in Haiti.", "en": " 這些大猩猩被人類殘殺，有人覺得他們像是被釘在十字架上 當然 這些照片引起了國際憤怒 最近 我們目睹大自然所帶來毁滅性的破壞力 在海地地震中所造成的悲劇"}, {"zh-tw": " Well, I think what is far worse is man's destructive power over man. Samuel Pisar, an Auschwitz survivor, said, and I'll quote him, \"The Holocaust teaches us that nature, even in its cruelest moments, is benign in comparison with man, when he loses his moral compass and his reason.\" There's another kind of crucifixion.", "en": " 我則認為 這和人類自相殘殺所造成的悲劇比起來，算不上什麼 Samuel Pisar是奧許維茲集中營的倖存者 我引用他說的話 納粹對猶太人的屠殺讓我們瞭解到 一旦人類喪失自己的道德準則和行為正義 就算和最殘暴的大自然相比 大自然都還算仁慈的多 人類還有其他的暴行"}, {"zh-tw": " The horrifying images from Abu Ghraib as well as the images from Guantanamo had a profound impact. The publication of those images, as opposed to the images themselves, caused a government to change its policies.", "en": " 伊拉克美軍虐囚案 及關達納摩監獄裡令人震驚的照片 都對世人產生深遠的影響 相較於這些照片本身 這些照片公諸於世 讓政府改變政策"}, {"zh-tw": " Some would argue that it is those images that did more to fuel the insurgency in Iraq than virtually any other single act. Furthermore, those images forever removed the so-called moral high ground of the occupying forces.", "en": " 但是有人卻認為這些照片 反而助長了伊拉克的暴動 是其他的具體行動無法相比 還有人認為這些照片 摧毁了駐地美軍自以為是的高道德觀"}, {"zh-tw": " Let's go back a little. In the 1960s and 1970s, the Vietnam War was basically shown in America's living rooms day in, day out.", "en": " 讓我們回顧歷史 在1960到1970年之間 越戰的畫面基本上充斥於 每天的電視新聞"}, {"zh-tw": " News photos brought people face to face with the victims of the war: a little girl burned by napalm, a student killed by the National Guard at Kent State University in Ohio during a protest. In fact, these images became the voices of protest themselves.", "en": " 新聞迫使每個人去面對 戰爭中的受害者，一個小女孩被汽油彈燒傷 一個在俄亥俄州Kent州立大學就讀的大學生 因為參與抗議而被鎮暴部隊殺害 這些照片反而成為 最有力的抗議聲音"}, {"zh-tw": " Now, images have power to shed light of understanding on suspicion, ignorance, and in particular -- I've given a lot of talks on this but I'll just show one image -- the issue of HIV/AIDS. In the 1980s, the stigmatization of people with the disease was an enormous barrier to even discussing or addressing it.", "en": " 某些照片 甚至會散發出光芒 讓我們在猜疑與忽視中產生同理心 尤其是針對愛滋病的議題 我曾針對這個議題發表過許多演說 但我只打算讓你們看這張照片 在1980年代人們對愛滋病污名化 造成大部分的人 都不願意討論或提及這個問題"}, {"zh-tw": " A simple act, in 1987, of the most famous woman in the world, the Princess of Wales, touching an HIV/AIDS infected baby did a great deal, especially in Europe, to stop that. She, better than most, knew the power of an image.", "en": " 然而在1987年，世界上最有名的一位女士，她做了一個簡單的動作 黛安娜王妃 抱起染上愛滋病的嬰孩 就讓大部分的人接納了愛滋病，尤其是歐洲人 她比任何人都瞭解影像的力量"}, {"zh-tw": " So when we are confronted by a powerful image, we all have a choice: We can look away, or we can address the image. Thankfully, when these photos appeared in The Guardian in 1998, they put a lot of focus and attention and, in the end, a lot of money towards the Sudan famine relief efforts.", "en": " 當我們面對一張具有影響力的照片時 我們可以有所選擇 我們可以假裝沒看到，或是我們可以讓這張照片曝光 很慶幸的，當這些照片 在1998年刊載於英國衛報 世人開始注意這個問題，開始投入大量金錢 援助蘇丹的饑荒難民"}, {"zh-tw": " Did the images change the world? No, but they had a major impact. Images often push us to question our core beliefs and our responsibilities to each other.", "en": " 這些照片是否改變了世界？ 不是，但是他們具有極大的影響力 照片通常會讓我們質疑自己的中心信念 以及我們對世界的責任"}, {"zh-tw": " We all saw those images after Katrina, and I think for millions of people they had a very strong impact. And I think it's very unlikely that they were far from the minds of Americans when they went to vote in November 2008.", "en": " 我們都看過卡崔娜颶風災後的照片 而且我相信看過照片的千百萬民眾 內心都有強烈的衝擊 我深刻認為 全美民眾的心是一致的 尤其是他們在2008年十一月前往投票的時候"}, {"zh-tw": " Unfortunately, some very important images are deemed too graphic or disturbing for us to see them. I'll show you one photo here, and it's a photo by Eugene Richards of an Iraq War veteran from an extraordinary piece of work, which has never been published, called War Is Personal.", "en": " 很不幸的，有些非常重要的照片 由於太過寫實而不忍足睹 請看看這張照片 Eugene Richards為一位伊拉克戰爭退伍士兵 所拍攝的卓越照片 從未對外公開，命名為“我一個人的戰爭”"}, {"zh-tw": " But images don't need to be graphic in order to remind us of the tragedy of war. John Moore set up this photo at Arlington Cemetery.", "en": " 照片並不一定要如此寫實 才能喚起我們注意到戰爭的悲慘 John Moore在阿靈頓公墓拍攝了這張照片"}, {"zh-tw": " After all the tense moments of conflict in all the conflict zones of the world, there's one photograph from a much quieter place that haunts me still, much more than the others. Ansel Adams said, and I'm going to disagree with him, \"You don't take a photograph, you make it.\" In my view, it's not the photographer who makes the photo, it's you.", "en": " 在所有緊張對峙和衝突之後 在世界上所有爆發戰爭區域 有一張來自寂靜角落的照片 一直縈繞在我心頭 Ansel Adams曾說過，但我並不贊同 你不是在拍攝照片，你是在創造照片 在我看來，照片並不是由攝影師創造 而是由你們創造"}, {"zh-tw": " We bring to each image our own values, our own belief systems, and as a result of that, the image resonates with us. My company has 70 million images.", "en": " 我們為每一張照片 賦予我們自己的價值觀、我們自己的信念 因此，我們拍攝的照片將反映出自己的想法 我的公司裡有七千萬張照片"}, {"zh-tw": " I have one image in my office. Here it is.", "en": " 我放了一張在我的辦公室 就是這張"}, {"zh-tw": " I hope that the next time you see an image that sparks something in you, you'll better understand why, and I know that speaking to this audience, you'll definitely do something about it. And thank you to all the photographers.", "en": " 我希望下次你們在看 某張能引發你思考的照片時 你會瞭解其中的原因 而且我知道，在聽了我的演說之後 你們將會有所行動 我要謝謝所有的攝影師"}], "title": "Jonathan Klein Photos That Changed The World"}
