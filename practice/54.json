To explain the wish, I'm goingto have to take you somewhere where many people haven't been,and that's around the world. When I was about 24 years old, Kate Stohrand myself started an organization to get architects and designersinvolved in humanitarian work, not only about respondingto natural disasters, but involved in systemic issues.", "en": " 我將帶大家踏上一段旅程 為了解釋這個願望，我將不得不把你們帶到 世界各地很多人都沒有到過的地方 當我24歲左右的時候，我和凱特‧史代開始了一個組織 來帶動建築師和設計師參與人道主義的工作 不僅僅涉及應對自然災害 還包括系統性的問題"}, {"zh-tw": " We believe that where the resourcesand expertise are scarce, innovative, sustainable design can reallymake a difference in people's lives. So I started my life as an architect,or training as an architect, and I was always interestedin socially responsible design, and how you can really make an impact.", "en": " 我們相信在資源和專業知識匱乏的地方 創新、可持續的設計才能夠真正地改善人們的生活 因此，這一切都要從我的 -- 我最初是一名建築師，或培訓作為一個建築師 我一直對社會認真負責的設計 以及你們怎樣能夠真正產生影響感到興趣"}, {"zh-tw": " But when I went to architecture school, it seemed that I wasa black sheep in the family. Many architects seemed to thinkthat when you design, you design a jewel, and it's a jewelthat you try and crave for; whereas I felt that when you design, you either improveor you create a detriment to the communityin which you're designing.", "en": " 但當我在建築學校念書的時候 我彷佛是當中的害群之馬 許多建築師似乎認為，當你設計的時候 你是在設計珠寶，而且是一個你嘗試和渴望擁有的珠寶 然而我覺得，當你設計時 對那個你設計的社區來說 你不是在改進便是在破壞"}, {"zh-tw": " So you're not just doinga building for the residents or for the people who are going to use it,but for the community as a whole. And in 1999, we started by respondingto the issue of the housing crisis for returning refugees in Kosovo.", "en": " 所以你並不是單單是為了那些居民建造房屋 或是那些將會使用那些房屋的人們 而是為了那整個社區 在1999年，我們通過為在科索沃返回的難民 解答房屋危機而開始"}, {"zh-tw": " And I didn't know what I was doing --like I said, mid-20s -- and I'm the Internet generation,so we started a website. We put a call out there,and to my surprise, in a couple of months, we had hundreds of entriesfrom around the world.", "en": " 我那時候不知道我在做什麼，就像我說的，我那時20多歲 正值網路的時代，所以我們開始了一個網站 我們在網站上發起召喚，讓我吃驚的是 在幾個月內，我們收到數百名來自世界各地參賽作品"}, {"zh-tw": " That led to a numberof prototypes being built and really experimenting with some ideas. Two years later we started doing a project on developing mobile health clinicsin sub-Saharan Africa, responding to the HIV/AIDS pandemic.", "en": " 於是我們興建了一些建築範本 以及把一些概念嘗試了 兩年後，我們開始了一個 應對在非洲撒哈拉以南數個，在愛滋病的 流行而開發的流動診所項目"}, {"zh-tw": " That led to 550 entries from 53 countries. We also have designersfrom around the world that participate.", "en": " 結果我們收到來自53個國家共550個參賽作品 我們有來自世界各地的設計師參加這個項目"}, {"zh-tw": " And we had an exhibitof work that followed that. 2004 was the tipping point for us.", "en": " 而且我們也展覽了隨後的設計 2004年是我們的轉捩點"}, {"zh-tw": " We started responding to natural disasters and getting involved in Iran, in Bam, also following up on our work in Africa. Working within the United States -- most people look at povertyand they see the face of a foreigner.", "en": " 我們開始對自然災害產生應對 也開始了在伊朗和巴姆的工作 同時間我們在非洲的工作也持續進行 在美國 大部分人對貧窮感到陌生"}, {"zh-tw": " But I live in Bozeman, Montana -- go up to the north plainson the reservations, or go down to Alabamaor Mississippi, pre-Katrina, and I could have shown youplaces that have far worse conditions than many developing countriesthat I've been to. So we got involved in and workedin inner cities and elsewhere; and also, I will go intosome more projects.", "en": " 但當你在 -- 我住在蒙大拿州波茲曼市-- 往北走到了北部平原上的保留帶 或南下到阿拉巴馬州和密西西比州 在卡崔娜颶風來襲前，你可以看到一些 生活條件比發展中國家國家來得要差的地方 因此，我們在內陸城市和其他地方開始參與和工作 等一下我會介紹更多的項目"}, {"zh-tw": " 2005: Mother Nature kicked our ass. I think we can pretty much assumethat 2005 was a horrific year when it comes to natural disasters.", "en": " 然後是2005年的大自然災害 我認為我們幾乎可以肯定2005年是令人恐懼的一年 當涉及到自然災害的時候"}, {"zh-tw": " And because of the Internet, and because of connectionsto blogs and so forth, within literally hours of the tsunami,we were already raising funds, getting involved, workingwith people on the ground. We run from a couple of laptops,and in the first couple of days, I had 4,000 emailsfrom people needing help.", "en": " 而由於網際網路 因為連接到部落格等等 在發生海嘯幾個小時後，我們已經在籌集資金 以及參與救災的工作 在最初那幾天，我們靠著幾部筆記本電腦運作 我收到四千多封需要幫助的電子郵件"}, {"zh-tw": " So we began to get involvedin projects there, and I'll talk about some others. And then of course, this yearwe've been responding to Katrina, as well as following upon our reconstruction work.", "en": " 所以我們開始參與那邊的方案 我將談點別的 當然，這一年我們在做和卡崔娜颶風相應的工作 以及重建工程的後續工作"}, {"zh-tw": " So this is a brief overview. In 2004, I really couldn't managethe number of people who wanted to help, or the number of requeststhat I was getting.", "en": " 這是一個簡要的概述 2004年，我真的無法應付 那些大量需要幫助的人 或是那些要求幫助的請求"}, {"zh-tw": " It was all cominginto my laptop and cell phone. So we decided to embracean open-source model of business -- so that anyone, anywhere in the world,could start a local chapter, and they can get involvedin local problems.", "en": " 那些請求全來到我的筆記電腦和手機裡 因此，我們決定採用一個開放 -- 基本上是一個開源的商業模式 即任何人，在世界任何地方，可以開始一個地方分會 然後他們可以參與當地的問題"}, {"zh-tw": " Because I believe thereis no such thing as Utopia. All problems are local.All solutions are local.", "en": " 因為我不相信所謂的烏托邦 所有問題都是地方性的，所有解決方案也都是地方性的"}, {"zh-tw": " So that means, you know,somebody who's based in Mississippi knows more about Mississippi than I do. So what happened is, we used Meetupand all these other Internet tools, and we ended up having40 chapters starting up, thousands of architects in 104 countries.", "en": " 因此，這意味著 住在密西西比州人 比我更清楚了解密西西比州 因此，我們用MeetUp和所有其他這類型的網路工具 結果我們開了40個分會 與及數千多名建築師分佈在104個國家"}, {"zh-tw": " So the bullet point --sorry, I never do a suit, so I knew that I was goingto take this off. OK, because I'm going to do it very quick.", "en": " 所以，重點是 -- 不好意思，我從來沒有穿過西裝 所以我知道我一定會除掉它 因為我打算很快把它除掉"}, {"zh-tw": " This isn't just about nonprofit. What it showed me is thatthere's a grassroots movement going on, of socially responsible designerswho really believe that this world has got a lot smaller,and that we have the opportunity -- not the responsibility,but the opportunity -- to really get involved in making change.", "en": " 因此，在過去7年，這不僅僅是關於非營利 而是它使我相信，有這樣的基層運動在進行 有很多對社會負責的設計師 他們相信這個世界可以團結一起 我們有機會 -- 不是責任 而是機會 -- 去參與改變這個世界"}, {"zh-tw": " I'm adding that to my time. So what you don't know is, we've got these thousands of designersworking around the world, connected basically by a website,and we have a staff of three.", "en": " 我會把這加在我的時間上 所以你不知道的是 我們有數以千計的設計師在世界各地工作 他們僅靠著一個網站聯繫，而我們只有三個工作人員"}, {"zh-tw": " The fact that nobody told uswe couldn't do it, we did it. And so there's somethingto be said about naïveté.", "en": " 通過做一些沒有人告訴我們不能做的事 我們做到了。所以，天真或許不是壞的"}, {"zh-tw": " So seven years later, we've developed so that we've got advocacy,instigation and implementation. We advocate for good design,not only through student workshops and lectures and public forums, op-eds; we have a book on humanitarian work; but also disaster mitigationand dealing with public policy.", "en": " 七年後，我們已經發展到有了提倡、 煽動和實施，我們提倡好的設計 不僅通過學生的研討會和講座，公眾論壇 社論，我們有一本不僅是關於人道主義工作的書 而且它還包括減輕災害和處理公共政策"}, {"zh-tw": " We can talk about FEMA,but that's another talk. Instigation, developing ideaswith communities and NGOs, doing open-source design competitions.", "en": " 我們可以談論聯邦緊急事務管理局，但那會是另一個演講 煽動發展與各社區有關的構思 和非政府組織做開源設計比賽"}, {"zh-tw": " Referring, matchmaking with communities. And then implementing -- actuallygoing out there and doing the work, because when you invent,it's never a reality until it's built.", "en": " 談到與社區配對 然後實施 -- 切切實實地走出去工作 因為當你發明時，直到它建成了，它才是現實"}, {"zh-tw": " So it's really importantthat if we're designing and trying to create change,we build that change. So here's a select number of projects.", "en": " 因此很重要的是，當我們在設計 並試圖創建改變時，我們真真實實地建立這種改變 這裡我選了一些項目"}, {"zh-tw": " Kosovo. This is Kosovo in '99.", "en": " 科索沃，我們在1999年的科索沃做了一個公開的設計比賽"}, {"zh-tw": " We did an open designcompetition, like I said. It led to a whole variety of ideas.", "en": " 就像我說的，這引發了各式各樣的構想"}, {"zh-tw": " And this wasn't about emergency shelter, but transitional shelterthat would last five to 10 years, that would be placed next to the landthe resident lived in, and that they would rebuildtheir own home. This wasn't imposingan architecture on a community; this was giving themthe tools and the space to allow them to rebuild and regrowthe way they want to.", "en": " 這重點不是緊急避難所 而是可持續5到10年的過渡性房屋 而且可放置於該地居民的住宅附近 然後，他們將重建自己家園 這不是把建築強加在社區上 而是給他們的工具 和空間 讓他們重建他們想要的樣子"}, {"zh-tw": " We had from the sublimeto the ridiculous, but they worked. This is an inflatable hemp house.It was built; it works.", "en": " 我們的設計有從宏偉到可笑的，但它們都行得通 這是一個充氣大麻屋，它已建成並可使用"}, {"zh-tw": " This is a shipping container. Built and works.", "en": " 這是一個運輸貨櫃，已建成和很實用"}, {"zh-tw": " And a whole variety of ideas that not only dealt witharchitectural building, but also the issues of governance, and the idea of creating communitiesthrough complex networks. So we've engaged not just designers, but also a whole varietyof technology-based professionals.", "en": " 我們還有和很多不同的想法 不僅涉及建築和設計 還包括治理的問題 和通過複雜的網絡來創建社區理念 因此，我們不僅和設計師合作 還和多種技術為基礎的專業人員合作"}, {"zh-tw": " Using rubble from destroyed homesto create new homes. Using straw bale construction,creating heat walls.", "en": " 使用被摧毀的房屋來建立新的家園 使用稻草包來建設創造太陽能吸熱壁"}, {"zh-tw": " And then something remarkablehappened in '99. We went to Africa originallyto look at the housing issue.", "en": " 然後在1999年時，發生了一件值得注意的事 我們去了非洲，原本只是去看看住屋的問題"}, {"zh-tw": " Within three days, we realizedthe problem was not housing; it was the growing pandemic of HIV/AIDS. And it wasn't doctors telling us this; it was actual villagersthat we were staying with.", "en": " 然而在三天內，我們意識到問題並不是在住屋 而是在日益蔓延的愛滋病 這並不是醫生告訴我們的 而是和我們住在一起的村民告訴我們"}, {"zh-tw": " And so we came up with the bright idea that instead of getting people to walk10, 15 kilometers to see doctors, you get the doctors to the people. And we started engagingthe medical community, and you know, we thoughtwe were real bright sparks -- \"We've come up with this great idea: mobile health clinics, widely distributedthroughout sub-Saharan Africa.\" And the medical community there said, \"We've said this for the last decade.", "en": " 因此，我們想出了一個好主意 與其讓人們步行10、15公里去看醫生，還不如把醫生帶到他們去 便是這樣，我們開始參與的醫學界的工作 那時候，我們認為我們是真的很聰明，就像火花一樣閃燿 -- 我們想出這一個偉大的構想，流動診所-- 一個可以廣泛分佈在非洲撒哈拉以南的流動診所 那裡的社區和醫界對我們說 「我們在過去的十年也是這樣想，我們早已知道這一點"}, {"zh-tw": " We know this. We just don't knowhow to show this.\" So in a way, we had taken pre-existingneeds and shown solutions. And so again, we had a whole varietyof ideas that came in.", "en": " 我們只是不知道怎樣實行。」 在某種程度上，我們拿了一個早存在的需要，然後找出解決方案 因此，我們再次找到各式各樣的概念"}, {"zh-tw": " This one I personally love, because the idea is that architectureis not just about solutions, but about raising awareness. This is a kenaf clinic.", "en": " 這一個是我個人喜愛 概念是建築不只是用來解決問題 還包括提高人們的意識"}, {"zh-tw": " You get seed and you grow itin a plot of land, and it grows 14 feet in a month. And on the fourth week, the doctorscome and they mow out an area, put a tensile structure on the top, and when the doctorshave finished treating and seeing patients and villagers, you cut down the clinic and you eat it.", "en": " 這是一個紅麻診所。你拿一顆種子，然後把它種在土地 一個月裡它便會生長14英尺 在第四個星期，醫生會來了把草刈掉 再把一個拉伸結構放在頂部 當醫生完成治療 和看完病人和村民後"}, {"zh-tw": " It's an eat-your-own-clinic. So it's dealing with the factthat if you have AIDS, you also need to have nutrition rates, and the idea of nutrition is as important as getting antiretrovirals out there.", "en": " 你可以把診所砍下來吃，這是一個可以吃掉的診所 我們面對的是，如果你有愛滋病 你要明白你是需要營養 以及明白營養的重要性 是和得到抗病毒藥物是一樣重要的"}, {"zh-tw": " So you know, this is a serious solution. This one I love.", "en": " 所以這是一個十分重要的解決方法"}, {"zh-tw": " The idea is it's not just a clinic,it's a community center. This looked at setting up trade routes and economic engines within the community, so it can be a self-sustaining project.", "en": " 這個是我的喜愛，因為它不僅僅是一個診所，還是一個社區中心 這個是關於建立貿易路線 和經濟引擎在社區內 這樣社區便可以自給自足"}, {"zh-tw": " Every one of these projectsis sustainable. That's not becauseI'm a tree-hugging green person.", "en": " 每一個方案都是永續的 我這樣做並不是因為狂熱環保份子"}, {"zh-tw": " It's because when you liveon four dollars a day, you're living on survivaland you have to be sustainable. You have to know whereyour energy is coming from, you have to know whereyour resource is coming from, and you have to keep the maintenance down.", "en": " 而是因為當你每天只可以花四元的時候 你要生存便必須生活在永續中 你要知道你的能量是從哪裡來 你要知道你的資源是來自哪 你必須保持把需要維修的減少"}, {"zh-tw": " So this is about gettingan economic engine, and then at night,it turns into a movie theater. So it's not an AIDS clinic.It's a community center.", "en": " 因此，這是有關獲取經濟的引擎 然後靈活運用 因此它不僅僅是一個愛滋病診所，它也是一個社區中心"}, {"zh-tw": " So you can see ideas. And these ideas developed into prototypes, and they were eventually built.", "en": " 你可以看到我們把不同的想法發展成範本"}, {"zh-tw": " And currently, as of this year, there are clinics rolling outin Nigeria and Kenya. From that, we also developed Siyathemba.", "en": " 然後最終把它們建成， 今年目前 我們已經有新建的診所在尼日利亞和肯亞 我們之後還開發了西亞添巴，這個方案 --"}, {"zh-tw": " The community came to us and said, \"The problem is that the girlsdon't have education.\" And we're working in an area where young womenbetween the ages of 16 and 24 have a 50 percent HIV/AIDS rate. And that's notbecause they're promiscuous, it's because there's no knowledge.", "en": " 那社區來找我們，告訴我們 他們的問題是女孩沒有受到教育 那地方年齡介乎 16至24歲的的女生 有一半是患有愛滋病 這並不是因為他們濫交 而是因為他們沒有知識"}, {"zh-tw": " And so we decided to lookat the idea of sports, and create a youth sports center that doubled as an HIV/AIDSoutreach center, and the coaches of the girls' teamwere also trained doctors. So that there would be a very slow wayof developing confidence in health care.", "en": " 因此我們決定用運動的構思來建造一個青年體育中心 而它同時作用愛滋病宣傳中心 那裡當教練的女孩同一時間也是受過專門培訓的醫生 我們用有一個很穩健的方式 來建立當地的保健"}, {"zh-tw": " And we picked nine finalists, and then those nine finalists weredistributed throughout the entire region, and then the communitypicked their design. They said, this is our design, because it's not onlyabout engaging a community; it's about empowering a community, and about getting them to bea part of the rebuilding process.", "en": " 我們最後選了九個決賽者 他們分佈在整個區域 然後我們讓那社區挑選他們喜歡的設計 他們說，這是屬於我們的設計 因為它不單只致力於社區 它還賦予這個社區力量 讓他們成為重建進程的一部分"}, {"zh-tw": " So, the winning design is here. And then, of course,we actually go and work with the community and the clients.", "en": " 這便是比賽的優勝作品 我們也切切實實地和地區與客戶一起工作"}, {"zh-tw": " So this is the designer. He's out there workingwith the first ever women's soccer team in KwaZulu-Natal, Siyathemba.", "en": " 你可以看到這個設計師與在西亞添巴 誇祖魯納塔爾第一支女子足球隊一起工作"}, {"zh-tw": " And they can tell it better.
