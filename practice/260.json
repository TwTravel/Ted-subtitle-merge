One of the great things was that my father was an avid golfer, but he was lefty.", "en": " 我指的是學習的過程 很棒的是我父親是一位很有熱情的高爾夫球員，但他是左撇子"}, {"zh-tw": " And he had a real passion for golf, and he also created this whole mythology about Ben Hogan and various things. Well, I learned a lot about interesting things that I knew nothing about at the time, but grew to know stuff about.", "en": " 他真的很熱愛高爾夫 也創造了這整個關於 班·霍根（Ben Hogan）的神話 我從有趣的事情中學到很多 雖然我在當下可能不自覺，但漸漸地體會箇中奧妙"}, {"zh-tw": " And that was the mythology of skill. So, one of the things that I love to do is to explore skill.", "en": " 而這就是技藝創造的神話 探究技藝是我熱愛的事情之一"}, {"zh-tw": " And since Richard put me on this whole thing with music -- I'm supposed to actually be doing a project with Tod Machover with the MIT Media Lab -- it relates a lot to music. But Tod couldn't come and the project is sort of somewhere, I'm not sure whether it's happening the way we thought, or not.", "en": " 而且既然理查（Richard）把我放在這個跟音樂相關的舞台上 我就得真的和托德·麥克歐佛（Tod Machover）、 和麻省理工學院的媒介實驗室做一個和音樂相關的計畫 但是托德沒辦法來，整個計畫也有一點... 不是很確定事情是不是照我們想像的方向走"}, {"zh-tw": " But I'm going to explore skill, and juggling, and basically visual music, I guess. OK, you can start the music, thanks.", "en": " 但我還是要探索這項技藝，做雜技表演 我想基本上就都是「視覺音樂」 音樂可以開始了，謝謝"}, {"zh-tw": " (Music) Thanks. Thank you. Now, juggling can be a lot of fun; play with skill and play with space, play with rhythm. And you can turn the mike on now. I'm going to do a couple of pieces.", "en": " （音樂） 謝謝、謝謝大家。雜技可以很有趣 可以跟技術、空間、節奏一起玩 可以開麥克風了。我現在要秀兩段"}, {"zh-tw": " I do a big piece in a triangle and these are three sections from it. Part of the challenge was to try to understand rhythm and space using not just my hands -- because a lot of juggling is hand-oriented -- but using the rhythm of my body and feet, and controlling the balls with my feet.", "en": " 一段比較長的是在一個三角形裡做 其中包括三小節 一部分的挑戰是必須要試著瞭解整個節奏和空間 用的不只是我的雙手--- 因為很多雜技是以手作為基底的 但我還會融合身體和雙腳的律動 並用腳控制這些球"}, {"zh-tw": " Thanks. Now, this next section was an attempt to explore space. You see, I think Richard said something about people that are against something.", "en": " 謝謝。 我記得理查說過有關人類喜歡挑戰"}, {"zh-tw": " Well, a lot of people think jugglers defy gravity or do stuff. Well, I kind of, from my childhood and golf and all that, it's a process of joining with forces.", "en": " 很多人覺得雜技表演者喜歡做一些挑戰地心引力的事情 我的話，則是從童年時和打高爾夫那時就開始了 這是與力結合的過程"}, {"zh-tw": " And so what I'd like to do is try to figure out how to join with the space through the technique. So juggling gravity -- up, down.", "en": " 所以我想做的是試著藉由我的技術 找出融入「空間」的方法 把地心引力拿來雜耍--- 上、下"}, {"zh-tw": " If you figure out what up and down really are, it's a complex physical set of skills to be able to throw a ball down and up and everything, but then you add in sideways. Now, I look at it somewhat as a way -- when you learn juggling what you learn is how to feel with your eyes, and see with your hands because you're not looking at your hands, you're looking at where the balls are or you're looking at the audience.", "en": " 如果你真的明白了什麼是「上」、什麼是「下」 你會知道它是一套錯綜複雜的物理技能 才有辦法把球拋上丟下 然後還可以橫著來 現在，我是這樣的角度看它的--你在學雜技的時候 你是學著用眼睛去感覺它，然後用手去看它 因為你不是看著你的手 你是看著球、或是觀眾的"}, {"zh-tw": " So this next part is really a way of understanding space and rhythm, with the obvious reference to the feet, but it's also time -- where the feet were, where the balls were. Thanks. So, visual music: rhythm and complexity.", "en": " 下一步就是真的要瞭解空間和律動了 這和腳也脫不了關係 還有時間點、腳在哪兒、球在哪兒 謝謝。這包括了視覺音樂、律動以及複雜度"}, {"zh-tw": " I'm going to build towards complexity now. Juggling three balls is simple and normal.", "en": " 我現在就要提高複雜度了 拋三個球是很簡單、很正常的"}, {"zh-tw": " Excuse me. We're jugglers, OK. And remember, you're transposing, you're getting into a subculture here.", "en": " 抱歉 我們是雜技表演者。好，記得，你是在調換它的位置 現在進入的是一個次文化"}, {"zh-tw": " And juggling -- the balls cross and all that. OK, if you keep them in their assigned paths you get parallel lines of different heights, but then hopefully even rhythm.", "en": " 然後把球拋過去 OK，如果你把它們保持在固定的路線，你會得到平行線 不同的高度，但希望是同樣的節奏"}, {"zh-tw": " And you can change the rhythm -- good, Michael. You can change the rhythm, if you get out of the lights.", "en": " 然後你可以改變節奏--- 很好 不在光線裡時，你可以變換節奏"}, {"zh-tw": " OK? Change the rhythm, so it's even. Or you can go back and change the height. Now, skill.", "en": " OK? 改變節奏讓它平均 你也可以回到原狀然後改變高度。現在，技巧"}, {"zh-tw": " But you're boxed in, if you can only do it up and down that way. So, you've got to go after the space down there.", "en": " 如果你只會這樣做上下的話，你會被侷限住 你得把空間放大到這兒來"}, {"zh-tw": " OK, then you've got to combine them, because then you have the whole spatial palette in front of you. And then you get crazy.", "en": " 然後你要把它們結合在一起 整個空間就像是調色盤一樣在你面前 然後瘋了"}, {"zh-tw": " Now, I'm actually going to ask you to try something, so you've got to pay attention. Complexity: if you spend enough time doing something, time slows down or your skill increases, so your perceptions change. It's learning skills -- like being in a high-speed car crash.", "en": " 現在，我真的要請你們做件事了 你要很專心喔。複雜度， 如果你花夠長的時間做一件事，時間會變慢 或是你的技能會提昇，你的感官能力也起了變化 學習技能像是經歷一場高速車禍"}, {"zh-tw": " Things slow down as you learn, as you learn, as you learn. You may not be able to affect it, it almost drifts on you. It goes.", "en": " 事情會在你學習的過程中變慢，你學著、學著... 或許你沒辦法影響它，你是隨著它漂流、前進的"}, {"zh-tw": " But that's the closest approximation I can have to it. So, complexity. Now, how many here are jugglers? OK, so most of you are going to have a similar reaction to this.", "en": " 但這是我能做的最貼切的形容了 回到複雜度。在座有多少人是會做雜技表演呀？ 那大部分的人等一下將會有差不多的反應"}, {"zh-tw": " OK? And whoever laughed there -- you understood it completely, right? No, it looks like a mess. It looks like a mess with a guy there, who's got his hands around that mess, OK. Well, that's what juggling is about, right? It's being able to do something that other people can't do or can't understand.", "en": " OK? 不管在那邊笑的是哪位 你都完全瞭解了，對吧？ 這看起來亂七八糟。那位仁兄看起來好像遇到麻煩了 兩手搞的一團亂的那一位 反正這就是雜耍的真諦嘛，對吧？ 就是做一些別人做不到、或搞不懂的事嘛"}, {"zh-tw": " All right. So, that's one way of doing it, which is five balls down. OK? Another way is the outside.", "en": " 好，這是其中一種方式，五顆球朝下 另一種方式是朝外的"}, {"zh-tw": " And you could play with the rhythm. Same pattern.", "en": " 你可以跟著節奏玩 同樣的手法"}, {"zh-tw": " Make it faster and smaller. Make it wider.", "en": " 只是要加速、縮小範圍 拉大範圍"}, {"zh-tw": " Make it narrower. Bring it back up.", "en": " 或是窄一點 帶回上頭來"}, {"zh-tw": " OK. It's done. Thanks. Now, what I wanted to get to is that you're all very bright, very tactile.", "en": " 好，結束，謝謝！ 現在，你們看起來都很聰明、靈敏"}, {"zh-tw": " I have no idea how computer-oriented or three-dimensionally-oriented you are, but let's try something. OK, so since you all don't understand what the five-ball pattern is, I'm going to give you a little clue.", "en": " 我雖然不知道對電腦、對三度空間有多在行 但我們來試試看這個 好，因為你們都不清楚剛剛那五顆球的路徑模式 我現在要給你一點線索"}, {"zh-tw": " Enough of a clue? So, you get the pattern, right? OK. You're not getting off that easy. All right? Now, do me a favor: follow the ball that I ask you to follow.", "en": " 線索夠了吧？你抓住路線了，對吧？ 沒那麼容易，好嗎？ 現在，幫我個忙。看著我要你們看的那顆球"}, {"zh-tw": " Green. Yellow.", "en": " 綠色 黃色"}, {"zh-tw": " Pink. White.", "en": " 粉紅色 白色"}, {"zh-tw": " OK, you can do that? Yeah? OK. Now, let's actually learn something.", "en": " 都做到了嗎？好 我們現在真的來學點東西"}, {"zh-tw": " Actually, let me put you in that area of learning, which is very insecure. You want to do it? Yeah? OK.", "en": " 讓我把你們放到「學習」的框框裡，讓人有不安的感覺吧 想要試試看嗎？好"}, {"zh-tw": " Hands out in front of you. Palms up, together. What you're going to learn is this.", "en": " 伸出雙手、手掌向上、併攏 你現在要學的是這個"}, {"zh-tw": " OK? So what I want you to do is just listen to me and do it. Index finger, middle finger, ring, little.", "en": " OK嗎？現在你要聽我說，然後跟著做 食指、中指、無名指、小指"}, {"zh-tw": " Little, ring, middle, index. And then open. Finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger.", "en": " 小指、無名指、中指、食指。然後打開 手指、手指、手指、手指、手指、手指、手指、手指"}, {"zh-tw": " A little bit faster. Finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger.", "en": " 加快速度 手指、手指、手指、手指、手指、手指、手指、手指"}, {"zh-tw": " Finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger. All right. A lot of different learning processes going on in here.", "en": " 手指、手指、手指、手指、手指、手指、手指、手指 好，現場就有很多不同的學習過程"}, {"zh-tw": " One learning process that I see is this -- OK. Another learning process that I see is this -- OK. So, everybody take a deep breath in, breath out. OK. Now, one more time, and -- finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger. Open.", "en": " 我看到的其中一種是這樣的 還看到一種是這樣的 好，大家深呼吸一口、吐氣。OK 現在，再一次，預備--- 手指、手指、手指、手指、手指、手指、手指、手指、打開"}, {"zh-tw": " Finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger. OK. Shake your hands out.", "en": " 手指、手指、手指、手指、手指、手指、手指、手指、好！ 甩甩手"}, {"zh-tw": " Now, I assume a lot of you spend a lot of time at a computer. OK? So, what you're doing is, you're going la, la, la, and you're getting this. OK? So that's exactly what I'm going to ask you to do, but in a slightly different way. You're going to combine it.", "en": " 我想很多人都花很多時間在電腦上吧？ OK? 你都是這樣做-- 啦啦啦 然後變成這樣，OK? 這正是我要叫你做的 但有一點點不同。你要融合兩者"}, {"zh-tw": " So what I want you to do is -- fingers. I'll tell you what to do with your fingers, same thing.", "en": " 我要你動的是手指 我會跟你說你的手指頭要做什麼，跟剛才一樣"}, {"zh-tw": " But I want you to do is also, with your eyes, is follow the colored ball that I ask you to follow. OK? Here we go.", "en": " 但我還要你用眼睛一起 跟著我叫你看的顏色的球 OK? 來吧"}, {"zh-tw": " So, we're going to start off looking at the white ball -- and I'm going to tell you which color, and I'm also going to tell you to go with your fingers. OK? So white ball and -- finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger. Pink. Finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger.

It's a moment that you can't make sense of.", "en": " 做的如何呀？不錯嗎？我要你們這麼做的原因是 因為這是大部分人一生中一直在面對的 學習的片刻、挑戰的片刻 是個讓你沒有頭緒的瞬間"}, {"zh-tw": " Why the hell should I learn this? OK? Does it really have anything to do with anything in my life? You know, I can't decipher -- is it fun? Is it challenging? Am I supposed to cheat? You know, what are you supposed to do?

Talking about time in a moment.", "en": " 我沒事幹嘛要學這個啊？ 這真的跟我的人生有關嗎？ 我也沒辦法解答--- 那好玩嗎？有挑戰性嗎？可以作弊嗎？ 你能怎麼辦呢？ 台上這個人做這套原理 做了一輩子了，好嗎？ 想要搞懂它，但是它會幫你搞懂什麼嗎？ 那只是個瞬間。就這樣，OK? 我要改一下腳本。讓我做一下這個 這裡不用音樂。待會兒就會談到\"時間\""}, {"zh-tw": " There's a piece that I recently developed which was all about that, a moment.

Ahhh.", "en": " 現在我要開始表演一些原創的了 是從我發展的進階變化而來的。好了嗎？ \"一瞬間\"，你會如何定義一瞬間？ 身為雜技表演者，我想做的是創造出一項 能代表一瞬間的東西 啊～"}, {"zh-tw": " All right, I'm going to get on my knees and do it. So, a moment.", "en": " 好，我現在要跪著，然後開始了 瞬間"}, {"zh-tw": " (Rattling) OK?

All right. OK. Can we show the video of the triangle? Are we ready to do that? Yes? This is the piece that I told you about.", "en": " 我想說我要聊一下一瞬間 好，OK，我們可以放一段關於三角型的影片嗎？ 準備好可以放了嗎？可以嗎？ 這一段是我之前提到的"}, {"zh-tw": " It's a much bigger piece that I do exploring the space of a geometric triangle.

Balance: making up the rules so you can't cheat, so you learn to approach stillness with different parts of your body.", "en": " 作弊！ 平衡-- 制定一些規則讓你不能作弊 你才能學會怎麼用身體的不同部位達到靜止"}, {"zh-tw": " To have a conversation with it. To speak. To listen. Hup. Now, it's dependent on rhythm, and keeping a center of balance. When it falls, going underneath.", "en": " 跟它對話。說話、聆聽 現在，要跟著節奏 在它落下時維持一個平衡的中心點，然後在下面接"}, {"zh-tw": " So, there's a rhythm to it. The rhythm can get much smaller.", "en": " 它有個節奏 節奏可以變得小很多"}, {"zh-tw": " As your skill increases, you learn to find those tinier spaces, those tinier movements. Thanks.

That has a certain kind of balance to it, which is all about plumb.", "en": " 你可以用棍子、跟著音樂 （音樂） 謝謝。剛剛那段涵蓋著垂直原理的平衡"}, {"zh-tw": " I apprenticed with a carpenter and learned about plumb, square and level.

Oh, let's see here.", "en": " （音樂） 用不同的方式在空間、空間中的線條運作 喔，來看看這個"}, {"zh-tw": " So, I'll come back to that in a second. But working with one ball, now, what if you attach something to it, or change it. This is a little thing that I made because I really like the idea of curves and balls together.", "en": " 等一下會回到這裡。先來一個球的表演 如果你加點東西進去，或是做點變化 這是我做的小變化 因為我真的很喜歡曲線和球一起運作的感覺"}, {"zh-tw": " And then creating space and the rhythm of space, using the surface of the balls, the surface of the arms.

The next piece that I'm going to do -- which is the cylinders piece, if you want to get that up -- it has to do with cylinder seals from about 5,000 years ago, which were stones with designs that were used to roll over wet clay with all sorts of great designs. I love ceramics and all of that.", "en": " 有時候周遭發生的事情 會影響我選擇表演物體的決定 接下來我要做的是一個滾筒的表演 如果你想知道的話 它是跟5,000年前的滾筒印章有關 滾筒印章是帶有雕刻設計的石頭、用來在濕泥土上滾動的 有各式各樣的設計。我好愛那些和製陶相關的東西"}, {"zh-tw": " It's a combination of that, the beauty of that, the shape, and the stories that were involved in it, as well as the fact that they protected the contents. The second influence on this piece came from recycling and looking into a tin can recycling bin and seeing all that beautiful emptiness.", "en": " 那是一個結合體，裡面包含的美、它的形狀、 和它們所述說的故事 當然它們還可以保護筒裡的東西 另一個影響這段表演的靈感來自於資源回收 注視著資源回收桶裡的空罐時 凝視著那空洞的美感"}, {"zh-tw": " So, if you want to go with the music for cylinders.

I like not to know for as long as possible.
