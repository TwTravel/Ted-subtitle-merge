I met with David to talk about what I might do in his company.", "en": " 1992年，我開始為一家 名為Interval Research的公司工作 當時這家公司才剛成立 創辦人是大衛利德與保羅艾倫 是位於矽谷的一家營利研究企業 我跟大衛見面 討論我能為他的公司做些甚麼"}, {"zh-tw": " I was just coming out of a failed virtual reality business and supporting myself by being on the speaking circuit and writing books -- after twenty years or so in the computer game industry having ideas that people didn't think they could sell. And David and I discovered that we had a question in common, that we really wanted the answer to, and that was, \"Why hasn't anybody built any computer games for little girls?\" Why is that? It can't just be a giant sexist conspiracy.", "en": " 當時我剛走出虛擬實境生意失敗的陰霾 只能靠著四處演講 還有寫作維生 我從事遊戲產業廿多年來 知道這種遊戲一向不被看好 大衛和我發現 我倆有一個共同的疑問 急待解答 那就是 \"為什麼沒有人專為小女生設計電玩?\" 道理何在? 這不可能只是男性主導下的結果"}, {"zh-tw": " These people aren't that smart. There's six billion dollars on the table.", "en": " 這些人沒那麼精明 這塊價值六十億美元的市場大餅"}, {"zh-tw": " They would go for it if they could figure out how. So, what is the deal here? And as we thought about our goals -- I should say that Interval is really a humanistic institution, in the classical sense that humanism, at its best, finds a way to combine clear-eyed empirical research with a set of core values that fundamentally love and respect people.", "en": " 懂得門路的人肯定想分一杯羹 問題究竟出在哪? 談到我們的目標 我得說Interval真的是以人為本的公司 我是指傳統定義的以人為本 理想上，人本主義 能將慧眼獨具的實證研究 與核心價值結合 這套價值就是對人類充滿愛與尊敬"}, {"zh-tw": " The basic idea of humanism is the improvable quality of life; that we can do good things, that there are things worth doing because they're good things to do, and that clear-eyed empiricism can help us figure out how to do them. So, contrary to popular belief, there is not a conflict of interest between empiricism and values.", "en": " 人本主義的基本概念 是不斷提升生活品質 使人們願意行善 有些事值得我們去做 因為這些都是好事 而慧眼獨具的實證研究 有助於我們發掘為善之道 因此，跟一般人以為的恰好相反 實證研究和人文價值間不存在利害衝突"}, {"zh-tw": " And Interval Research is kind of the living example of how that can be true. So David and I decided to go find out, through the best research we could muster, what it would take to get a little girl to put her hands on a computer, to achieve the level of comfort and ease with the technology that little boys have because they play video games.", "en": " Interval Research公司就是現成的例子 證明的確如此 所以大衛和我決定 要盡力研究 找出讓小女生 願意接觸電腦的祕訣 從而享受科技帶來的舒適自在 小男生玩電玩時就是這種感覺"}, {"zh-tw": " We spent two and a half years conducting research; we spent another year and a half in advance development. Then we formed a spin-off company.", "en": " 我們花費兩年半時間進行研究 接著又投入一年半時間深入研發 然後成立了一家子公司"}, {"zh-tw": " In the research phase of the project at Interval, we partnered with a company called Cheskin Research, and these people -- Davis Masten and Christopher Ireland -- changed my mind entirely about what market research was and what it could be. They taught me how to look and see, and they did not do the incredibly stupid thing of saying to a child, \"Of all these things we already make you, which do you like best?\" -- which gives you zero answers that are usable.", "en": " 在本計劃的研究階段 我們和Cheskin Research公司合作 而與大衛麥斯登及克里斯多福艾爾蘭等人共事 徹底改變我對市場調查的看法 重新認識它真正的功能 他們教我如何觀察調查對象 而且他們不會蠢到 直接問小孩子 \"這幾樣東西裡頭， 你最喜歡哪一樣?\" 這種問法不可能問出有用的答案"}, {"zh-tw": " So, what we did for the first two and a half years was four things: We did an extensive review of the literature in related fields, like cognitive psychology, spatial cognition, gender studies, play theory, sociology, primatology. Thank you Frans de Waal, wherever you are, I love you and I'd give anything to meet you.", "en": " 所以剛開頭的兩年半 我們做了四件事： 首先是大規模的文獻回顧 探討相關領域的研究成果，例如認知心理學 空間認知、性別研究 遊戲論、社會學、靈長類動物學--- 感謝你 法蘭茲杜佛，無論你在哪 非常感激你，無論如何我要再見你一面"}, {"zh-tw": " After we had done that with a pretty large team of people and discovered what we thought the salient issues were with girls and boys and playing -- because, after all, that's really what this is about -- we moved to the second phase of our work, where we interviewed adult experts in academia, some of the people who'd produced the literature that we found relevant. Also, we did focus groups with people who were on the ground with kids every day, like playground supervisors. We talked to them, confirmed some hypotheses and identified some serious questions about gender difference and play.", "en": " 接著我們與一個龐大的團隊完成文獻回顧 並且發現我們認為最核心的問題 和男孩、女孩以及角色扮演有關 因為，無論如何，這才是問題的癥結所在 我們進行到研究工作的第二階段 採訪學術界的成年專家 他們之中有些人 出版了相關的學術著作 我們也與每天和小孩互動的人做焦點團體訪談 像是遊樂場主管之類，跟他們聊一聊 確認了一些假設 找出和性別差異與遊戲有關的重要問題"}, {"zh-tw": " Then we did what I consider to be the heart of the work: interviewed 1,100 children, boys and girls, ages seven to 12, all over the United States -- except for Silicon Valley, Boston and Austin because we knew that their little families would have millions of computers in them and they wouldn't be a representative sample. And at the end of those remarkable conversations with kids and their best friends across the United States, after two years, we pulled together some survey data from another 10,000 children, drew up a set up of what we thought were the key findings of our research, and spent another year transforming them into design heuristics, for designing computer-based products -- and, in fact, any kind of products -- for little girls, ages eight to 12.", "en": " 然後我們著手我認為是核心的工作 我們訪談了1100位兒童，男女都有 他們的年齡介於7至12歲，來自全美各地 但矽谷、波斯頓及奧斯丁的兒童除外 因為我們知道這些地區的小家庭電腦多到氾濫 所以這些兒童樣本不具代表性 這些對話真的很特別 跟全美各地的孩子及他們的好朋友談完 又過了兩年 我們又蒐集了一萬名兒童的數據，得出本研究的重要發現 再用一年時間將這些資料化為設計靈感 用以設計電腦相關產品 實際上是適用於8到12歲小女孩的各類產品"}, {"zh-tw": " And we spent that time designing interactive prototypes for computer software and testing them with little girls. In 1996, in November, we formed the company Purple Moon which was a spinoff of Interval Research, and our chief investors were Interval Research, Vulcan Northwest, Institutional Venture Partners and Allen and Company.", "en": " 我們花時間設計互動式電腦原型軟體 讓小女孩試玩 1996年11月，我們成立了Purple Moon公司 作為Interval Research旗下的子公司 主要投資人有Interval Research、Vulcan Northwest Institutional Venture Partners 及 Allen and Company"}, {"zh-tw": " We launched a website on September 2nd that has now served 25 million pages, and has 42,000 registered young girl users. They visit an average of one and a half times a day, spend an average of 35 minutes a visit, and look at 50 pages a visit.", "en": " 我們的網站於九月二日開通後 至今累積了兩千五百萬網頁閱讀量 並有四萬兩千名年輕女孩用戶註冊 她們平均一天...造訪我們的網站一到兩次 每次平均停留35分鐘 瀏覽50個頁面"}, {"zh-tw": " So we feel that we've formed a successful online community with girls. We launched two titles in October -- \"Rockett's New School\" -- the first of a series of products -- is about a character called Rockett beginning her first day of school in eighth grade at a brand new place, with a blank slate, which allows girls to play with the question of, \"What will I be like when I'm older?\" \"What's it going to be like to be in high school or junior high school? Who are my friends?\"; to exercise the love of social complexity and the narrative intelligence that drives most of their play behavior; and which embeds in it values about noticing that we have lots of choices in our lives and the ways that we conduct ourselves.", "en": " 所以我們覺得這個線上女孩社群相當成功 我們在十月份推出了兩款遊戲 \"洛綺特的新學校\" 這是系列產品的第一款，描述女主角洛綺特第一天上學的經歷 敘述八年級的她如何在新環境裡展開新生活 藉這遊戲女孩們能夠思索一些問題，像是\"長大後的我會是甚麼樣子?\" \"上高中或國中後會是怎樣的生活?\" \"誰會跟我交朋友?\" 體驗複雜社交生活 有哪些迷人之處，並享受引導遊戲的故事情節 遊戲情節中隱含了一種價值觀 就是無論是生活或做人處事，我們都有很多選擇"}, {"zh-tw": " The other title that we launched is called \"Secret Paths in the Forest,\" which addresses the more fantasy-oriented, inner lives of girls. These two titles both showed up in the top 50 entertainment titles in PC Data -- entertainment titles in PC Data in December, right up there with \"John Madden Football,\" which thrills me to death.", "en": " 另一款遊戲叫做\"神秘森林小徑\" 描述少女夢幻的內心世界 這兩款遊戲都擠進北美PC遊戲銷售榜前五十名 PC遊戲銷售榜前五十名 12月時竟然跟\"約翰麥登橄欖球\"這款暢銷遊戲並列 差點沒把我給嚇死"}, {"zh-tw": " So, we're real, and we've touched several hundreds of thousands of little girls. We've made half-a-billion impressions with marketing and PR for this brand, Purple Moon.", "en": " 是阿，我們辦到了 我們成功觸動了數十萬少女的心 我們創造五億多的曝光率 透過行銷與推廣Purple Moon這個品牌"}, {"zh-tw": " Ninety-six percent of them, roughly, have been positive; four percent of them have been \"other.\" I want to talk about the other, because the politics of this enterprise, in a way, have been the most fascinating part of it, for me. There are really two kinds of negative reviews that we've received.", "en": " 大約96%的人對我們印象不錯 剩下4%的人有不同看法 我想談談這4%的部分 因為這家企業的戰術運用就某方面而言 是最吸引我的部分 我們收到的負面評價分為兩大類"}, {"zh-tw": " One kind of reviewer is a male gamer who thinks he knows what games ought to be, and won't show the product to little girls. The other kind of reviewer is a certain flavor of feminist who thinks they know what little girls ought to be.", "en": " 一派是男性玩家的評論 他們自以為很懂遊戲 不會給女孩子玩我們的產品 另一派帶點女性主義調調的評論家 自以為很了解小女孩該有的樣子"}, {"zh-tw": " And so it's funny to me that these interesting, odd bedfellows have one thing in common: they don't listen to little girls. They haven't looked at children and they're certainly not demonstrating any love for them.", "en": " 奇怪的是，這些奇怪又難相處的傢伙 有一項共同點 就是不會傾聽小女孩的心聲 他們從未好好觀察過孩子 哪有可能做出甚麼愛孩子的舉動"}, {"zh-tw": " I'd like to play you some voices of little girls from the two-and-a-half years of research that we did -- actually, some of the voices are more recent. And these voices will be accompanied by photographs that they took for us of their lives, of the things that they value and care about.", "en": " 我想讓你們聽聽小女孩的心聲 取材自我們過去兩年半的研究材料 事實上有些部分是最近才錄製的 這些聲音將搭配照片一起播放 這些照片是她們拍自己的日常生活 和她們珍惜的事物"}, {"zh-tw": " These are pictures the girls themselves never saw, but they gave to us This is the stuff those reviewers don't know about and aren't listening to and this is the kind of research I recommend to those who want to do humanistic work. Girl 1: Yeah, my character is usually a tomboy.", "en": " 這些照片她們自己也沒看過，卻交給我們 全是那些批評者不了解也不想了解的東西 這個研究題目，我要推薦給 想從事人文研究的諸位 女孩1：對阿，我的個性比較男孩子氣"}, {"zh-tw": " Hers is more into boys. Girl 2: Uh, yeah.", "en": " 她比我還像男生 女孩2：呃，沒錯。"}, {"zh-tw": " Girl 1: We have -- in the very beginning of the whole game, always we do this: we each have a piece of paper; we write down our name, our age -- are we rich, very rich, not rich, poor, medium, wealthy, boyfriends, dogs, pets -- what else -- sisters, brothers, and all those. Girl 2: Divorced -- parents divorced, maybe.", "en": " 女孩1：我們每次...剛開始玩遊戲時會這樣做 每人拿一張紙，寫下自己的名字、年紀 我們有錢嗎？超有錢、不怎麼有錢、窮酸啦、小康啦、家財萬貫啦 男朋友啦、小狗啦、寵物啦..還有什麼?...兄弟姊妹..等等之類的 女孩2：離婚...爸媽離婚，之類的"}, {"zh-tw": " Girl 3: This is my pretend [unclear] one. Girl 4: We make a school newspaper on the computer.", "en": " 女孩3：這個是我想像出來的 女孩4：我們會在電腦上製作校刊"}, {"zh-tw": " Girl 5: For a girl's game also usually they'll have really pretty scenery with clouds and flowers. Girl 6: Like, if you were a girl and you were really adventurous and a real big tomboy, you would think that girls' games were kinda sissy.", "en": " 女孩5：給女生玩的遊戲通常場景都超華麗 又是雲又是花 譬如說，你雖然身為女生偏偏天生愛冒險又非常男孩子氣 你八成會覺得這種女生遊戲太女孩子氣了"}, {"zh-tw": " Girl 7: I run track, I played soccer, I play basketball, and I love a lot of things to do. And sometimes I feel like I can't really enjoy myself unless it's like a vacation, like when I get Mondays and all those days off.", "en": " 女孩6：我跑步、踢足球 也打籃球，我喜歡做的事情很多 有時候我實在開心不起來，除非放假 最好放禮拜一，或者天天放假也不賴"}, {"zh-tw": " Girl 8: Well, sometimes there is a lot of stuff going on because I have music lessons and I'm on swim team -- all this different stuff that I have to do, and sometimes it gets overwhelming. Girl 9: My friend Justine kinda took my friend Kelly, and now they're being mean to me.", "en": " 女孩7：嗯，有時候我好多事情要忙 因為我要學音樂，又是游泳隊隊員 一大堆亂七八糟的事情等著我 有時候實在忙不過來 我朋友賈斯汀 拉攏我朋友凱莉，兩個聯手起來對付我"}, {"zh-tw": " Girl 10: Well, sometimes it gets annoying when your brothers and sisters, or brother or sister, when they copy you and you get your idea first and they take your idea and they do it themselves. Girl 11: Because my older sister, she gets everything and, like, when I ask my mom for something, she'll say, \"No\" -- all the time.", "en": " 女孩8：唉，有時候家裡有兄弟姊妹超煩的 他們會抄襲你的主意，雖然明明是你先想到的 他們偷了你的點子然後自己拿去用 女孩9：都要怪我老姊，她要什麼有什麼 我跟老媽討個東西她就說\"別想\"，每次都這樣"}, {"zh-tw": " But she gives my sister everything. Brenda Laurel: I want to show you, real quickly, just a minute of \"Rockett's Tricky Decision,\" which went gold two days ago.", "en": " 但對我老姊卻有求必應 布蘭妲：我想很快地給各位看一下，一分鐘就好 這個遊戲叫\"洛綺特的難題\"，兩天前才大功告成"}, {"zh-tw": " Let's hope it's really stable. This is the second day in Rockett's life.", "en": " 希望它很穩定 這是洛綺特生活的第二天"}, {"zh-tw": " The reason I'm showing you this is I'm hoping that the scene that I'm going to show you will look familiar and sound familiar, now that you've listened to some girls' voices. And you can see how we've tried to incorporate the issues that matter to them in the game that we've created.", "en": " 我之所以給各位看這個 是希望待會兒秀出來的場景不管看起來 或聽起來都有種熟悉感，尤其各位聽過女孩子的心聲後 各位將明白我們如何把她們關心的問題 融入遊戲中"}, {"zh-tw": " Miko: Hey Rockett! C'mere! Rockett: Hi Miko! What's going on? Miko: Did you hear about Nakilia's big Halloween party this weekend? She asked me to make sure you knew about it.

Miko: I don't think so.", "en": " (影片)蜜可：嗨 洛綺特！過來一下！ 洛綺特：嗨 蜜可！ 怎麼了嗎？ 蜜可：你知道娜其莉周末要辦一個大型萬聖節派對嗎？ 她要我問你知不知道 娜琪莉也邀請魯本參加，不過... 洛綺特：不過什麼？他不來嗎？ 蜜可：我想他不會來了"}, {"zh-tw": " I mean, I heard his band is playing at another party the same night.

BL: OK, so we're going to emotionally navigate.", "en": " 唉，我不確定麥斯會不會邀請我耶 好了，接下來我們讓感情來引導"}, {"zh-tw": " If we were playing the game, that's what we'd do. If at any time during the game we want to learn more about the characters, we can go into this hidden hallway, and I'll quickly just show you the interface.", "en": " 把玩遊戲當作真實人生 假如玩的過程中我們想更了解遊戲主角 我們可以走入這條隱形走廊 我很快地給各位看一下遊戲介面"}, {"zh-tw": " We can, for example, go find Miko's locker and get some more information about her. Oops, I turned the wrong way.", "en": " 例如，我們可以找出蜜可的儲物櫃 獲得一些跟她有關的情報 哎呀，我轉錯邊了"}, {"zh-tw": " But you get the general idea of the product. I wanted to show you the ways, innocuous as they seem, in which we're incorporating what we've learned about girls -- their desires to experience greater emotional flexibility, and to play around with the social complexity of their lives.", "en": " 不過你們應該抓到這個產品的概念了 我向各位展示的這些方法，雖然看似泛泛之談 但裡頭加入了我們對女孩子的理解 她們渴望體驗更細膩的情感變化 遊走於複雜的社交生活之間"}, {"zh-tw": " I want to make the point that what we're giving girls, I think, through this effort, is a kind of validation, a sense of being seen.
