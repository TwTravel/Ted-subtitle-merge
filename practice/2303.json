In Western cultures, when you have cancer, it's as if you disappear in a way.", "en": " 我對癌症一無所知 生活在西方文化 如果你得了癌症 便好像失去自己"}, {"zh-tw": " Your life as a complex human beingis replaced by medical data: Your images, your exams, your lab values, a list of medicines.

These are the \"Can I?\" questions: Can I work while I have cancer? Can I study? Can I make love?Can I be creative? And you wonder, \"What have I doneto deserve this?\" You wonder, \"Can I change somethingabout my lifestyle?\" You wonder, \"Can I do something? Are there any other options?\" And, obviously, doctors arethe good guys in all these scenarios, because they are very professionaland dedicated to curing you.", "en": " 他們未跟你說聲好前 只會問：醫生説了什麼？ 當時我有很多疑問 但是沒有人回答我 這些都是＂可否＂的問題 我有癌症 可否上班？ 可否讀書？可否做愛？可否創作？ 那時覺得不解＂我做了什麼得到這樣的對待？＂ ＂可否改變自己的生活方式？＂ ＂我可否做點什麼？＂ ＂有沒有其他選擇？＂ 很明顯 醫生在這種環境 是最得人心 因為他們非常專業 而且盡心醫病"}, {"zh-tw": " But they also are very usedto having to deal with patients, so I'd say that they sometimeslose the idea that this is torture for you and that you become,literally, a patient -- \"patient\" means \"the one who waits.\" Things are changing, but classically, they tend to not engage you in any wayto learn about your condition, to get your friends and family engaged, or showing you waysin which you can change your lifestyle to minimize the risksof what you're going through. But instead, you're forced there to wait in the hands of a seriesof very professional strangers.", "en": " 但是醫生照顧病人 實在太過熟練 有時忘記了這樣治療 只會折磨你 你變成字面上 病人的稱呼 其實 等如＂一個等待的人＂ 每件事不停在變 但方式守舊 醫生不會讓你知道病情 只讓親朋戚友商量病情 也不會教你如何改善生活方式 減低疾病帶來的風險 反而要我在那裡呆等 任由那幾位陌生的大國手決定"}, {"zh-tw": " While I was in the hospital, I asked for a printed-outpicture of my cancer and I spoke with it.
