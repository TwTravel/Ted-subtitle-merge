And this school, named after the U.K.'s first female doctor, and the surrounding buildings named for Mexican artist Frida Kahlo, Mary Seacole, the Jamaican nurse known as the \"black Florence Nightingale,\" and the English author, Emily Bronte, honor women who fought sexism, racism and ignorance, to pursue their passions to feed their own souls."}, {"zh-tw": "她們沒有顧及任何障礙。就像後面這個標語寫的，“全然無限”她們沒想以其他的方式生活而只是追隨她們的夢想", "en": "They allowed for no obstacles. As the sign said back there, \"without limitations.\" They knew no other way to live than to follow their dreams."}, {"zh-tw": "正因為如此，這四位女士去除了很多障礙她們創造了很多新的機會為成百上千萬的女醫生和女護士們女藝術家和女作家們，她們都追隨了這四位女士。", "en": "And having done so, these women moved many obstacles.

You too can realize your dreams, and then your job is to reach back and to help someone just like you do the same thing."}, {"zh-tw": "歷史證明，無論是你們來自窮人家或來自富人家。你們的成功取決於你們自己的堅韌，你們自己的信心，你們自己的辛勤工作。", "en": "History proves that it doesn't matter whether you come from a council estate or a country estate. Your success will be determined by your own fortitude, your own confidence, your own individual hard work."}, {"zh-tw": "真是這樣。這就是我們所生活的世界的真實情況。你們的命運現在掌握在自己手上。", "en": "That is true. That is the reality of the world that we live in. You now have control over your own destiny."}, {"zh-tw": "但這並不容易。那是一定的。可是你們擁有你們所需要的一切。", "en": "And it won't be easy -- that's for sure.

In the White House, there's the desk that he sits at -- it's called the Resolute desk."}, {"zh-tw": "桌子是用女王陛下“堅決號“船的木料打造的。是維多利亞女王送的。它是我們兩國之間友誼的永久象徵。", "en": "It was built by the timber of Her Majesty's Ship Resolute and given by Queen Victoria. It's an enduring symbol of the friendship between our two nations."}, {"zh-tw": "它的名字，“堅決”，提醒我們要有這樣的風骨不只是領導一個國家，而且要度過一個有意義的人生。我希望在追求你們的夢想時，你們都能保持堅定，向前進而不受限制，發揮你們的才能 -- 因為你們才華橫溢。我們見識過確實有才華。用你們的才華去創建那個理想世界", "en": "And its name, Resolute, is a reminder of the strength of character that's required not only to lead a country, but to live a life of purpose, as well. And I hope in pursuing your dreams, you all remain resolute, that you go forward without limits, and that you use your talents -- because there are many; we've seen them; it's there -- that you use them to create the world as it should be."}, {"zh-tw": "因為我們指望著你們。我們指望著你們每一個人盡你們的全力，做到最好。", "en": "Because we are counting on you.
