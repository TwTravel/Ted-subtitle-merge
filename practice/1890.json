Welcome, I love you.\" And there was something so beautifully African about it to me, this small house with a huge heart in it.", "en": " 我們第一組接到的客人 是一群從美國東岸來的慈善家， 他們在路上對索利說： 「在我們出去看獅子和豹之前， 我們想看看你住的地方。」 後來我們就帶他們到索利家， 這趟慈善家訪視之旅 剛好是在索利的老婆 學英文的時候， 她正學到打開門要說： 「你好，我愛你。 歡迎光臨，我愛你。」 對我來說，非洲人最美的一面就是 這個小房子裡 住著很大的心。"}, {"zh-tw": " Now on the day that Solly saved my life, he was already my hero.

Don't go in there.\" And of course, the crocodile was in the shadows. Now the first thing that you noticewhen a crocodile hits you is the ferocity of the bite.", "en": " 如果你看過恐怖電影， 觀眾會開始七嘴八舌說： 「別過去那，別過去那。」 想當然爾，鱷魚藏在陰影裡。 當鱷魚攻擊你時，你會先注意到 被兇殘咬下的那一口。"}, {"zh-tw": " Wham!

I make an instant decision thatI'll never look at that again.", "en": " 肉被撕裂。 我馬上決定絕不再看第二眼。"}, {"zh-tw": " As I come out of the water, Solly arrives at a deep section, a channel between us. He knows, he sees the state of my leg, he knows that between him and I there is a crocodile, and I can tell you this man doesn'tslow down for one second.", "en": " 我離開水面後， 索利站在 我和鱷魚之間的深水處。 他看到我的腳傷， 知道我和他之間 有一隻鱷魚， 我跟你說，這位男士一秒也沒遲疑，"}, {"zh-tw": " He comes straight into the channel. He wades in to above his waist.", "en": " 在水中筆直走向我， 水深及腰，"}, {"zh-tw": " He gets to me. He grabs me. I'm still in a vulnerable position.", "en": " 他一把抓起我。 我還在極易受傷的位置，"}, {"zh-tw": " He picks me and puts me on his shoulder. This is the other thing about Solly,he's freakishly strong.", "en": " 他把我扛上肩。 這是索利的另一個特點，他壯得嚇人。"}, {"zh-tw": " He turns. He walks me up the bank. He lays me down. He pulls his shirt off.", "en": " 他轉身，帶著我走上岸， 放下我後，索利脫掉身上的衣服"}, {"zh-tw": " He wraps it around my leg, picks me up a second time, walks me to a vehicle, and he's able to get me to medical attention. And I survive.", "en": " 纏上我的腳， 再次扛起我 走向車子， 為我做醫療照護。"}, {"zh-tw": " Now — Now I don't know how many people you know that go into a deep channel of water that they know has a crocodile in it to come and help you, but for Solly, it was as natural as breathing. And he is one amazing example of what I have experienced all over Africa.", "en": " 我活下來了。 我不知道你們認識的人之中，有多少位 願意走下深溝， 而且他們知道裡面有隻鱷魚 還願意來救你， 但是對索利來說，那就像呼吸一樣自然。 我在整個非洲的經歷中， 他是其中一個驚人例子。"}, {"zh-tw": " In a more collective society, we realize from the inside that our own well-being is deeply tied to the well-being of others.

Her name was Elvis.", "en": " 後來，我碰到這位年輕女士。 她的名字是艾維斯（貓王）。"}, {"zh-tw": " In fact, Solly gave her the name Elvis because he said she walked like she was doing the Elvis the pelvis dance. She was born with very badlydeformed back legs and pelvis.", "en": " 其實索利幫牠取這個名字 是因為他說牠走路的時候就像是在跳 貓王的扭臀舞。 牠出生時雙腳和骨盆嚴重變形，"}, {"zh-tw": " She arrived at our reserve from a reserve east of us on her migratory route.

And we would be so excited to be out in the bush and to come across this unusual track.", "en": " 可是五年之後 牠就返家過冬了。 我們會很興奮的深入叢林， 出現在這條特別的小徑上，"}, {"zh-tw": " It looked like an inverted bracket, and we would drop whateverwe were doing and we would follow, and then we would come around the corner, and there she would be with her herd. And that outpouring of emotion from people on our safari trucks as they saw her, it was this sense of kinship.", "en": " 牠看起來就像是一個反向括號， 不管我們手邊在忙什麼，都會放下一切跟著牠， 接著我們會來到角落， 牠就在那裡和象群在一起。 看到牠的時候， 野遊車裡的人們 流露出的情感，就是家人的感覺。"}, {"zh-tw": " And it reminded me that even people who grow up in cities feel a natural connection with the natural world and with animals. And yet still I remained amazedthat she was surviving.", "en": " 牠提醒了我， 即使是在城市長大的人 也會對大自然和動物 自然而然地產生連結。 至今，牠能活下來依然讓我大為驚奇。"}, {"zh-tw": " And then one day we came acrossthem at this small water hole. It was sort of a hollow in the ground.", "en": " 後來有一天，我們在這個小水池裡碰到牠們， 那有點像是地下坑洞。"}, {"zh-tw": " And I watched as the matriarch drank, and then she turned in that beautiful slow motion of elephants, looks like the arm in motion, and she began to make her way up the steep bank. The rest of the herd turned and began to follow.", "en": " 在這位女性領導人喝水時，我看著牠， 接著，牠在緩慢移動的美麗象群中轉過身， 看起來就像手臂正在移動， 牠開始爬上陡坡。 其他象群也轉向跟隨牠。"}, {"zh-tw": " And I watched young Elvis begin to psych herself up for the hill. She got visibly -- ears came forward, she had a full go of it and halfway up, her legs gave way, and she fell backwards.", "en": " 我看著年輕的艾維斯 開始做好準備要爬上山坡。 顯然牠的耳朵向前， 全力衝刺向上到半途， 牠的腳支撐不住，讓牠向後退了。"}, {"zh-tw": " She attempted it a second time, and again, halfway up, she fell backwards. And on the third attempt, an amazing thing happened.", "en": " 牠嘗試第二次， 同樣的在半途牠向後跌坐。 第三次嘗試， 神奇的事情發生了。"}, {"zh-tw": " Halfway up the bank, a young teenage elephant came in behind her, and he propped his trunk underneath her, and he began to shovel her up the bank. And it occurred to me that the rest of the herd was in fact looking after this young elephant.", "en": " 往岸上爬的半途中 一隻壯象前來協助， 用鼻子撐起牠， 然後壯象開始把牠往岸上扔。 這件事提醒了我 其他大象 其實一直在照顧這隻幼象。"}, {"zh-tw": " The next day I watched again as the matriarch broke a branch and she would put it in her mouth, and then she would break a second one and drop it on the ground. And a consensus developed between all of us who were guiding people in that area that that herd was in fact moving slower to accommodate that elephant.", "en": " 隔天我再次看著牠， 這位女領導折斷樹枝， 放進嘴裡， 然後再折斷一次， 丟在地上。 在這個區域導覽的我們 一致認為 象群其實放慢速度 讓這隻小象跟上腳步。"}, {"zh-tw": " What Elvis and the herd taught me caused me to expand my definition of ubuntu, and I believe that in the cathedral of the wild, we get to see the most beautiful parts of ourselves reflected back at us. And it is not only through other people that we get to experience our humanity but through all the creatures that live on this planet.", "en": " 而艾維斯和象群讓我了解 也讓我對烏邦圖有更寬廣的定義， 我相信在荒野的聖壇中， 我們會看見自己最美好的那個部分 回應我們。 我們不只是要透過其他人 感受自己人性的那一面， 而是要透過所有生長在地球上的生物。"}, {"zh-tw": " If Africa has a gift to share, it's a gift of a more collective society. And while it's true that ubuntu is an African idea, what I see is the essence of that value being invented here.", "en": " 如果非洲有一份禮物能分享， 那份禮物就是一個更加聚合的社會。 雖然烏邦圖是非洲的概念， 而我看到的是那份價值觀的本質 也在此創造了。"}, {"zh-tw": " Thank you. Pat Mitchell: So Boyd, we know that you knew President Mandela from early childhood and that you heard the news as we all did today, and deeply distraught and know the tragic loss that it is to the world.", "en": " 謝謝！ 派特．蜜雪兒 (Pat Mitchell)：鮑伊德， 我們知道你在很小的時候 就認識曼德拉總統， 你和我們同時在今天聽到這個消息， 心裡感到十分心煩意亂， 也了解這是全世界不幸的損失。"}, {"zh-tw": " But I just wondered if you wanted to share any additional thoughts, because we know that you heard that news just before coming in to do this session. Boyd Varty: Well thanks, Pat.", "en": " 我好奇的是，你是否想 分享一些想法， 因為我們知道你在這個階段開始前不久 才聽到這個消息。 鮑伊德：謝謝你，派特。"}, {"zh-tw": " I'm so happy because it was time for him to pass on. He was suffering.", "en": " 我替他感到高興，因為也該是時候了， 他一直都在受苦。"}, {"zh-tw": " And so of course there's the mixed emotions. But I just think of so many occurrences like the time he went on the Oprah show and asked her what the show would be about.", "en": " 當然我有很複雜的情緒， 但是我想到很多發生過的事， 像是有一次他上阿普拉秀 問她這個秀會跟什麼有關？"}, {"zh-tw": " And she was like, \"Well, it'll be about you.\" I mean, that's just incredible humility. He was the father of our nation and we've got a road to walk in South Africa.", "en": " 她就說：「嗯，會跟你有關。」 我的意思是，那是多麼讓人難以置性的謙卑。 他是我國之父， 我們在南非還有一段路要走。"}, {"zh-tw": " And everything, they used to call it Madiba magic. You know, he used to go toa rugby match and we would win.", "en": " 每件事，大家都習慣稱為「馬迪巴魔法」。 你知道，他以前都會去參加橄欖球賽，然後我們就會贏。"}, {"zh-tw": " Anywhere he went, things went well. But I think that magic will be with us, and the important thing is that we carry what he stood for.", "en": " 不管他去哪裡，事情都會很順利。 但是我想這個魔法將會與我們同在， 重要的是我們帶著 他所象徵的意義。"}, {"zh-tw": " And so that's what I'm going to try and do, and that's what people all over South Africa are trying to do. PM: And that's what you've done today.BV: Oh, thank you.", "en": " 因此，我會嘗試這麼做， 全南非人也都會如此。 派特：那就是你今天完成的事。鮑伊德：謝謝！"}, {"zh-tw": " PM: Thank you.BV: Thank you.
