A thousand years later,a mammoth died in southern Germany.", "en": " （音樂） 約在四萬三千年以前 一隻年輕的洞熊 死於現今斯洛文尼亞西北邊界的山巒中 一千年後，一頭長毛象死於德國的南部"}, {"zh-tw": " A few centuries after that,a griffon vulture also died in the same vicinity. And we know almost nothingabout how these animals met their deaths, but these different creaturesdispersed across both time and space did share one remarkable fate.", "en": " 幾個世紀過後，一隻禿鷹 也在附近死去 我們對這些動物的死亡原因幾乎一無所知 但這些不同的生物跨越時空和不同地點 卻有著同樣不同凡響的命運"}, {"zh-tw": " After their deaths,a bone from each of their skeletons was crafted by human hands into a flute. Think about that for a second.", "en": " 在牠們死後，身上的骨頭 經由人類的手製成 一隻笛子 想像自己是"}, {"zh-tw": " Imagine you're a caveman,40,000 years ago. You've mastered fire.", "en": " 四萬年前的山頂洞人 很會用火"}, {"zh-tw": " You've built simple tools for hunting. You've learned how to craftgarments from animal skins to keep yourself warm in the winter.", "en": " 也會製造些簡單的狩獵工具 也知道如何用動物皮毛製成衣服 在冬天時保持溫暖"}, {"zh-tw": " What would you choose to invent next? It seems preposterousthat you would invent the flute, a tool that createduseless vibrations in air molecules. But that is exactlywhat our ancestors did.", "en": " 接下來你會想發明什麽？ 發明笛子聽起來很荒謬 只是一種讓空氣分子震盪的無用工具 但這就是我們祖先曾經做的事"}, {"zh-tw": " Now this turns outto be surprisingly common in the history of innovation. Sometimes people invent things because they want to stay aliveor feed their children or conquer the village next door.", "en": " 在人類的發明史中 出乎意料是相當常見的 人們發明的原因 不外乎是為了要求生存或者餵飽孩子 或是攻占隔壁村莊"}, {"zh-tw": " But just as often, new ideas come into the world simply because they're fun. And here's the really strange thing: many of those playfulbut seemingly frivolous inventions ended up sparkingmomentous transformations in science, in politics and society.", "en": " 但很多時候 世界上的一些新發明 僅僅出自於好玩 而真正奇怪的是 很多用於玩樂看似沒用的發明 最後卻能在科學、政治和社會上 產生重大的轉變"}, {"zh-tw": " Take what may be the mostimportant invention of modern times: programmable computers. Now, the standard story is that computersdescend from military technology, since many of the early computerswere designed specifically to crack wartime codesor calculate rocket trajectories.", "en": " 舉一個當今世代最重要的發明 可編程電腦 一般來說電腦一開始沿用軍方科技 早期許多電腦都是專門設計 在戰爭時用來破解密碼或計算火箭運輸軌道"}, {"zh-tw": " But in fact, the originsof the modern computer are much more playful, even musical, than you might imagine. The idea behind the flute, of just pushing air through tubesto make a sound, was eventually modifiedto create the first organ more than 2,000 years ago.", "en": " 但事實上，現代電腦的始祖 起源是因為有趣的活動 非常具有音樂性的 跟你想的不一樣 笛子的發明 僅是透過管子推動空氣來產生聲音而已 改良加工之後成為 兩千多年前的第一個風琴"}, {"zh-tw": " Someone came up with the brilliant ideaof triggering sounds by pressing small levers with our fingers, inventing the first musical keyboard. Now, keyboards evolvedfrom organs to clavichords to harpsichords to the piano, until the middle of the 19th century, when a bunch of inventorsfinally hit on the idea of using a keyboardto trigger not sounds but letters.", "en": " 有人想出了一個能製造出聲音的好主意 藉由我們的手指按壓琴鍵來產生聲音 發明了第一個琴鍵 到現在，琴鍵發展到風琴從翼琴進步衍生到大鍵琴 到今日的鋼琴 直到十九世紀中期 一群發明家終於想到 使用鍵盤敲打出文字而非彈出聲音"}, {"zh-tw": " In fact, the very first typewriter was originally called\"the writing harpsichord.\" Flutes and music ledto even more powerful breakthroughs. About a thousand years ago, at the height of the Islamic Renaissance, three brothers in Baghdaddesigned a device that was an automated organ.", "en": " 事實上，第一台打字機 原名則是「寫字大鍵琴」 笛子加上音樂給生活帶來了更多的轉變 大約一千年以前 在伊斯蘭復興運動的高峰期間 在巴格達的三兄弟設計了一個 即為自動風琴"}, {"zh-tw": " They called it \"the instrumentthat plays itself.\" Now, the instrumentwas basically a giant music box. The organ could be trained to playvarious songs by using instructions encoded by placing pinson a rotating cylinder.", "en": " 他們稱它做「會自己演奏的樂器」 現在看來，那個樂器基本上就是一個大型音樂盒 樂器能自己奏出許多不同樂曲，藉由編碼在圓筒上的點 轉動圓筒，金屬片撥動而產生音樂"}, {"zh-tw": " And if you wanted the machineto play a different song, you just swapped a new cylinder inwith a different code on it. This instrument was the first of its kind.", "en": " 如果你想換一首曲子 只需要換上一個新的編碼過的圓筒就行了 這樂器第一個被發明出來"}, {"zh-tw": " It was programmable. Now, conceptually,this was a massive leap forward.", "en": " 可以編碼的 從概念上來說，這是一個非常大的進步"}, {"zh-tw": " The whole idea of hardware and software becomes thinkable for the first timewith this invention. And that incredibly powerful concept didn't come to us as an instrumentof war or of conquest, or necessity at all.", "en": " 這個發明裡面軟硬體結合的想法 讓人覺得有很大的想像空間 這個不可思議的想像空間 不是為了戰爭或征服而發明 也不是什麼生活必需品"}, {"zh-tw": " It came from the strange delightof watching a machine play music. In fact, the idea of programmable machines was exclusively kept alive by musicfor about 700 years.", "en": " 僅是來自於欣賞音樂盒播放音樂時的美妙樂趣 事實上，可編碼機器的概念 存在於音樂世界中已經有七百多年"}, {"zh-tw": " In the 1700s, music-making machines became the playthingsof the Parisian elite. Showmen used the same coded cylinders to control the physical movementsof what were called automata, an early kind of robot.", "en": " 在十八世紀，能奏出音樂的機器 成了巴黎貴族們的收藏玩物 雜耍藝人使用相同的編碼圓筒 去控制「Automata」機器人的各種動作 就是機器人最早的雛形"}, {"zh-tw": " One of the most famous of those robots was, you guessed it,an automated flute player designed by a brilliant French inventor named Jacques de Vaucanson. And as de Vaucansonwas designing his robot musician, he had another idea.", "en": " 這些機器人中最著名的 各位猜到了嗎?是一個能演奏笛子的機器人 由一位傑出的法國發明家Jacques de Vaucanson 所設計發明的自動發音長笛 當在設計他的機器人音樂家時 他萌生了另外一個想法"}, {"zh-tw": " If you could program a machineto make pleasing sounds, why not program it to weavedelightful patterns of color out of cloth? Instead of using the pins of the cylinderto represent musical notes, they would representthreads with different colors. If you wanted a new patternfor your fabric, you just programmed a new cylinder.", "en": " 如果可以透過編碼讓機器產生令人愉悅的音樂 為什麽不能透過編碼讓它在衣服上編織出色彩斑斕的圖案呢? 原本圓筒上面代表的音符 在圓筒上的點能否試試用不同顏色的線來代替 如果想編織一塊新的樣式 只需要換上新編碼的圓筒"}, {"zh-tw": " This was the first programmable loom. Now, the cylinders were too expensiveand time-consuming to make, but a half century later, another French inventor named Jacquard hit upon the brilliant ideaof using paper-punched cards instead of metal cylinders.", "en": " 第一台自動織布機就此產生 但當時這種圓筒相當昂貴，製造過程也很耗時 但半個世紀之後 另一個名叫 Jacquard 的法國發明家 想到了一個用紙做的「打孔卡」的絕佳點子 來代替金屬圓筒"}, {"zh-tw": " Paper turned out to bemuch cheaper and more flexible as a way of programming the device. That punch card system inspiredVictorian inventor Charles Babbage to create his analytical engine, the first true programmable computer ever designed.", "en": " 紙張的多種用途加上便宜的價格 在編程設備的發展史中幫助很大 打孔卡系統啟發了維多利亞時期的發明家 Charles Babbage 發明了他的第一台分析機器引擎 史上第一台電腦 史無前例的發明"}, {"zh-tw": " And punch cards were usedby computer programmers as late as the 1970s. So ask yourself this question: what really madethe modern computer possible? Yes, the military involvementis an important part of the story, but inventing a computeralso required other building blocks: music boxes, toy robot flute players, harpsichord keyboards, colorful patterns woven into fabric, and that's just a small part of the story.", "en": " 直到二十世紀1970年代末 這些打孔卡仍被電腦程式人員廣泛使用 所以，試想一下 究竟是什麽造就了現代電腦? 沒錯，軍方的介入的確是一個重要因素 但發明一台電腦還需要其他組件 音樂箱 玩具笛子演奏機器人 大鍵琴的鍵盤 彩色圖案編織布 這都是故事的一小部分"}, {"zh-tw": " There's a long list of world-changingideas and technologies that came out of play: public museums, rubber, probability theory, the insurance business and many more. Necessity isn't alwaysthe mother of invention.", "en": " 還有一堆能改變世界的想法和科技 都來自於娛樂 公眾博物館、橡膠球 機率理論、保險業務 許許多多 需要並不總是發明之母"}, {"zh-tw": " The playful state of mindis fundamentally exploratory, seeking out new possibilitiesin the world around us. And that seekingis why so many experiences that started with simpledelight and amusement eventually led usto profound breakthroughs.", "en": " 腦中愛玩的性格才是探索的基礎 在周圍的世界裏，探索那些新的可能 而這種單純探索娛樂的動機 正是許多實驗的開端 最終引領我們成就更大的突破"}, {"zh-tw": " Now, I think this has implicationsfor how we teach kids in school and how we encourage innovationin our workspaces, but thinking about playand delight this way also helps us detect what's coming next. Think about it: if you weresitting there in 1750 trying to figure outthe big changes coming to society in the 19th, the 20th centuries, automated machines, computers, artificial intelligence, a programmable flute entertaining the Parisian elite would have been as powerful a clueas anything else at the time.", "en": " 我認為，這裡面有含有我們要如何在學校教育孩子 如何在我們的工作場所鼓勵創新的含意 而就在我們這樣尋找娛樂和開心的路上 也幫助了我們預測未來會發生的事 想象一下穿越時空回到1750年 十九世紀、二十世紀當時的社會 試想了解當時即將來臨的改變 那些自動機器、電腦 人工智能 自動演奏的笛子 為了娛樂巴黎上等社會的 就是一個非常強而有力的線索證明"}, {"zh-tw": " It seemed like an amusement at best, not useful in any serious way, but it turned out to bethe beginning of a tech revolution that would change the world. You'll find the future wherever people are having the most fun.", "en": " 發明看起來也許只適用於娛樂 沒有什麽正經的用途 但最後確成為改變世界科技革命的開端 娛樂帶給人們未來的發展無限可能"}], "title": "Steven Johnson How Play Leads To Great Inventions"}
