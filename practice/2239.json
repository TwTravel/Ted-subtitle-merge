This project has been very modestly fundedat about a million dollars a year, and the kind of bang you can get for your buck in terms of leveraginga criminal justice system that could function if it were properlytrained and motivated and led, and these countries, especially a middle class that is seeing that there's really no future with this total instability andtotal privatization of security I think there's an opportunity,a window for change.", "en": " 我們看到針對性暴力的起訴， 增加了十倍之多， 這項計畫的資金算是很節制，一年大概需要一百萬美金， 但這類投資非常值得。 若有適當地訓練、激勵和領導， 能將犯罪司法系統建立起來，發揮功能。 而且這些國家，尤其是中產階級， 因為不安穩的情勢和完全私人化的保全 而看不到未來的那些地方， 現在有了一個轉變的機會。"}, {"zh-tw": " CA: But to make this happen, you haveto look at each part in the chain -- the police, who else? GH: So that's the thing about law enforcement, it starts out with the police, they're the front endof the pipeline of justice, but they hand if off to the prosecutors, and the prosecutors hand it off to the courts, and the survivors of violence have to be supported by social services all the way through that. So you have to do an approach that pulls that all together.", "en": " CA：但要落實這些，你需要注意每個環節 警察、……還有呢？ 講者：執法 從警方開始， 他們在司法的最前線， 將罪犯送交至檢察官手中， 檢察官把他們交給法庭， 而暴力倖存者 需要社會服務的支持， 所以你必須有個方法把這些事情串在一起。"}, {"zh-tw": " In the past, there's been a little bitof training of the courts, but they get crappy evidence from the police, or a little police intervention that has to do with narcotics or terrorism but nothing to do with treatingthe common poor person with excellent law enforcement, so it's about pulling that all together, and you can actually have peoplein very poor communities experience law enforcement like us, which is imperfect in our own experience, for sure, but boy, is it a great thing to sensethat you can call 911 and maybe someone will protect you. CA: Gary, I think you've done a spectacular job of bringing this to the world's attention in your book and right here today.", "en": " 過去，法庭的訓練很少， 他們又從警察那邊拿到爛證據， 或是有優良的執法系統， 有一些警力介入毒品或恐怖主義， 但是卻對普通的窮人無所作為。 所以重點是一切結合在一起， 然後讓極度貧窮的社區的人們 也像我們一樣有執法單位的保護。 雖然在我們的經驗裡，他們並不完美。 但是，你可以試著體會，打911，就有人來保護你， 是一件很棒的事。 CA：嘉理，我覺得你在書上和在這裡 喚起了全世界的注意， 你做了一件了不起的工作，"}, {"zh-tw": " Thanks so much.
