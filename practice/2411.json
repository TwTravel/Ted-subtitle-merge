OK, most of you.", "en": " 認為１號詩是人寫的請舉手， 好的，你們大部分都是。"}, {"zh-tw": " Hands up if you think Poem 2was written by a human. Very brave of you, because the first one was writtenby the human poet William Blake.", "en": " 認為２號詩是人寫的請舉手， 你們很勇敢， 因為第一首詩是由詩人William Blake所寫，"}, {"zh-tw": " The second one was written by an algorithm that took all the languagefrom my Facebook feed on one day and then regenerated it algorithmically, according to methods that I'll describea little bit later on. So let's try another test.", "en": " 第二首詩是由一個演算法所寫出來的， 這裡所有的文法是從我臉書裡一天灌進去的， 然後，用演算法重新製作出來的， 關於方法我稍後會提到一些。 我們來做另一個測驗，"}, {"zh-tw": " Again, you haven't got ages to read this, so just trust your gut.

Alan Turing believed that ifa computer was able to have a to have a text-basedconversation with a human, with such proficiencysuch that the human couldn't tell whether they are talkingto a computer or a human, then the computer can be saidto have intelligence. So in 2013, my friendBenjamin Laird and I, we created a Turing testfor poetry online.", "en": " 「圖靈測試」在1950年，由Alan Turing做第一次發表， 是為了回答一個問題： 「電腦會思考嗎？」 Alan Turing相信，如果電腦能夠 和人類進行一場流暢的以文字交流， 結果讓人無法分辨 對方是人還是一台電腦， 那麼這台電腦可以被稱呼為擁有人工智慧。 所以在2013年，我的朋友Benjamin Laird和我， 我們創造了一個詩的線上圖靈測試程式，"}, {"zh-tw": " It's called bot or not, and you can go and play it for yourselves.

Well, Turing said that if a computercould fool a human 30 percent of the timethat it was a human, then it passes the Turing testfor intelligence.

Hands up if you think Poem 2was written by a human.", "en": " 認為１號詩是人寫的請舉手， 認為２號詩是人寫的請舉手，"}, {"zh-tw": " Whoa, that's a lot more people. So you'd be surprised to find that Poem 1 was written by the veryhuman poet Gertrude Stein.", "en": " 哇！多很多人！ 你會很驚訝地發現， １號詩由一位純正的人類詩人Gertrude Stein所寫的，"}, {"zh-tw": " And Poem 2 was generatedby an algorithm called RKCP. Now before we go on, let me describevery quickly and simply, how RKCP works.", "en": " 而２號詩是一個叫RKCP演算法所創造的， 在我們要繼續以前，讓我簡單快速描述一下 RKCP是如何運作的。"}, {"zh-tw": " So RKCP is an algorithmdesigned by Ray Kurzweil, who's a director of engineering at Google and a firm believerin artificial intelligence. So, you give RKCP a source text, it analyzes the source text in orderto find out how it uses language, and then it regenerates language that emulates that first text.", "en": " RKCP是Ray Kurzweil所設計的演算法， 他是一位谷歌的工程師主管， 也是一位人工智慧的堅定支持者。 那麼，你給 RKCP一個來源文字， 為了找出要如何使用這個語言，它會分析來源文字， 然後，它會重新創造一段話來模仿源文字。"}, {"zh-tw": " So in the poem we just saw before, Poem 2, the one that you allthought was human, it was fed a bunch of poems by a poet called Emily Dickinson it looked at the way she used language, learned the model, and then it regenerated a modelaccording to that same structure. But the important thing to know about RKCP is that it doesn't know the meaningof the words it's using.", "en": " 所以，我們剛剛看到的詩， 你們認為是人類寫的２號詩， 它被灌入了很多一位名叫Emily Dickinson詩人的詩， 它取用了這位詩人的語言， 學習她的模式， 然後它依據同樣的結構重製一首詩出來。 但我們對RKCP最需要了解的是， 它不明白它自己用的文字意義，"}, {"zh-tw": " The language is just raw material, it could be Chinese,it could be in Swedish, it could be the collected languagefrom your Facebook feed for one day. It's just raw material.", "en": " 語言只是它的原料， 它可以是中文，瑞典文， 它可以是你臉書上一天的文字。 它就只是個原料而已。"}, {"zh-tw": " And nevertheless, it's ableto create a poem that seems more humanthan Gertrude Stein's poem, and Gertrude Stein is a human. So what we've done here is,more or less, a reverse Turing test.", "en": " 除此之外，它還有辦法寫一首 比Gertrude Stein寫的還要更有人味的詩， 但Gertrude Stein才是人啊... 所以，我們剛剛做的差不多就是，反向圖靈測試。"}, {"zh-tw": " So Gertrude Stein, who's a human,is able to write a poem that fools a majorityof human judges into thinking that it was written by a computer. Therefore, according to the logicof the reverse Turing test, Gertrude Stein is a computer.", "en": " 所以Gertrude Stein這位人類， 可以寫出讓大部分人誤認為是電腦寫出來的詩。 所以，根據圖靈測試的邏輯， Gertrude Stein這人是個電腦．．．"}, {"zh-tw": " Feeling confused? I think that's fair enough. So far we've had humansthat write like humans, we have computers that writelike computers, we have computers that write like humans, but we also have,perhaps most confusingly, humans that write like computers.", "en": " 感覺很困惑嗎？ 我認為這情有可原。 目前為止，我們有人可以寫出像是人寫出的詩、 我們有電腦可以寫出像是電腦寫出的詩、 我們有電腦可以寫出像是人寫出的詩， 但我們同時也有會讓我們搞混寫詩像電腦的人。"}, {"zh-tw": " So what do we take from all of this? Do we take that William Blakeis somehow more of a human than Gertrude Stein? Or that Gertrude Stein is moreof a computer than William Blake? These are questionsI've been asking myself for around two years now, and I don't have any answers. But what I do have are a bunch of insights about our relationship with technology.", "en": " 所以，我們從這裏面了解到甚麼呢？ 我們會認為William Blake 比Gertrude Stein更像是個人嗎？ 或者Gertrude Stein比William Blake更像是個電腦？ 這兩年來， 我一直在問我自己， 但我沒有任何答案， 但我真的有領悟到很多有關於 我們與科技的關係。"}, {"zh-tw": " So my first insight is that,for some reason, we associate poetry with being human. So that when we ask,\"Can a computer write poetry?\" we're also asking, \"What does it mean to be human and how do we put boundariesaround this category? How do we say who or whatcan be part of this category?\" This is an essentiallyphilosophical question, I believe, and it can't be answeredwith a yes or no test, like the Turing test.", "en": " 所以，我的第一個領悟是， 為了一些原因，我們把人與詩結合一起， 所以，當我們問，＂電腦會寫詩嗎？＂ 我們也在問， 人的定義是什麼？ 我們要如何界定、分類呢？ 我們要如何分辨誰或是東西是歸於哪一類？＂ 我相信，本質上這是一道哲學的問題， 而且，這不是像圖靈測試是個 對或錯的測試，"}, {"zh-tw": " I also believe that Alan Turingunderstood this, and that when he devisedhis test back in 1950, he was doing itas a philosophical provocation. So my second insight is that,when we take the Turing test for poetry, we're not really testingthe capacity of the computers because poetry-generating algorithms, they're pretty simple and have existed,more or less, since the 1950s.", "en": " 我也相信， Alan Turing在1950年發明這個理論時，也了解這一點， 他當時引發了一個哲學上的爭議。 我的第二個領悟是，當我們在為詩做圖靈測試時， 我們並不是真的在測試電腦的能力， 因為用演算法作詩相當簡單， 而且它們大約在1950年代早就已經存在了。"}, {"zh-tw": " What we are doing with the Turingtest for poetry, rather, is collecting opinions about whatconstitutes humanness. So, what I've figured out, we've seen this when earlier today, we say that William Blakeis more of a human than Gertrude Stein.", "en": " 我們現在為詩做的圖靈測試， 反而，比較像是在收集甚麼是構成人性的條件。 所以，我發現， 稍早我們今天看到的， 我們說William Blake 比Gertrude Stein更像個人，"}, {"zh-tw": " Of course, this doesn't meanthat William Blake was actually more human or that Gertrude Steinwas more of a computer. It simply means that the categoryof the human is unstable.", "en": " 當然，這不代表 William Blake比較有人性 或者Gertrude Stein比較像電腦。 這只能單純的說明，對人類的界定是不穩定的。"}, {"zh-tw": " This has led me to understand that the human is not a cold, hard fact. Rather, it is somethingthat's constructed with our opinions and something that changes over time.", "en": " 這讓我明白了一件事， 就是人性不是冷的、死板的事實， 反倒是一種由我們的意見所構成的東西， 而這個東西會隨著時間而改變。"}, {"zh-tw": " So my final insight is thatthe computer, more or less, works like a mirrorthat reflects any idea of a human that we show it. We show it Emily Dickinson, it gives Emily Dickinson back to us.", "en": " 所以我最後的領悟是， 電腦，或多或少只是 一面反映我們輸入進去的人類思想的鏡子。 我們向它展示Emily Dickinson， 它僅是模仿Emily Dickinson給我們，"}, {"zh-tw": " We show it William Blake, that's what it reflects back to us. We show it Gertrude Stein, what we get back is Gertrude Stein.", "en": " 我們向它展示William Blake， 它就回應William Blake給我們的， 我們向它展示Gertrude Stein， 我們得到的回應僅是Gertrude Stein。"}, {"zh-tw": " More than any other bit of technology, the computer is a mirror that reflectsany idea of the human we teach it. So I'm sure a lot of you have been hearing a lot about artificialintelligence recently.", "en": " 還有其他更多的科技也是， 電腦只是我們教它甚麼它就反應甚麼的一面鏡子。 所以，我確定你們大部分人都曾聽過 很多有關人工智慧的事情。"}, {"zh-tw": " And much of the conversation is, can we build it? Can we build an intelligent computer? Can we build a creative computer? What we seem to be asking over and over is can we build a human-like computer? But what we've seen just now is that the humanis not a scientific fact, that it's an ever-shifting,concatenating idea and one that changes over time. So that when we beginto grapple with the ideas of artificial intelligence in the future, we shouldn't only be asking ourselves, \"Can we build it?\" But we should also be asking ourselves, \"What idea of the humando we want to have reflected back to us?\" This is an essentially philosophical idea, and it's one that can't be answeredwith software alone, but I think requires a momentof species-wide, existential reflection.", "en": " 而大部分的對話就類似： 「我們該建造它嗎？」 「我們可以建立一個智慧型電腦嗎？」 「我們可以建立一個創造型電腦嗎？」 我們一次又一次的被問到， 我們可以建立一個類似人類的電腦嗎？ 但就我們剛剛看到的， 人類不是一個科學事實， 人類是一個會不斷地變化、串聯想法、 隨時間改變的物種。 所以，當我們開始要努力克服 未來人工智慧的這個想法時， 我們不應該只問我們自己， 「我們可以建造它嗎？」 我們還得問我們自己， 「我們希望可以得到甚麼樣的人性回應？」 這絕對是個哲學想法， 而且不是單靠軟體就可以回答出來的， 但我認為，這需要一個各類物種共存的反應時刻，"}, {"zh-tw": " Thank you.", "en": " 謝謝各位。"}], "title": "Oscar Schwartz Can A Computer Write Poetry"}
