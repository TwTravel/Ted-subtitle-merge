Because I really think, when I look back at how I actually ended up in this accident, technology played a big role in that.", "en": " 但我今天要向大家說的 是我們可以利用科技 使這些偶然經常發生 因爲我真的認爲，當我回顧我怎麽會來到這一步時 在這偶然裏，科技扮演了很重要的角色"}, {"zh-tw": " So, what I'd like to do today is tell you a little bit about myself, because I'd like to put in context what I'm going to tell you. And I think you will see why the two greatest passions in my life today are children and education.", "en": " 所以我今天想做的就是和各位聊一下關於我的事 因爲我想要大家先了解我等一下要說的背景 你們也就會了解爲什麽我今天生命中最熱衷的兩件事 就是兒童和教育"}, {"zh-tw": " And once I put that in context, I'd like to tell you a little bit about technology: why I believe technology is a tremendous enabler; a very powerful tool to help address some of these challenges. Then, about the initiative that Chris mentioned, that we decided to launch at AMD that we call 50x15.", "en": " 我説明背景后 想告訴你們關於科技的一些小事 爲什麽我相信科技是一個巨大的推動力 是一個對應這些挑戰的強而有力的工具， 其次是關於克裏斯所提的倡議 就是我們AMD打算推出的50到15"}, {"zh-tw": " And then I'll come back to the beginning, and tell you a little bit more -- hopefully convince you -- that I believe that in today's world, it is really important for business leaders not only to have an idea of what their business is all about, but to have a passion for something that is meaningful. So, with that in mind, first of all let me tell you, I'm one of five children. I'm the oldest, the other four are women.", "en": " 然後我再回歸前面說的 再多告訴你們一點，希望能說服你們 就是我相信在當下 對商譠領袖非常重要的 不只是要了解自己的生意 更要有做些有意義的事的熱情 記得這個后，先讓我告訴你們 我父母共有五個子女，我是長子，其他四人是女生"}, {"zh-tw": " So I grew up in a family of women. I learned a lot about how to deal with that part of the world.", "en": " 所以我在女人堆中長大 我學到許多如何處理那個世界的方法 笑"}, {"zh-tw": " And, as you can imagine, if you can picture this: I was born in a very small village in Mexico, in, unfortunately, very poor surroundings, and my parents did not have a college education.

My parents were fanatics about learning, and I'll come back to that a little bit later.", "en": " 這也可以讓你們了解 我的父母是多麽的重視教育 我父母非常熱衷學習 關於這，我以後再來説"}, {"zh-tw": " But one of the things that exposed me early to learning, and a tremendous curiosity that was instilled in me as a child, was through a technology which is on the screen -- is a Victrola. My father found that in a junkyard, and was able to repair it and make it work. And somehow -- to this day, I frankly don't know how he was so aware of what was going on in the world -- but, by inviting me to sit down with him when I was only a few years old, and playing records in this Victrola by Mozart, and he would tell me how Mozart was the most romantic of all the classic composers ever, and how Claire de Lune, which was one of his favorites, was a real exposure to me to classical music.", "en": " 但最早讓接觸學習的 也在我幼小的心靈種下強大好奇心的 是透過銀幕上的這個科技，一個留聲機-維克多拉 我父親在廢物堆中找到的 他把它修好能用了 其實直到今天，我還是不懂他那時怎麽對 世界上的事這麽了解 可是我六嵗時，他要我和他一起坐下 用這維克多拉留聲機播放莫札特的唱片，並告訴我 莫札特是所有古典音樂作曲家裏，最羅曼蒂克的 以及月光奏鳴曲是他最喜歡的曲子之一 讓我真的接觸古典音樂"}, {"zh-tw": " He explained to me about Johann Strauss, and how he created the waltzes that became so famous in the world.

And not tough in the sense that most people think of, where your parents yell at you or hit you or whatever.", "en": " 還有，從這經驗中記取的 另外一件重要事，就是 別人問我說 你小時父母對你怎樣？ 我總是回答說他們對我非常嚴厲 並且不是大家所想象的嚴厲 像父母罵你或打你之類"}, {"zh-tw": " They were tough in the sense that, as I grew up, both my mother and father would always say to me, it's really important that you always remember two things.

Now, I don't know how many of you have ever done that with your kids, but if you do, please trust me, it's the most pressure you can put on a child, to say -- -- we trust you that you will always do the right thing.", "en": " 第二件事他們說的是：我們相信你 不論你在哪裏，或要去哪裏 你一定會做正確的事 我不知道你們有哪些人有對孩子們說這些 但如果你有，請相信我， 這是你可以給孩子的最大的壓力 笑 我們相信你一定會做正確的事"}, {"zh-tw": " When I was out with my friends drinking beer, I always was very aware of those words -- -- and very careful. One of the things that has happened with technology is that it can only be helpful if it is useful, of course, but it can only be helpful too if it's accessible, and it can only be helpful if it's affordable. And in today's world, being useful, affordable and accessible is not necessarily what happens in a lot of the technology that is done today.", "en": " 當我和朋友出去和啤酒 我縂是想到這幾個字 笑 而且非常小心。科技引發的事之一 不必提，就是如果有用處，才會有用。 但是也只有能接觸到，才有用。 也只有買得起，才有用 然而在今天的世界，有用，買得起，買得到， 並不見得會發生 在今天的科技裏"}, {"zh-tw": " So, one of our passions in our company, and now one of my personal passions, is to be able to really work hard at making the technology useful, accessible and affordable. And to me, that is very, very critical.", "en": " 所以我們公司熱衷的事之一 也是我個人熱衷的，就是能夠努力工作 使科技能夠有用，買得到，和買得起 對我來説，這是非常要緊的"}, {"zh-tw": " Now, technology has changed a lot since the Victrola days.

So, when you look at that, we said, well, we would like to, then, enable that a little bit. We would like to create an initiative.", "en": " 如果我們能更密切的連接人和想法 雖然你們已見過今天市面上，各式各樣的產品 對我來説，關鍵是 這些產品當中，有哪些能夠讓人們連接得有用處 很容易的取得 也能買得起 不論一個人的經濟狀況如何 他們都有機會取得這科技 這樣當你看到這一點，我們說，好，我們想要 再加強些，製造一個動力"}, {"zh-tw": " And a couple of years ago at AMD, we came up with this idea of saying, what if we create this initiative we call 50x15, where we are going to aim, that by the year 2015, half of the world will be connected to the Internet so that people and ideas can get connected. We knew we couldn't do it by ourselves, and by no means did we ever intend to imply that we at AMD could do it alone.", "en": " 幾年前，在AMD 我們提出一個想法， 如果我們提出一個倡議叫做50乘15 我們目標是2015年時 全世界一半都可以上網 人們和想法可以連接 我們知道只靠自己是不可能的 也絕對沒有想暗示我們AMD可以獨自完成。"}, {"zh-tw": " We always felt that this was something that could be done through partnerships with governments, industry, educational institutions, a myriad of other companies and, frankly, even competitors. So, it is really a rather lofty initiative, if you want to think that way, but we felt that we had to put a real stake up in the years ahead, that was bold enough and courageous enough that it would force us all to think of ways to do things differently.", "en": " 我們一直覺得這件事可以藉由 和政府，產業界， 教育機構，以及其他各式各樣的公司，甚至與競爭對手合作 所以説不定你們會覺得 這是一個蠻崇高的提議 但我們覺得我們必須對未來下這賭注 要夠大膽和勇敢 才會令我們全部想出一些不同的作法"}, {"zh-tw": " And I'll come back to that in a minute, because I think the results so far have been remarkable, and I can only anticipate and get real excited about what I think is going to happen in the next eight years, while we get to the 2015 initiative. Where are we today? That's year by year. This comes from our friends at Gapminder.com.", "en": " 我等一會兒再回來談這一點，因爲我認爲 到目前爲止，成果已很驚人。 我只能很興奮的期待 在到2015的未來八年， 我們抵達2015唱議時，會發生什麽事 我們今天在哪裏？ 這一年一年的比較，是從我們的朋友“提醒差距”的網站來的"}, {"zh-tw": " Those of you who've never looked at their website, you should look at it. It's really impressive. And you can see how the Internet penetration has changed over the years. And so when we gave ourselves this scorecard to say well, where are we related to our goal towards 2015, the thing that becomes apparent is three pieces.", "en": " 如果你從沒去過他們的網站 你該去看看，真的很了不起。你可以看到 近幾年來網路的普及情形 所以我們給自己打分數時，可以說 看看我們達到2015的目標路上 很明顯的可以看到三件事"}, {"zh-tw": " One is the Western world, defined mostly by Western Europe and the United States, has made an awful lot of progress. The connectivity in these parts of the world are really truly phenomenal and continue to increase.", "en": " 一個是由西歐和美國所構成的 西方世界 有飛快的進步 在這地區的聯結網 真是驚人，並繼續增加"}, {"zh-tw": " As a matter of fact, we think reaching 100 percent is very doable, even before the 2015 timeframe. In other parts of emerging countries, such as India and China, the progress has been good -- has been solid, has been good. But in places that are not as developed, places like Africa, Latin America and other places in the world, the progress has been rather slow. As a matter of fact, I was just recently visiting South Africa. I had the opportunity to have a discussion with President Mbeki, and one of the things that we talked about is, what is it that's keeping this connectivity goal from moving ahead faster? And one of the reasons is, in South Africa, it costs 100 dollars a month to have a broadband connectivity.", "en": " 事實上我們認爲在2015年之前， 都有能力達到百分之一百。在其他發展中的國家 如印度和中國，進展也不錯 蠻穩固，蠻不錯。但在沒那麽開發的地區裏 像非洲，南美洲以及世界上其他地方 進展的很慢。其實 我最近才訪問過南非 有機會和姆貝基總統討論過 我們談論的事情之一，就是 到底有那些事不讓聯網目標更快達到？ 其中之一的答案就是在南非 一個月要一百美金才有寬頻上網"}, {"zh-tw": " It is impossible, even in the United States, for that cost, to be able to enable the connectivity that we're all trying to reach. So, we talked about ways in which perhaps one could partner to be able to bring the cost of this technology down.", "en": " 這個價格，即時在美國也不可能 達成我們想要的目標 因此我們討論要怎樣合作 才能降低這科技的價格"}, {"zh-tw": " So, when you look at this chart, you look at the very last -- it's a logarithmic chart on a horizontal scale -- you look at the very end: we've got quite a long way to go to get to the 2015 goal of 50 percent. But we're excited in our company; we're motivated.", "en": " 所以當你們看到這表格， 看最後一項，是平行的對數圖 請看最後面 我們距離在2015年達到百分之50的目標還有一段路 但我們公司全員都很興奮，我們受到很大激勵"}, {"zh-tw": " We really think it's a phenomenal driver of things, to force us to do things differently, and we look forward to being able to actually, working with so many partners around the world, to be able to reach that goal. Now, one of the things I'd like to explain [about] 50x15, which I think is really critical, is that it is not a charity.", "en": " 我們真的認爲這是一個驚人的推手 迫使我們用不同方式做事，也期待能夠 和全世界這麽多的夥伴合作 來達到目標 現在我來解釋一下50到15的關鍵之一 我覺得非常重要的，就是它不是慈善工作"}, {"zh-tw": " It is actually a business venture. Let's take a small segment of this, of this unconnected world, and call it the education market.", "en": " 其實是生意上的投資 我們來看這尚未聯網的世界的一小部分 把它稱作教育市場"}, {"zh-tw": " When you look at elementary-school children, we have hundreds and hundreds of millions of children around the world that could benefit tremendously from being able to be connected to the Internet.

This is really a business venture, one that addresses a very challenging segment of the market.", "en": " 我們提出這項提議時，從一開始就說得很清楚， 這不是慈善事業。 而是一個投資創業 對應這市場裏很有挑戰性的部分。"}, {"zh-tw": " Because what we have learned in the last three years is that this segment of the market, whether it's education or under-developed nations, either way, it's a segment that demands incredibly high quality, incredibly high reliability, tremendous low cost and access, and a lot of challenges that frankly, without actually doing it, it would be very difficult to understand, and I'll explain that in just a minute. It is an initiative that is focused on simple, accessible and human-centric solutions.", "en": " 因爲我們過去三年裏學到的。 就是在這部分的市場，不論是教育 或是未開發國家，兩者都是要求 難以置信的高品質，難以置信的高可靠度 極度的低成本和取得，以及非常多的挑戰。 實在說來，沒有真正做， 很難了解 我等一下會解釋這一點 這個提議的焦點在簡單，取得，和人本的解決方法。"}, {"zh-tw": " What we mean by that is, you know, frankly, the PC was invented in 1980, roughly speaking more or less, and for 20-odd years, it hasn't changed. It is still, in most places, a gray or black box, and it looks the same.", "en": " 我們的意思是 大家都知道，電腦大概是1980年左右發明的。 這二十多年來，沒有改變 在很多地方看來一樣，還是一個黑色或灰色的盒子"}, {"zh-tw": " And frankly -- and I know that sometimes I offend some of my customers when I say this, but I truly mean it -- if you could take the name of the computer off the top of it, it would be very difficult to judge who made it, because they're all highly commoditized but they're all different. So, there has not been a human-centric approach to addressing this segment of the market, so we really believe it is critical to think of it.", "en": " 老實說，有時當我這麽說，得罪了一些客人 但我真的是這意思。 如果你把電腦上面的牌子去掉 很難断定是誰做的。 因爲它們都高度商品化，但又都不一樣 所以到目前為止，還沒有以人爲中心的做法。 來處理這方面的市場 所以我們任為考慮到這點非常重要"}, {"zh-tw": " It reminded me a lot of the talk we heard this morning, about this operating room machinery that was designed specifically for Africa. We're talking about something very similar here.", "en": " 也提醒我今天早上我們聼到的 這個特別為非洲做的手術室機器 和我們在這裡說的一樣"}, {"zh-tw": " And it has to be based on a geo-sensitive approach. What I mean by that is that in some parts of the world, the government plays a key role in the development of technology.", "en": " 必須以關注地理位置為基礎 我的意思是世界上有些地方 的政府對科技發展有扮演很關鍵的腳色。"}, {"zh-tw": " In other parts, it doesn't. In other parts of the world, you have an infrastructure that allows for manufacturing to take place.", "en": " 有些地方則沒有 世界上有些地方有基礎設施 可以發展生産"}, {"zh-tw": " In other parts, it doesn't. And then we have to be sensitive about how this technology can be developed and put into action in those regions. And the last piece, which is really important -- and this is an opinion that we have, not shared by many, this is one where we seem to stand alone, on this one -- is that we really believe that the greatest success of this initiative can come by fostering local, integrated, end-to-end ecosystems.", "en": " 有些地方則沒有，我們必須敏感些 注意要怎樣開發這些技術 能在這些地區實用 最後非常重要的一點 是還沒有獲得許多人支持的意見 好像只有是我們自己在主張的 就是我們真的相信這提案要能成功 必須將從頭到尾的生態環境融入當地。"}, {"zh-tw": " What I mean by that, and let me use this example, the country of South Africa, because I was just there, therefore I'm a little bit familiar with some of the challenges they have. It's a country of 45 million people. It's an economy that's emerging.", "en": " 我的意思是，舉個例 南非這國家，因爲我曾到過。 所以我稍微了解他們所面臨的一些挑戰 這國家有四千五百萬人，是新興經濟"}, {"zh-tw": " It's beginning to grow tremendously.

And to my surprise, I learned in South Africa they have 18 dialects, I always thought they only had two -- English and Afrikaans -- but it turns out they have 18 dialects.
