I didn't come from the elites.", "en": " 我有很多種類似的經歷， 在我作為耶魯大學法學生的開始幾年。 因為，儘管外表是這樣，我其實是一名文化局外人。 我並不來自菁英階層。"}, {"zh-tw": " I didn't come from the Northeastor from San Francisco. I came from a southern Ohio steel town, and it's a town that's reallystruggling in a lot of ways, ways that are indicativeof the broader struggles of America's working class.", "en": " 我並不來自東北部或者舊金山。 我來自南部俄亥俄的一座鋼鐵城， 那是一座在很多方面都存在掙扎的城市， 象徵著更廣層面上的 美國工薪階層的掙扎。"}, {"zh-tw": " Heroin has moved in, killing a lot of people, people I know. Family violence, domestic violence,and divorce have torn apart families.", "en": " 海洛英的進入， 殺害了很多人，很多我認識的人。 家庭暴力和離婚摧毀了很多家庭。"}, {"zh-tw": " And there's a very uniquesense of pessimism that's moved in. Think about rising mortality ratesin these communities and recognize thatfor a lot of these folks, the problems that they're seeing are actually causing rising death ratesin their own communities, so there's a very real sense of struggle.", "en": " 在那裡還瀰漫著一種很獨特的悲觀情緒。 想想在這些社區中上升的死亡率， 並且知道這當中很多人， 他們眼中所看到的問題 就是促使他們的社區死亡率上升的真實原因， 他們會由此產生一種真實的掙扎感。"}, {"zh-tw": " I had a very front-row seatto that struggle.

Even if you don't give into that hopelessness, even if you think, let's say, that your choices matterand you want to make the good choices, you want to do betterfor yourself and for your family, it's sometimes hardto even know what those choices are when you grow upin a community like I did.", "en": " 這是一個很重大的問題。 即使你不對絕望屈服， 即使你認為，比如說， 你的選擇很要緊，而且你想要做出好的選擇， 你想要為了自己、為了家人做得更好， 有時候你很難知道到底有哪些選擇， 尤其當你成長在我成長的這種社區中。"}, {"zh-tw": " I didn't know, for example, that you had to goto law school to be a lawyer. I didn't know that elite universities,as research consistently tells us, are cheaper for low-income kids because these universitieshave bigger endowments, can offer more generous financial aid.", "en": " 我不知道，舉例子， 你需要去法學院才能成為一名律師。 我不知道那些精英學校，就如研究一貫地告訴我們， 對低收入家庭的孩子會更加便宜， 因為這些大學擁有比別的學校更大的捐款， 能夠提供更加慷慨的助學金。"}, {"zh-tw": " I remember I learned this when I got the financial aid letterfrom Yale for myself, tens of thousands of dollarsin need-based aid, which is a term I had never heard before.
