But I'm actually not here to talk about fiction.", "en": " 我寫驚悚科幻小說 所以如果我談到「殺手機器人」 你可能會覺得是這樣的東西 但事實上我不是來這裡談論小說的"}, {"zh-tw": " I'm here to talk about very real killer robots, autonomous combat drones. Now, I'm not referring to Predator and Reaper drones, which have a human making targeting decisions.", "en": " 我是來這裡談論真正的殺手機器人 自主的無人戰機 我的意思不是掠奪者或是收割者無人戰機 由人類來決定目標"}, {"zh-tw": " I'm talking about fully autonomous robotic weapons that make lethal decisions about human beings all on their own. There's actually a technical term for this: lethal autonomy.", "en": " 我說的是全自動的機械武器 能有自主性的對人類做出致命性的決策 不倚靠人類 這有個專門術語：致命自主"}, {"zh-tw": " Now, lethally autonomous killer robots would take many forms -- flying, driving, or just lying in wait. And actually, they're very quickly becoming a reality.", "en": " 致命性自主殺手機器人 有多種模式－飛行、陸行 或只是待命 事實上它們很快就要問世了"}, {"zh-tw": " These are two automatic sniper stations currently deployed in the DMZ between North and South Korea. Both of these machines are capable of automatically identifying a human target and firing on it, the one on the left at a distance of over a kilometer.", "en": " 這是兩座自動狙擊台 目前部署在南北韓非軍事區 這兩台機器都是自動的 能夠辨識人類的位置並開火射擊 左邊這台能瞄準超過一公里"}, {"zh-tw": " Now, in both cases, there's still a human in the loop to make that lethal firing decision, but it's not a technological requirement. It's a choice. And it's that choice that I want to focus on, because as we migrate lethal decision-making from humans to software, we risk not only taking the humanity out of war, but also changing our social landscape entirely, far from the battlefield.", "en": " 這兩座狙擊台都還是有人力介入 來下達致命攻擊的決策 但並不是技術上的需要，而是選項 這個選項就是我的重點 因為當我們將致命決策權 由人類轉移到軟體設備 我們冒的風險不僅是將人性抽離戰爭 同時也完全改變了我們的社會景觀 遠遠不是戰場可以形容的"}, {"zh-tw": " That's because the way humans resolve conflict shapes our social landscape. And this has always been the case, throughout history.", "en": " 因為人類解決衝突的方法 塑造了我們社會的樣貌 自古以來皆是如此"}, {"zh-tw": " For example, these were state-of-the-art weapons systems in 1400 A.D. Now they were both very expensive to build and maintain, but with these you could dominate the populace, and the distribution of political power in feudal society reflected that.", "en": " 好比說這些是西元1400年時 最先進的武器系統 儘管建造、保養代價高昂 但是透過這些武器我們可以統治群眾 封建社會下政治力量的分布顯示了這一點"}, {"zh-tw": " Power was focused at the very top. And what changed? Technological innovation.", "en": " 力量集中在最頂端 什麼改變了？科技革新"}, {"zh-tw": " Gunpowder, cannon. And pretty soon, armor and castles were obsolete, and it mattered less who you brought to the battlefield versus how many people you brought to the battlefield.", "en": " 火藥、大砲 不久之後，盔甲和城堡就被淘汰了 戰場上有什麼士兵不重要 數量有多少才是關鍵"}, {"zh-tw": " And as armies grew in size, the nation-state arose as a political and logistical requirement of defense. And as leaders had to rely on more of their populace, they began to share power.", "en": " 當軍隊壯大之後，出現了民族國家 來滿足政治及後勤方面在防禦上的需求 當領導人必須更加倚靠他們的人民 就會開始分權"}, {"zh-tw": " Representative government began to form. So again, the tools we use to resolve conflict shape our social landscape.", "en": " 代議政府開始成形 再一次，我們用來解決衝突的工具 塑造了我們社會的樣貌"}, {"zh-tw": " Autonomous robotic weapons are such a tool, except that, by requiring very few people to go to war, they risk re-centralizing power into very few hands, possibly reversing a five-century trend toward democracy. Now, I think, knowing this, we can take decisive steps to preserve our democratic institutions, to do what humans do best, which is adapt.", "en": " 自主機械武器就是這種工具 但是因為發動戰爭所需的人數不多 有極少數人再度集權統治的風險 可能讓五百年來民主化的趨勢走回頭路 我想，了解了之後 我們可以果斷的維持民主制度 來做我們人類最擅長的事，那就是適應環境"}, {"zh-tw": " But time is a factor. Seventy nations are developing remotely-piloted combat drones of their own, and as you'll see, remotely-piloted combat drones are the precursors to autonomous robotic weapons.", "en": " 但時間是一個因素 有七十個國家正在研發 他們自己的遠程無人戰鬥機 如你所見，遠程無人戰鬥機 正是自主機械武器的前身"}, {"zh-tw": " That's because once you've deployed remotely-piloted drones, there are three powerful factors pushing decision-making away from humans and on to the weapon platform itself. The first of these is the deluge of video that drones produce.", "en": " 因為一旦部屬了遠程無人戰鬥機 就會有三個強而有力的因素 迫使人們把決定權交給武器平台本身 第一個因素是無人戰機所拍攝的大量影像"}, {"zh-tw": " For example, in 2004, the U.S. drone fleet produced a grand total of 71 hours of video surveillance for analysis. By 2011, this had gone up to 300,000 hours, outstripping human ability to review it all, but even that number is about to go up drastically.", "en": " 像是在2004年，美國的無人機艦隊 拍攝了長達71小時的影像監控以供分析之用 到了2011年，影像長度增為30萬小時 超出人類檢視所有影像的能力 但即使數字之大，它依然大幅成長"}, {"zh-tw": " The Pentagon's Gorgon Stare and Argus programs will put up to 65 independently operated camera eyes on each drone platform, and this would vastly outstrip human ability to review it. And that means visual intelligence software will need to scan it for items of interest.", "en": " 五角大廈的「戈爾貢之眼(Gorgon Stare)」和「百眼巨人(Argus)」計畫 將會有65台獨立運作的攝影機 安裝在每架無人飛機上 而這將大幅超越人類所能檢視的能力 這意味著視覺智慧軟體必須掃描影像 找出我們感興趣的部分"}, {"zh-tw": " And that means very soon drones will tell humans what to look at, not the other way around. But there's a second powerful incentive pushing decision-making away from humans and onto machines, and that's electromagnetic jamming, severing the connection between the drone and its operator.", "en": " 這表示不久後無人飛機 將會告訴人類該看哪些部分 而非由人類來決定 還有第二個動機 迫使我們把決定權交給機器 那就是電磁干擾 它會切斷無人飛機 和操作員的連線"}, {"zh-tw": " Now we saw an example of this in 2011 when an American RQ-170 Sentinel drone got a bit confused over Iran due to a GPS spoofing attack, but any remotely-piloted drone is susceptible to this type of attack, and that means drones will have to shoulder more decision-making. They'll know their mission objective, and they'll react to new circumstances without human guidance.", "en": " 我們現在看到的例子是在2011年 美國的RQ-170哨兵式(Sentinel)無人飛機 在伊朗上空因為GPS受到欺騙攻擊而陷入混亂 這種攻擊對任何遠程無人飛機都有效 這表示無人飛機 必須去承擔更多決策 它們會知道它們的任務目標 沒有人類指導也能對新的狀況作出反應"}, {"zh-tw": " They'll ignore external radio signals and send very few of their own. Which brings us to, really, the third and most powerful incentive pushing decision-making away from humans and onto weapons: plausible deniability.", "en": " 它們會忽視外來的無線電訊號 只發出極少量的無線電訊號 這牽扯到第三個因素 也是最強烈的誘因 促使我們將決定權交給武器 那就是貌似合理的推託"}, {"zh-tw": " Now we live in a global economy. High-tech manufacturing is occurring on most continents.", "en": " 我們生活在一個全球經濟體下 大部分的地方都有高科技工業"}, {"zh-tw": " Cyber espionage is spiriting away advanced designs to parts unknown, and in that environment, it is very likely that a successful drone design will be knocked off in contract factories, proliferate in the gray market. And in that situation, sifting through the wreckage of a suicide drone attack, it will be very difficult to say who sent that weapon.", "en": " 網路間諜正在將先進的科技 帶到未知的地方 在這種環境下很有可能 成功的無人飛機設計，在灰市中量產 擊敗取得授權的工廠 如此一來，即使仔細調查 無人機自殺攻擊的殘骸 也難以斷定是誰發射這個武器"}, {"zh-tw": " This raises the very real possibility of anonymous war. This could tilt the geopolitical balance on its head, make it very difficult for a nation to turn its firepower against an attacker, and that could shift the balance in the 21st century away from defense and toward offense.", "en": " 這就很有可能 會引起匿名戰爭 可能會讓地緣政治傾向一頭 讓一個國家難以將它的炮火對準攻擊者 也會讓21世紀的維持的平衡 由防禦轉為侵略"}, {"zh-tw": " It could make military action a viable option not just for small nations, but criminal organizations, private enterprise, even powerful individuals. It could create a landscape of rival warlords undermining rule of law and civil society.", "en": " 使得軍事行動變成可行的選項 不只是小國 還有犯罪組織、私人企業 甚至是有權力的人都能這麼做 這樣可能會引發軍閥割據的混戰 破壞法律規範及文明社會"}, {"zh-tw": " Now if responsibility and transparency are two of the cornerstones of representative government, autonomous robotic weapons could undermine both. Now you might be thinking that citizens of high-tech nations would have the advantage in any robotic war, that citizens of those nations would be less vulnerable, particularly against developing nations.", "en": " 如果責任感以及透明度 是代議政治的兩塊基石 自主機械武器會破壞這兩者 你現在可能會覺得 高科技國家的人民 在機械戰爭中佔有優勢 這些國家的人民比較不容易受傷害 尤其是對抗發展中國家的時候"}, {"zh-tw": " But I think the truth is the exact opposite. I think citizens of high-tech societies are more vulnerable to robotic weapons, and the reason can be summed up in one word: data.", "en": " 但是我認為事實剛好相反 我認為高科技社會的人民 更容易受到機械武器傷害 其原因可以用兩個字來說明：資料"}, {"zh-tw": " Data powers high-tech societies. Cell phone geolocation, telecom metadata, social media, email, text, financial transaction data, transportation data, it's a wealth of real-time data on the movements and social interactions of people.", "en": " 資料壯大了高科技社會 手機定位、電訊後設資料 社交媒體、電子郵件、簡訊、金融交易資料 和運輸資料等，都是大量的即時資料 記載著人類的社交活動"}, {"zh-tw": " In short, we are more visible to machines than any people in history, and this perfectly suits the targeting needs of autonomous weapons. What you're looking at here is a link analysis map of a social group.", "en": " 簡單來說，比其任何其他時代 機器對人類來說更顯而易見 而這正好符合了自動武器的目標需求 大家現在看到的 是社會團體的連結分析圖"}, {"zh-tw": " Lines indicate social connectedness between individuals. And these types of maps can be automatically generated based on the data trail modern people leave behind.", "en": " 線段代表著人與人之間的社會連結 這類的圖只要依據現代人所留下的資料 就能夠自動產生"}, {"zh-tw": " Now it's typically used to market goods and services to targeted demographics, but it's a dual-use technology, because targeting is used in another context. Notice that certain individuals are highlighted.", "en": " 現在它應用於商品與服務的行銷 來統計目標群體，但這是雙面科技 因為目標的鎖定可應用於另外一種情況 我們注意到某些人是特別顯著的"}, {"zh-tw": " These are the hubs of social networks. These are organizers, opinion-makers, leaders, and these people also can be automatically identified from their communication patterns.", "en": " 他們是社會網絡的樞紐 他們是組織者、輿論製造者、領導者 而這些人依據他們的溝通模式 我們也能夠自動辨識"}, {"zh-tw": " Now, if you're a marketer, you might then target them with product samples, try to spread your brand through their social group. But if you're a repressive government searching for political enemies, you might instead remove them, eliminate them, disrupt their social group, and those who remain behind lose social cohesion and organization.", "en": " 如果現在你是一位營銷員，你可能將試用產品 鎖定這些人，試著把你的品牌 推廣到他們的社會團體中 但如果你是專制的政府 在搜尋政敵，你可能反而會除掉他們 消滅他們、破壞他們的社會團體 而剩下來的人就會失去他們的社會連結 以及社群組織"}, {"zh-tw": " Now in a world of cheap, proliferating robotic weapons, borders would offer very little protection to critics of distant governments or trans-national criminal organizations. Popular movements agitating for change could be detected early and their leaders eliminated before their ideas achieve critical mass.", "en": " 在一個機械武器便宜、氾濫的世界 國界的保護微不足道 無法防衛遠方政府的批評者 或是跨國犯罪組織 鼓吹改革的群眾運動 在大眾充分了解其訴求之前 就會被察覺，並將其領導人消滅"}, {"zh-tw": " And ideas achieving critical mass is what political activism in popular government is all about. Anonymous lethal weapons could make lethal action an easy choice for all sorts of competing interests.", "en": " 而充分的把想法傳達給大眾 正是一般政治激進主義政府所追求的 匿名的致命武器能夠讓致命行動 變成所有競爭者一個簡單的選項"}, {"zh-tw": " And this would put a chill on free speech and popular political action, the very heart of democracy. And this is why we need an international treaty on robotic weapons, and in particular a global ban on the development and deployment of killer robots.", "en": " 這會讓民主的核心－言論自由及民眾在政治上行動 轉為冷漠 這也就是為什麼我們需要國際公約 來規範機械武器，特別是 全球皆禁止研發及部屬殺手機器人"}, {"zh-tw": " Now we already have international treaties on nuclear and biological weapons, and, while imperfect, these have largely worked. But robotic weapons might be every bit as dangerous, because they will almost certainly be used, and they would also be corrosive to our democratic institutions.", "en": " 現在我們已經有國際公約 來規範核武及生物武器，雖然並不完美 但卻很有效 但是機械武器完全就是個危險的東西 因為它們幾乎一定會被使用 也會侵蝕我們的民主制度"}, {"zh-tw": " Now in November 2012 the U.S. Department of Defense issued a directive requiring a human being be present in all lethal decisions. This temporarily effectively banned autonomous weapons in the U.S. military, but that directive needs to be made permanent.", "en": " 2012年11月，美國國防部 直接要求 所有致命決策都必須有人類參與其中 這暫時有效防止美軍的自主武器 但是這個要求必須永久有效"}, {"zh-tw": " And it could set the stage for global action. Because we need an international legal framework for robotic weapons.", "en": " 它也可以為全球立法行動鋪路 因為我們需要國際性的法律架構 來規範機械武器"}, {"zh-tw": " And we need it now, before there's a devastating attack or a terrorist incident that causes nations of the world to rush to adopt these weapons before thinking through the consequences. Autonomous robotic weapons concentrate too much power in too few hands, and they would imperil democracy itself.", "en": " 我們現在就需要，以免毀滅性的恐怖攻擊事件 讓世界上的國家 爭相採用這些武器 完全不考慮後果 自動機械武器把太強大的力量 集中在太少人手中，而他們會威脅到民主本身"}, {"zh-tw": " Now, don't get me wrong, I think there are tons of great uses for unarmed civilian drones: environmental monitoring, search and rescue, logistics. If we have an international treaty on robotic weapons, how do we gain the benefits of autonomous drones and vehicles while still protecting ourselves against illegal robotic weapons? I think the secret will be transparency.", "en": " 別誤解了我的意思，我認為 這些非武裝的民用無人飛機好用途不少 環境監控、搜救、後勤 如果我們有機械武器的國際公約 我們要如何從自主無人飛機及載具中獲得好處 同時又能夠保護我們自己 免於違法機械武器的侵害呢 我認為機密會變得透明化"}, {"zh-tw": " No robot should have an expectation of privacy in a public place. Each robot and drone should have a cryptographically signed I.D. burned in at the factory that can be used to track its movement through public spaces.", "en": " 任何的機器人在公共場所 都不得有隱私 每一台機器人或無人飛機 在工廠裡都要烙上一個加密的身分 可以用來追蹤它在公共場所的動向"}, {"zh-tw": " We have license plates on cars, tail numbers on aircraft. This is no different.", "en": " 我們的車子有車牌，飛機有機尾編號 這是同樣的道理"}, {"zh-tw": " And every citizen should be able to download an app that shows the population of drones and autonomous vehicles moving through public spaces around them, both right now and historically. And civic leaders should deploy sensors and civic drones to detect rogue drones, and instead of sending killer drones of their own up to shoot them down, they should notify humans to their presence.", "en": " 每個市民都可以下載應用程式 來顯示無人飛機及自動載具 在他們附近的公共空間移動的數量 不論是過去或是現在 領導者應該要部屬感應器還有民用無人飛機 來偵測圖謀不軌的無人飛機 而且不是直接派自己的無人攻擊機將它們擊落 而是應該告知人們這些無人飛機的存在"}, {"zh-tw": " And in certain very high-security areas, perhaps civic drones would snare them and drag them off to a bomb disposal facility. But notice, this is more an immune system than a weapons system.", "en": " 在確定是高安全性的地區 或許民用無人飛機 可以將它們引導到炸彈處理設施 但要注意的是，這比較像是免疫系統 而不是武器系統"}, {"zh-tw": " It would allow us to avail ourselves of the use of autonomous vehicles and drones while still preserving our open, civil society. We must ban the deployment and development of killer robots.", "en": " 如此就可以讓我們 獲得自主載具與無人飛機所帶來的好處 同時保有我們開放、文明的社會 我們必須禁止研發及部屬 殺手機器人"}, {"zh-tw": " Let's not succumb to the temptation to automate war.
