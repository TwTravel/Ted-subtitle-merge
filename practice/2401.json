This was the mostexciting day of Vera's life.", "en": " 黑暗的空間里，只有緊急出口的綠色標誌亮著。 這是薇拉生命中最激動的時刻。"}, {"zh-tw": " She was the youngestconcert promoter in Germany, and she had persuadedthe Cologne Opera House to host a late-night concert of jazz from the American musician, Keith Jarrett. 1,400 people were coming.", "en": " 她是德國最年輕的演奏會經紀人， 她說服了科隆歌劇院 舉辦美國音樂家，凱斯·傑瑞特的 晚間爵士樂演奏會。 1400位聽眾即將到場。"}, {"zh-tw": " And in just a few hours, Jarrett would walk out on the same stage, he'd sit down at the piano and without rehearsal or sheet music, he would begin to play. But right now, Vera was introducing Keithto the piano in question, and it wasn't going well.", "en": " 幾個小時後， 傑瑞特就會走向這個舞台， 他坐在鋼琴邊 無需綵排或是散頁樂譜， 他會開始演奏。 但現在， 薇拉向凱斯展示的鋼琴出了些問題， 事情進展不順利。"}, {"zh-tw": " Jarrett looked to the instrumenta little warily, played a few notes, walked around it, played a few more notes, muttered something to his producer. Then the producercame over to Vera and said ...", "en": " 傑瑞特謹慎地看著樂器， 彈奏了幾個小片段， 繞著它轉了轉， 又彈奏了幾個小片段， 跟他的製作人嘟囔了些什麼。 製作人走到薇拉跟前說到 ..."}, {"zh-tw": " \"If you don't get a new piano,Keith can't play.\" There'd been a mistake. The opera house had providedthe wrong instrument.", "en": " “如果沒有辦法送來一台新鋼琴，凱斯會取消演奏。” 一定發生了錯誤。 歌劇院提供了錯誤的樂器。"}, {"zh-tw": " This one had this harsh,tinny upper register, because all the felt had worn away. The black notes were sticking, the white notes were out of tune, the pedals didn't work and the piano itself was just too small.", "en": " 這台鋼琴的高音部劣質而且刺耳， 因為鋼琴內部的毛氈磨損嚴重。 黑鍵粘粘的， 白鍵走調了。 踏板無法使用 鋼琴的個頭也太小了。"}, {"zh-tw": " It wouldn't create the volume that would fill a large spacesuch as the Cologne Opera House. So Keith Jarrett left.", "en": " 它無法發出 能夠填滿科隆歌劇院這樣寬敞空間的聲音。 於是凱斯·傑瑞特離開了。"}, {"zh-tw": " He went and sat outside in his car, leaving Vera Brandes to get on the phoneto try to find a replacement piano. Now she got a piano tuner, but she couldn't get a new piano.", "en": " 他站在他的車邊， 留下薇拉·布蘭德斯 撥打電話試圖尋找一台能夠替代的鋼琴。 她找到了一個鋼琴調律師， 但她無法拿到新的鋼琴。"}, {"zh-tw": " And so she went outside and she stood there in the rain, talking to Keith Jarrett, begging him not to cancel the concert. And he looked out of his car at this bedraggled,rain-drenched German teenager, took pity on her, and said, \"Never forget ... only for you.\" And so a few hours later, Jarrett did indeed step outonto the stage of the opera house, he sat down at the unplayable piano and began.", "en": " 她走到外面 站在雨中， 和凱斯·傑瑞特說話， 拜託他不要取消演奏會。 他看著車外 這個被雨淋著渾身濕透的德國年輕人， 有些同情， 隨後說道， “永遠別忘了...只是為了你。” 幾小時后， 傑瑞特走上了歌劇院的舞台， 他坐在這台無法達到演奏標準的鋼琴面前 開始了。"}, {"zh-tw": " (Music) Within moments it became clearthat something magical was happening. Jarrett was avoidingthose upper registers, he was sticking to the middletones of the keyboard, which gave the piecea soothing, ambient quality.", "en": " （音樂） 很快就發現奇蹟正在發生。 傑瑞特避免了高音區， 他專注在鍵盤的中間區域， 這給了曲子一個舒緩，音效環繞的品質。"}, {"zh-tw": " But also, because the piano was so quiet, he had to set up these rumbling,repetitive riffs in the bass. And he stood up twisting,pounding down on the keys, desperately trying to create enough volumeto reach the people in the back row.", "en": " 但同時，因為鋼琴如此平靜， 他必須在低音區製造重複出現的隆隆聲。 他站起身旋轉，重擊琴鍵， 拼命地想製造足夠的音量讓後排的觀眾也能聽到。"}, {"zh-tw": " It's an electrifying performance. It somehow has this peaceful quality, and at the same time it's full of energy, it's dynamic.", "en": " 這是個令人興奮地演出。 卻有著這樣平靜的質感， 同時又飽含能量， 富有活力，"}, {"zh-tw": " And the audience loved it. Audiences continue to love it because the recording of the Köln Concert is the best-selling piano album in history and the best-sellingsolo jazz album in history.", "en": " 聽眾太愛這場演出了。 聽眾持續保有熱情 因為科隆演奏會的錄音 是歷史上最暢銷的鋼琴專輯 也是歷史上最暢銷的個人爵士專輯。"}, {"zh-tw": " Keith Jarrett had been handed a mess. He had embraced that mess, and it soared.", "en": " 凱斯·傑瑞特遇到了一個麻煩。 他包容了這個麻煩，讓麻煩變成了崛起的創意。"}, {"zh-tw": " But let's think for a momentabout Jarrett's initial instinct. He didn't want to play.", "en": " 但是，讓我們想一想傑瑞特最初的反應。 他不想演出了。"}, {"zh-tw": " Of course, I think any of us,in any remotely similar situation, would feel the same way,we'd have the same instinct. We don't want to be askedto do good work with bad tools.", "en": " 當然， 我想我們中的每個人，在任何相似的情況下， 會有同樣的感受，我們會有同樣的反應。 我們不想被要求用糟糕的工具做好工作。"}, {"zh-tw": " We don't want to have to overcomeunnecessary hurdles. But Jarrett's instinct was wrong, and thank goodness he changed his mind.", "en": " 我們不想克服不必要的麻煩。 但是傑瑞特的直覺錯了， 感謝上帝他改變了主意。"}, {"zh-tw": " And I think our instinct is also wrong. I think we need to gaina bit more appreciation for the unexpected advantagesof having to cope with a little mess.", "en": " 我想我們的直覺也是錯的。 我想我們需要更多的感激 那些需要面對小麻煩的出人意料的優勢。"}, {"zh-tw": " So let me give you some examples from cognitive psychology, from complexity science, from social psychology, and of course, rock 'n' roll. So cognitive psychology first.", "en": " 讓我給你們提供一些例子 來自認知心理學 來自複雜性科學， 來自社會心理學， 以及當然，搖滾樂。 首先，認知心理學。"}, {"zh-tw": " We've actually known for a while that certain kinds of difficulty, certain kinds of obstacle, can actually improve our performance. For example, the psychologist Daniel Oppenheimer, a few years ago, teamed up with high school teachers.", "en": " 長久以來我們知道 某些困難， 某些障礙， 能夠促使我們提高表現力。 比如， 心理學家丹尼爾·奧本海默， 數年前， 與高中老師合作。"}, {"zh-tw": " And he asked them to reformat the handouts that they were givingto some of their classes. So the regular handout would be formattedin something straightforward, such as Helvetica or Times New Roman.", "en": " 他請他們革新 正在上課的一些講義。 普通的教案已一種很直接的方式， 像是赫維提卡字體或是新羅馬體。"}, {"zh-tw": " But half these classes were gettinghandouts that were formatted in something sort of intense,like Haettenschweiler, or something with a zesty bounce,like Comic Sans italicized. Now, these are really ugly fonts, and they're difficult fonts to read.", "en": " 但是超半數的學生會拿到標準的講義 用一種加深顏色的嚴肅字體，像是Haettenschweiler， 或者是增添興趣的字體，像是斜體的Comic Sans。 現在，這些事很醜的字體， 也很難閱讀。"}, {"zh-tw": " But at the end of the semester, students were given exams, and the students who'd been askedto read the more difficult fonts, had actually done better on their exams, in a variety of subjects. And the reason is, the difficult font had slowed them down, forced them to work a bit harder, to think a bit moreabout what they were reading, to interpret it ...", "en": " 但在學期末， 學生們進行了測試， 那些被要求閱讀更加難懂的字體的學生， 事實上在考試中表現更好， 很多學科都是這樣。 原因是， 難懂的字體拖慢了他們的速度， 逼迫他們更加努力學習， 更審慎思考他們所讀的內容， 來解讀它 ..."}, {"zh-tw": " and so they learned more. Another example.", "en": " 因此他們學到了更多。 另一個例子。"}, {"zh-tw": " The psychologist Shelley Carsonhas been testing Harvard undergraduates for the qualityof their attentional filters. What do I mean by that? What I mean is,imagine you're in a restaurant, you're having a conversation, there are all kinds of other conversationsgoing on in the restaurant, you want to filter them out, you want to focuson what's important to you.", "en": " 心理學家謝麗·卡森給哈佛大學的大學生做測試 來研究他們的專注力的過濾能力。 那是什麼意思呢？ 我是說，想像你在一間餐廳裡， 你正在進行一場對話， 餐廳裡還有很多別的正在進行中的對話， 你會過濾它們， 你想要專注於對你來說重要的對話。"}, {"zh-tw": " Can you do that? If you can, you havegood, strong attentional filters. But some people really struggle with that.", "en": " 你能做到嗎？ 如果你能，那說明你有很好地很強的注意力過濾能力。 但是很多人真的在為這樣的能力奮鬥著。"}, {"zh-tw": " Some of Carson's undergraduatesubjects struggled with that. They had weak filters,they had porous filters -- let a lot of external information in.", "en": " 卡森測試的一部分大學生就為這樣的能力掙扎。 他們有較弱的過濾能力，他們的過濾機制有漏洞﹣﹣ 讓很多外部的資訊進入。"}, {"zh-tw": " And so what that meant is they wereconstantly being interrupted by the sights and the soundsof the world around them. If there was a television onwhile they were doing their essays, they couldn't screen it out.", "en": " 那就意味著，他們時常被干擾 被周圍的畫面和聲音干擾。 如果他們在寫作的時候旁邊有一台正在播放的電視機， 他們無法把電視機的干擾過濾出去。"}, {"zh-tw": " Now, you would thinkthat that was a disadvantage ... but no.", "en": " 現在，你會想這是個劣勢 ... 但不是這樣的。"}, {"zh-tw": " When Carson looked at whatthese students had achieved, the ones with the weak filters were vastly more likely to have some realcreative milestone in their lives, to have published their first novel, to have released their first album. These distractions were actuallygrists to their creative mill.", "en": " 當卡森查看這些學生的表現時， 那些過濾能力弱的 極大程度上更可能 在他們的人生中創作出真正的里程碑， 出版他們的第一本小說， 發第一張唱片， 這些外部的干擾真正引發了他們的創意工廠。"}, {"zh-tw": " They were able to think outside the boxbecause their box was full of holes. Let's talk about complexity science.", "en": " 他們因此能夠跳出盒子思考問題因為他們的盒子上全是小洞。 讓我們來說說複雜性科學。"}, {"zh-tw": " So how do you solve a really complex -- the world's fullof complicated problems -- how do you solvea really complicated problem? For example, you try to make a jet engine. There are lots and lotsof different variables, the operating temperature, the materials, all the different dimensions, the shape.", "en": " 你是如何解決一個真正複雜問題的-- 這個世界充滿了複雜的問題 -- 你要如何解決一個真正複雜的問題？ 比如，你要試圖製造飛機引擎， 面對很多很多不同的變量、 運作溫度、材料、 所有不同的維度、形狀。"}, {"zh-tw": " You can't solve that kindof problem all in one go, it's too hard. So what do you do? Well, one thing you can dois try to solve it step-by-step.", "en": " 你無法一次性解決所有的問題， 這太艱難了。 你要怎麼做呢？ 你能做的是試圖一步步解決它。"}, {"zh-tw": " So you have some kind of prototype and you tweak it,you test it, you improve it. You tweak it, you test it, you improve it.", "en": " 你有了初樣 然後你改進它，實驗，然後提高它的質量。 再改進，實驗，提高質量。"}, {"zh-tw": " Now, this idea of marginal gainswill eventually get you a good jet engine. And it's been quite widelyimplemented in the world.", "en": " 這樣的邊際增益的概念最終能讓你完成一個性能優良的飛機引擎， 這樣的做事方式在世界上很常見。"}, {"zh-tw": " So you'll hear about it, for example,in high performance cycling, web designers will talk about tryingto optimize their web pages, they're lookingfor these step-by-step gains. That's a good wayto solve a complicated problem.", "en": " 你會在比如說，高強度自行車運動練習中見到這樣的過程， 網頁設計師會討論試圖優化他們的網站， 他們都在尋找著這樣一步步的收穫。 這是一個解決複雜問題的好方法。"}, {"zh-tw": " But you know what wouldmake it a better way? A dash of mess. You add randomness, early on in the process, you make crazy moves, you try stupid things that shouldn't work, and that will tend to makethe problem-solving work better.", "en": " 但你知道有什麼能夠讓它更好嗎？ 一些雜亂。 你在過程開始的時候， 加入不確定性， 你做出瘋狂的舉動， 你做本不可能成功地蠢事， 這都會使問題解決方法效果更好，"}, {"zh-tw": " And the reason for that is the trouble with the step-by-step process, the marginal gains, is they can walk yougradually down a dead end. And if you start with the randomness,that becomes less likely, and your problem-solvingbecomes more robust.", "en": " 原因是 一步一步的過程的問題在於， 邊際增益， 是它們引導你走到死胡同。 如果你開始就很隨意，那就不大會這樣， 你的問題解決過程會更加高效。"}, {"zh-tw": " Let's talk about social psychology. So the psychologist Katherine Phillips,with some colleagues, recently gave murder mysteryproblems to some students, and these studentswere collected in groups of four and they were given dossierswith information about a crime -- alibis and evidence,witness statements and three suspects.", "en": " 讓我們從社會心理學角度分析。 心理學家凱瑟琳．飛利浦和她的同事們， 近期向學生們提出了怪誕的的謀殺問題， 這些學生編成四人一組 學生們拿到關於謀殺的檔案﹣﹣ 不在場證明和證據、證人的證詞和三個疑犯。"}, {"zh-tw": " And the groups of four studentswere asked to figure out who did it, who committed the crime. And there were two treatmentsin this experiment.", "en": " 他們需要找出真兇是誰， 誰為這場謀殺負責。 這項實驗有兩個項目。"}, {"zh-tw": " In some cases these were four friends, they all knew each other well. In other cases, three friends and a stranger.", "en": " 在一些案例中，有四個友人， 他們都非常了解對方。 在另一些案例中， 是三個友人和一個陌生人。"}, {"zh-tw": " And you can see where I'm going with this. Obviously I'm going to say that the groups with the strangersolved the problem more effectively, which is true, they did.", "en": " 一會兒你就會了解到我這麼做的意義。 很明顯，我要說的是 那些由三個友人一個陌生人組成的小組更高效地解決了問題， 這是真的，他們確實做到了。"}, {"zh-tw": " Actually, they solved the problemquite a lot more effectively. So the groups of four friends, they only had a 50-50 chanceof getting the answer right.", "en": " 事實上，他們解決問題的效率非常高。 那些由四個友人組成的小組， 他們只有50﹣50的幾率來得出正確答案。"}, {"zh-tw": " Which is actually not that great -- in multiple choice, for three answers?50-50's not good. The three friends and the stranger, even though the strangerdidn't have any extra information, even though it was just a case of how that changed the conversationto accommodate that awkwardness, the three friends and the stranger, they had a 75 percent chanceof finding the right answer.", "en": " 這聽起來確實不那麼好﹣﹣ 在多項選擇中，有三個答案？50﹣50的幾率不那麼好。 三個友人和一個陌生人， 即使陌生人沒有獲得額外的資訊， 即使是在 如何對話以防止尷尬， 三個友人和一個陌生人的組合， 有 75％ 的機會能夠找到正確的答案。"}, {"zh-tw": " That's quite a big leap in performance. But I think what's really interesting is not just that the three friendsand the stranger did a better job, but how they felt about it.", "en": " 那是一個很大的飛越。 但我覺得真正有趣的 不是三個友人和一個陌生人的組合完成得更好， 而是他們對這次活動的感受。"}, {"zh-tw": " So when Katherine Phillipsinterviewed the groups of four friends, they had a nice time, they also thought they'd done a good job. They were complacent.", "en": " 當凱瑟琳．飛利浦詢問四個友人組合的感受時， 他們相處很愉悅， 他們也認為自己做得很好。 他們很滿足。"}, {"zh-tw": " When she spoke to the threefriends and the stranger, they had not had a nice time -- it's actually rather difficult,it's rather awkward ... and they were full of doubt.", "en": " 當她詢問三個友人一個陌生人組合時 他們並沒有很愉快﹣﹣ 有點兒困難，有些尷尬 ... 他們充滿了疑慮。"}, {"zh-tw": " They didn't think they'd done a good jobeven though they had. And I think that really exemplifies the challenge that we'redealing with here.", "en": " 他們不認為自己完成得很好即使他們確實完成得很好。 我想這個例子很適合 拿來討論今天我們面對的難題。"}, {"zh-tw": " Because, yeah -- the ugly font, the awkward stranger, the random move ... these disruptions help us solve problems, they help us become more creative.", "en": " 因為，是的﹣﹣ 難看的字體， 尷尬的陌生人， 那些不確定性 ... 這些打擾我們的事情幫助我們解決問題， 它們讓我們更加有創意。"}, {"zh-tw": " But we don't feel that they're helping us. We feel that they'regetting in the way ...", "en": " 但我們感受不到它們的幫助。 我們認為它們是路上的障礙 ..."}, {"zh-tw": " and so we resist. And that's why the last exampleis really important.", "en": " 所以我們反抗。 這就是為什麼最後一個例子非常重要。"}, {"zh-tw": " So I want to talk about somebody from the backgroundof the world of rock 'n' roll. And you may know him,he's actually a TED-ster.", "en": " 我想要談到某個人 他的背景是搖滾樂。 你也許知道他是誰，他是一個 TED 迷。"}, {"zh-tw": " His name is Brian Eno. He is an ambient composer --rather brilliant.", "en": " 他的名字是布萊恩．伊諾。 他是一個著名音樂製作人﹣﹣非常傑出。"}, {"zh-tw": " He's also a kind of catalyst behind some of the greatrock 'n' roll albums of the last 40 years.

Well, he makes a mess. He disrupts their creative processes.", "en": " 他做了什麼讓這些搖滾樂團更加好呢？ 嗯，他製造麻煩。 他干擾他們的創意過程。"}, {"zh-tw": " It's his role to be the awkward stranger. It's his role to tell them that they have to playthe unplayable piano.", "en": " 他的角色就是一個尷尬的陌生人。 他存在就是為了告訴他們 他們必須要彈奏無法演奏的鋼琴。"}, {"zh-tw": " And one of the waysin which he creates this disruption is through this remarkabledeck of cards -- I have my signed copy here --thank you, Brian. They're called The Oblique Strategies, he developed them with a friend of his.", "en": " 他製造這些干擾的一個方式就是 通過這一疊紙牌﹣﹣ 我手中的這疊是簽名版﹣﹣謝謝你，布萊恩。 這是傾斜戰術， 他和一個朋友一起發明了這個。"}, {"zh-tw": " And when they're stuck in the studio, Brian Eno will reach for one of the cards. He'll draw one at random, and he'll make the bandfollow the instructions on the card.", "en": " 當他們在工作室文思枯竭的時候， 布萊恩．伊諾拿出牌中的一張。 他會任意選一張， 然後讓樂隊根據卡片上的引導。"}, {"zh-tw": " So this one ... \"Change instrument roles.\" Yeah, everyone swap instruments --Drummer on the piano -- Brilliant, brilliant idea.", "en": " 這一個 ... 「改變彈奏的樂器。」 是的，每個人都交換樂器﹣﹣鼓手來彈鋼琴﹣﹣ 太棒了，太棒的主意了。"}, {"zh-tw": " \"Look closely at the most embarrassing details. Amplify them.\" \"Make a sudden, destructive,unpredictable action. Incorporate.\" These cards are disruptive. Now, they've proved their worthin album after album.", "en": " 「仔細研究最尷尬的細節。然後放大它們。」 「做出突然地，具有毀滅性的，無法預測的反應。合併它們。」 這些卡片製造混亂。 現在，它們通過一張張唱片證實了自己的價值所在。"}, {"zh-tw": " The musicians hate them.
