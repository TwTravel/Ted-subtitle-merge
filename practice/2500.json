And I'm also going to show you how it can make any science teachermore than twice as effective.", "en": " 今天，我要向各位展示 我手上這台平板電腦及頭上這台虛擬實境頭戴裝置 將如何變革我們的科學教育。 而我稍後也會向各位展示 如何讓科學老師的教學效果提高兩倍。"}, {"zh-tw": " But before I show youhow all of this is possible, let's talk briefly about why improvingthe quality of science education is so vitally important. If you think about it, the world is growing incredibly fast.", "en": " 但在我向各位展示這些如何可以實現之前， 讓我們先簡短聊聊，為什麼改善科學的教學質量 這麼的重要。 各位想一下， 世界的成長變化如此的快速。"}, {"zh-tw": " And with that growth comesa whole list of growing challenges, challenges such as dealingwith global warming, solving starvation and water shortages and curing diseases, to name just a few. And who, exactly, is going to help ussolve all of these great challenges? Well, to a very last degree,it is these young students.", "en": " 而伴隨著成長，相對地也帶來了一系列的挑戰， 像是解決全球暖化問題、 解決飢餓、水源不足、 治療疾病， 等等問題... 而又有誰，可以幫助我們解決這些問題呢？ 嗯，說到底，是這些青年學生。"}, {"zh-tw": " This is the next generationof young, bright scientists. And in many ways, we all rely on them for coming up with new, great innovations to help us solve allthese challenges ahead of us.", "en": " 他們是下一代年輕的、聰明的科學家。 在很多方面，我們都需要仰賴他們 從創造出偉大的發明， 到來幫助我們解決眼前所面臨的種種挑戰。"}, {"zh-tw": " And so a couple of years back, my cofounder and I were teachinguniversity students just like these, only the students we were teachinglooked a little bit more like this here. And yes, this is reallythe reality out there in way too many universitiesaround the world: students that are bored, disengaged and sometimes not even surewhy they're learning about a topic in the first place.", "en": " 幾年前， 我和我的共同出資人在大學教類似這樣的學生， 但我們教的學生，他們的上課狀況比較類似這樣... 沒錯，這就是外面的真實世界， 全世界很多大學都有類似的情況： 學生覺得老師上課無聊，自己也無精打采， 有時候，他們甚至都無法了解最初為什麼要學這個話題。"}, {"zh-tw": " So we started looking around for new,innovative teaching methods, but what we found was quite disappointing. We saw that books were beingturned into e-books, blackboards were being turnedinto YouTube videos and lecture hall monologueswere being turned into MOOCs -- massive online open courses.", "en": " 所以，我們開始尋找新的創新教學方法， 但我們找到的東西都相當令人失望。 我們看到實體書變成了電子書， 黑板變成了 YouTube 影片， 而演講大廳裡的長篇演說變成了 MOOCs --大量線上開放課程。"}, {"zh-tw": " And if you think about it, all we're really doing hereis taking the same content and the same format, and bringing it out to more students -- which is great, don't get mewrong, that is really great -- but the teaching methodis still more or less the same, no real innovation there. So we started looking elsewhere.", "en": " 如果你仔細想想， 我們現在在做的事， 只是把同樣的內容格式 帶出去給更多的學生-- 這很棒，各位不要誤會，這真的很棒-- 但教學方法多多少少都還是一樣， 沒有真正的創新。 所以，我們開始在其它領域尋找。"}, {"zh-tw": " What we found was that flight simulatorshad been proven over and over again to be far more effective when used in combination with real,in-flight training to train the pilots. And so we thought to ourselves: Why not just apply that to science? Why not build a virtuallaboratory simulator? Well, we did it.", "en": " 我們發現，飛機模擬控制台， 當與用來訓練飛行員的真實飛行訓練一起使用時， 已經一次又一次地被證實相當有效。 所以，我們自己在想： 為什麼不把這個運用到科學教學上呢？ 為什麼不建立一個虛擬實驗室的模擬控制台呢？ 沒錯，我們辦到了。"}, {"zh-tw": " We basically set out to create a fully simulated, one-to-one,virtual reality laboratory simulator, where the studentscould perform experiments with mathematical equations that would simulate what wouldhappen in a real-world lab. But not just simple simulations -- we would also create advanced simulations with top universities like MIT, to bring out cutting-edge cancerresearch to these students.", "en": " 我們基本上創造出了 一個全擬真，一對一的，虛擬實境實驗室的模擬控制台， 在這裡，學生可以 用數學公式進行 將會模擬出真實實驗室情況的實驗。 但並不是只有簡單的模擬—— 我們也與麻省理工學院這樣的知名大學 合作建立了先進的模擬課程， 帶給這些學生們最新的癌症研究體驗。"}, {"zh-tw": " And suddenly, the universitiescould save millions of dollars by letting the studentsperform virtual experiments before they go into the real laboratory. And not only that; now,they could also understand -- even on a molecular levelinside the machine -- what is happening to the machines.", "en": " 突然間，校方也節省了很多經費， 通過讓學生進行虛擬實驗 在他們進入真正的實驗室之前。 不僅如此，現在，他們也可以理解 － 甚至在儀器中的分子層面 － 了解到儀器裡面發生了甚麼變化。"}, {"zh-tw": " And then they could suddenly perform dangerous experiments in the labs as well. For instance also here, learning about salmonella bacteria,which is an important topic that many schools cannot teachfor good safety reasons.", "en": " 而且他們也可以即時地 在虛擬實驗室裡從事危險的實驗。 舉個例子， 比如學習沙門氏菌一個相當重要但是 很多學校出於安全原因，而無法提供的課題。"}, {"zh-tw": " And we, of course, quiz the students and then give the teachersa full dashboard, so they fully understandwhere the students are at. But we didn't stop there, because we had seen justhow important meaning is for the students' engagement in the class.", "en": " 當然，我們也會給學生做測試， 然後給老師課程進度表 以便他們全面性地了解學生們的學習狀況。 但是，我們並沒有停滯不前， 因為我們已經看到 鼓勵學生參與到課程中具有相當重要的意義。"}, {"zh-tw": " So we brought in game designers to create fun and engaging stories. For instance, here in this case, where the students have to solvea mysterious CSI murder case using their core science skills.", "en": " 所以我們請遊戲設計者 幫我們創造好玩又引人入勝的遊戲。 比如，在這個案例中， 學生要用他們的核心科學技術，來破解神秘的 CSI 暗殺事件。"}, {"zh-tw": " And the feedback we gotwhen we launched all of this was quite overwhelmingly positive. Here we have 300 students, all passionately solving CSI murder cases while learning core science skills.", "en": " 當我們發表全部的設計後， 得到的反饋都是相當正面的。 這裡我們有 300 個學生， 當他們在學核心科學技術時， 都相當投入地想解開CSI 的暗殺之謎。"}, {"zh-tw": " And what I love the most about this is really when the studentscome up to me sometimes afterwards, all surprised and a little confused, and say, \"I just spent two hoursin this virtual lab, and ... and I didn't check Facebook.\" That's how engaging and immersivethis really is for the students. And so, to investigatewhether this really worked, a learning psychologistdid a study with 160 students -- that was from Stanford Universityand Technical University of Denmark.", "en": " 而我讓我最享受的是， 有時候真的有學生課後會來找我， 然後用相當驚訝且有點困惑的表情說， 「我剛剛竟然在虛擬實驗室度過了兩個小時， 而且....我竟然沒有瀏覽 Facebook。」 這就是虛擬實驗室對學生來說都有吸引力、多仿真。 為了調查這樣做是否真的可行， 一位學習心理學家對160名學生做了研究 － 他們來自史丹福大學及丹麥技術大學。"}, {"zh-tw": " And what they did is splitthe students into two groups. One group would only usethe virtual laboratory simulations, the other group would only usetraditional teaching methods, and they had the same amount of time.", "en": " 他們把學生分成兩組。 第一組學生只能進行虛擬實驗室模擬教學方式。 另一組學生只能進行傳統的教學方式。 他們上課的時間都一樣。"}, {"zh-tw": " Then, interestingly, they gave the students a testbefore and after the experiment, so they could clearly measurethe learning impact of the students. And what they found was a surprisingly high 76 percentincrease in the learning effectiveness when using virtual laboratoriesover traditional teaching methods.", "en": " 接下來有趣的是， 他們在實驗前與實驗後分別對學生進行測驗， 這樣他們就可以測量出學生的學習效果。 他們發現， 虛擬實驗室教學方式比傳統教學方式提高了76%的教學效果。"}, {"zh-tw": " But even more interestingly, the second part of this study investigated what the teacher's impactwas on the learning. And what they found was that when you combinedthe virtual laboratories with teacher-led coaching and mentoring, then we saw a total 101 percentincrease in the learning effectiveness, which effectively doublesthe science teacher's impact with the same amount of time spent.", "en": " 但更有趣的是在研究調查的第二部分， 有關老師在旁輔導的影響力。 他們發現， 如果你把虛擬實驗室與 老師在旁協助結合在一起， 學生的學習效果會提高 101% ， 這實際上是傳統教師教學效果的兩倍。"}, {"zh-tw": " So a couple of months back, we started asking ourselves -- we have a wonderful team nowof learning psychologists and teachers and scientistsand game developers -- and we started asking ourselves: How can we keep ourselves to our promise of constantly reimagining education? And today, I am really excitedto be presenting what we came up with and have been workingincredibly hard to create. I will explain briefly what this is.", "en": " 幾個月後， 我們開始問我們自己-- 我們現在有很棒的團隊我們有學習心理學專家、 老師、科學家、遊戲開發商-- 我們開始問我們自己： 我們要如何保持我們對自己 不斷創新教學的承諾？ 今天，我真的很興奮可以展示我們的成果， 我們相當努力且不斷創新。 我簡單的說明一下這是甚麼。"}, {"zh-tw": " Basically, I take my mobile phone -- most students alreadyhave these, smartphones -- and I plug it into this virtual-realityheadset, a low-cost headset. And now what I can effectively do is, I can literally stepinto this virtual world.", "en": " 基本上，我只要拿出我的手機-- 大多數的學生都有這個，智能手機-- 然後，我把它插進這頭戴裝置中，這個相當便宜的裝置。 現在我可以有效率做的就是， 我可以真的進入到這個虛擬的世界。"}, {"zh-tw": " We'll have some of youin the audience also get to try this, because it is really somethingthat you have to try to fully feel how immersive it really is. It literally feels like I just steppedinside this virtual lab.", "en": " 觀眾當中有幾位已經拿到裝置準備嘗試了， 因為你真的可以嘗試看看， 體驗一下它有多麼的真實。 我簡直就是已經進入到這個虛擬實驗室。"}, {"zh-tw": " Do you see me up on the screen? Audience: Yes. Michael Bodekaer: Great! Awesome.", "en": " 你們有看到我嗎，有沒有在螢幕上？ 觀眾：有。 麥可：很好！太棒了！"}, {"zh-tw": " So basically, I have justturned my mobile phone into a fully simulated, million-dollarIvy League laboratory with all this amazing equipmentthat I can interact with. I can, for instance, pick up the pipetteand do experiments with it.", "en": " 基本上，我已經把我的手機 轉進到這個全擬真、價值百萬的常春藤聯盟實驗室裡了， 這裡面有相當棒的儀器可以跟我互動。 舉個例子，我可以拿起吸量管做實驗。"}, {"zh-tw": " I have my E-Ggel, my PCRand -- oh, look there, I have my next-generationsequencing machine, and there I even havemy electron microscope. I mean, who's carrying aroundan electron microscope in their pocket? And here I have my machine, I can do different experimentson the machine.", "en": " 我有 E-Ggel，PCR儀器，喔，你看那邊， 我有次世代的定序儀器， 我甚至有我的電子顯微鏡。 我的意思是，有誰能把電子顯微鏡放在口袋？ 這裡，我有自己的儀器， 我可以在儀器上做不同的實驗。"}, {"zh-tw": " And over here I have the door, I can go into other experiments, I can perform in the laboratories. And here, I have my learning tablet.", "en": " 這裡，還有一扇門， 我可以進去做其它實驗， 我可以在實驗室裡進行實驗。 還有這個，我有自己的學習平板。"}, {"zh-tw": " This is an intelligent tablet that allows me to readabout relevant theory. As you can see, I can interact with it.", "en": " 這是一個智能平板， 可以讓我閱讀相關的理論。 就如你所見的，我可以與它互動。"}, {"zh-tw": " I can watch videos and seecontent that is relevant to the experimentthat I'm performing right now. Then over here, I have Marie.", "en": " 我可以看影片， 也可以看我接下來準備要做的實驗的相關內容。 然後這邊，這位是瑪莉。"}, {"zh-tw": " She is my teacher --my lab assistant -- and what she does is guides methrough this whole laboratory. And very soon, the teachers will be ableto literally teleport themselves into this virtual worldthat I'm in right now and help me, guide me,through this whole experiment.", "en": " 她是我的老師，我的實驗室助理， 她做的就是，介紹給我實驗室的一切。 很快的， 老師們將可以把他們自己瞬間移動到 我現在所處的虛擬世界裡來， 並幫助我、導引我做完整個實驗。"}, {"zh-tw": " And now before I finalize this, I want to show youan even cooler thing, I think -- something you cannoteven do in real laboratories. This is a PCR machine.", "en": " 在我要結束前， 我想要向各位展示更酷的東西， 我認為你在真實的實驗室裡甚至都沒辦法接觸到。 就是這一台 PCR 儀器。（聚合脢連鎖反應儀器）"}, {"zh-tw": " I'm now going to start this experiment. And what I just did is literallyshrunk myself a million times into the size of a molecule -- and it really feels like it,you have to try this.", "en": " 我準備開始進行這項實驗。 我剛剛做的就是，把我自己縮小到幾百萬倍， 縮到跟一個分子一樣的大小-- 各位真的要嘗試一下，真的很酷。"}, {"zh-tw": " So now it feels likeI'm standing inside the machine and I'm seeing all the DNA,and I see the molecules. I see the polymeraseand the enzymes and so forth.", "en": " 現在，我感覺好像站在儀器裡面， 看著所有的 DNA 及分子。 我看到聚合酶，還有酵素等等。"}, {"zh-tw": " And I can see how in this case, DNA is being replicated millions of times, just like it's happeninginside your body right now. And I can really feel and understandhow all of this works.", "en": " 我還可以看到， DNA 如何被複製好幾百萬倍出來， 就像各位身體裡面現在正在發生的事情一樣。 我真的可以感受並了解到這一切是如何運作的。"}, {"zh-tw": " Now, I hope that gives youa little bit of a sense of the possibilitiesin these new teaching methods. And I want to also emphasize that everything you just sawalso works on iPads and laptops without the headsets.", "en": " 現在，我希望可以給各位一些 關於這些新的教學方式的可行性。 我也想強調 各位剛剛看到的所有東西也可以在 iPad 及筆記型電腦上操作， 可以不用頭戴式裝置。"}, {"zh-tw": " I say that for a very important reason. In order for us to reallyempower and inspire the next generation of scientists, we really need teachersto drive the adoption of new technologies in the classroom.", "en": " 我說這是為了一個很重要的原因。 為了讓我們支持並鼓勵 我們的下一代對科學的熱情， 我們真的需要老師們在課堂上 主動採用新的科技教學方法。"}, {"zh-tw": " And so in many ways, I believe that the next big,quantum leap in science education lies no longer with the technology, but rather with the teachers' decision to push forward and adoptthese technologies inside the classrooms. And so it is our hope that moreuniversities and schools and teachers will collaborate with technology companies to realize this full potential.", "en": " 有了這麼多的方法， 我相信下一個科學教育的巨大突破 不再是靠科技， 而是靠老師們在課堂上推動並採用這些科技的決心。 所以我們希望， 可以更多的大學、學校、老師可以與科技公司合作 讓學生發揮出最大的潛力。"}, {"zh-tw": " And so, lastly, I'd like to leave youwith a little story that really inspires me. And that is the story of Jack Andraka.", "en": " 最後， 我想給各位講一個小故事， 一個激勵我的故事。 就是這位傑克．安佐卡的故事。"}, {"zh-tw": " Some of you might already know him. Jack invented a new, groundbreakinglow-cost test for pancreatic cancer at the age 15.", "en": " 你們有些人也許已經認識這個人。 傑克在他 15 歲的時候， 發明了一個新的、開創性、低成本、快速的胰腺癌測試試紙，"}, {"zh-tw": " And when Jack shares his storyof how he did this huge breakthrough, he also explains that one thingalmost prevented him from making this breakthrough. And that was that he did nothave access to real laboratories, because he was too inexperienced to be allowed in.", "en": " 在傑克分享他如何做出這個突破性發明的故事時， 他也說明了一件差點阻礙他做這項突破性發明的故事。 就是，他因為太年輕沒有經驗，所以不允許進到實驗室裡做實驗。"}, {"zh-tw": " Now, imagine if we could bring Ivy League, million-dollarvirtual laboratories out to all these students just like Jack, all over the world, and give them the latest, greatest,most fancy machines you can imagine that would quite literallymake any scientist in here jump up and down out of pure excitement. And then imagine how thatwould empower and inspire a whole new generationof young and bright scientists, ready to innovate and change the world.", "en": " 現在，想像一下，如果我們可以 把價值上百萬的常春藤大學的虛擬實驗室 帶到外面的世界給所有像是傑克這樣的學生， 讓他們也能接觸到最先進、最強大、最昂貴的儀器， 這會讓在場所有的科學家， 興奮地跳起來。 然後想像一下，那會如何支持並激勵到 全新一代的年輕聰明科學家們， 讓他們準備好創新並改變世界。"}, {"zh-tw": " Thank you very much.", "en": " 非常謝謝各位。"}], "title": "Michael Bodekaer This Virtual Lab Will Revolutionize Science Class"}
