Somebody was smartand put a Bic pen in my neck to open up my airway,so I could get some air in there."}, {"zh-tw": "我的肺也垮了有人幫我切開，放了些別針進去支撐以免造成嚴重災難不知怎的，我已經躺在醫院裡", "en": "And my lung collapsed, so somebody cut me openand put a pen in there as well, to stop that catastrophicevent from happening.

They needed to open upspace for somebody else that they thought could come back from whatever they were going through."}, {"zh-tw": "人人對我的康復都沒了信心基本上，他們像是在牆上掛了地圖，擲飛鏢決定結果我就進了一家科羅拉多州的老人院", "en": "Everybody lost faith in mebeing able to recover. So they basically put a mapup on the wall, threw a dart, and it landed at a senior home,here in Colorado."}, {"zh-tw": "我知道你們都在搔腦袋：「送到老人院？你到哪兒幹嘛？」但是，各位想一想今天在這房間裡所有的技能和才智都是老人院裡所擁有的所有這些技能和才智那些那些老人都有", "en": "And I know all of youare scratching your head: \"A senior citizens' home? What in the worldare you going to do there?\" But if you think aboutall of the skills and talent that are in this room right now, that's what a senior home has. So there were all these skills and talents that these seniors had."}, {"zh-tw": "其中他們勝過各位大多數的一個長處就是智慧因為他們的人生閱歷長我那時所需的正是那樣的智慧", "en": "The one advantagethey had over most of you is wisdom, because they had a long life. And I needed that wisdomat that moment in my life."}, {"zh-tw": "各位可以想像當時我出現在他們門前，對他們而言會是怎樣的情況那時我胖回了1.8公斤那就是將近31公斤", "en": "But imagine what it was like for them when I showed up at their doorstep. At that point, I had gainedfour pounds, so I was 68 pounds."}, {"zh-tw": "光頭身穿著醫院的寒酸院服", "en": "I was bald. I was wearing hospital scrubs."}, {"zh-tw": "腳穿著人家送的網球鞋一手持著白色盲人杖另一手提著滿箱的醫療記錄", "en": "And somebody donated tennis shoes for me. And I had a white cane in one hand and a suitcase full of medicalrecords in another hand."}, {"zh-tw": "因此，所有的老人們都知道他們需要召開一次緊急會議他們往後退了一下，對望了一會接著說「好啦，我們這房子裡有什麼辦法？這孩子有好多要弄。」他們最後開始搭配起他們的才智和技能為我提供所需的一切", "en": "So the senior citizens realized that they needed to havean emergency meeting. So they pulled backand they were looking at each other, and they were going, \"OK,what skills do we have in this room? This kid needs a lot of work.\" So they eventually startedmatching their talents and skills to all of my needs."}, {"zh-tw": "可是，他們首先要做的是確定我立即需要的是什麼我當時得學會像正常人那樣進食因為我一直是用一根穿過胸部的管子通過靜脈進食的", "en": "But one of the first thingsthey needed to do was assess what I needed right away. I needed to figure out how to eatlike a normal human being, since I'd been eatingthrough a tube in my chest and through my veins."}, {"zh-tw": "因此， 我得再重新學習如何進食他們帶著我走過那整個過程", "en": "So I had to gothrough trying to eat again. And they went through that process."}, {"zh-tw": "然後他們也發現：「啊，她需要家具她現在睡的是公寓的角落。」他們跑到儲物箱把多餘的家具湊在一起給我水壺、鍋子、毛氈的", "en": "And then they had to figure out: \"Well, she needs furniture. She is sleeping in the cornerof this apartment.\" So they went to their storage lockers and all gathered their extra furniture -- gave me pots and pans, blankets -- everything."}, {"zh-tw": "所有東西接下來，我需要的是添添妝，改改外型寒酸的綠色院服扔掉穿上化學纖維造的花衣", "en": "And then the next thing that I needed was a makeover. So out went the green scrubs, and in came the polyesterand floral prints."}, {"zh-tw": "我還沒說我頭髮長回來時，他們想強迫我做的髮型，但是我確實反對了把頭髮弄成藍色", "en": "We're not going to talkabout the hairstyles they tried to force on meonce my hair grew back. But I did say no to the blue hair."}, {"zh-tw": "事情還沒完，他們還決定我得重新學會說話如果不能說話、不能看見那就無法獨立生活", "en": "So eventually, what went on is, they decided that, well,I need to learn to speak. You can't be an independent person if you're not able to speakand you can't see."}, {"zh-tw": "他們發現要我讓能看見是一回事但他們得先讓我能說話所以，辦事處主管莎莉白天教我說話那可真困難，因為小時候，樣樣來得自然", "en": "So they figured not being ableto see is one thing, but they need to get me to talk. So while Sally, the office manager, was teaching me to speak in the day -- it's hard, because when you're a kid,you take things for granted."}, {"zh-tw": "不知覺中就學會了但是我當時已是成人，那有多難堪我還得學習如何協調新的嗓門和舌頭新的牙齒和嘴唇學習吸進氣來吐出話", "en": "You learn things unconsciously. But for me, I was an adultand it was embarrassing, and I had to learn how to coordinatemy new throat with my tongue and my new teeth and my lips, and capture the air and get the word out."}, {"zh-tw": "所以我就像兩歲小孩那樣拒絕服從但那些人有更好的主意", "en": "So, I acted like a two-year-old, and refused to work. But the men had a better idea."}, {"zh-tw": "他們為了讓我得到樂趣晚上就教我來「牙言齦語」的拼說遊戲", "en": "They were going to make it fun for me. So they were teaching mecuss-word Scrabble at night."}, {"zh-tw": "然後又偷偷教我如何像水手那樣罵人這裡，我準備讓各位想像一下當莎莉終於重建了我的自信後我首先說出來的是哪些話語", "en": "And then, secretly,how to swear like a sailor. I'm going to just leave itto your imagination as to what my first words were -- when Sally finally gotmy confidence built."}, {"zh-tw": "我就從那裡繼續前進有一位以前當老師的，他罹患了阿茲海默擔任教我寫字，這項多餘的學習", "en": "So I moved on from there. And a former teacherwho happened to have Alzheimer's took on the task of teaching me to write."}, {"zh-tw": "事實上對我幫助不小我們繼續向進", "en": "The redundancy was actually good for me. So, we'll just keep moving on."}, {"zh-tw": "其中有一個轉捩點就是讓我以一個盲人的身份重新學會過馬路請閉上眼睛，想像一下", "en": "One of the pivotal times for me was actually learningto cross the street again as a blind person. So close your eyes."}, {"zh-tw": "必須那樣過馬路的情況你不知道馬路有多寬你也不曉得能否筆直橫過", "en": "Now imagine you have to cross a street. You don't know how far that street is, and you don't knowif you're going straight."}, {"zh-tw": "你聽到那些車聲颼颼來往你還有過恐怖的意外讓你落得這步田地因此，我有兩個難關必須熬過", "en": "And you hear cars whizzing back and forth, and you had a horrible accident that landed you in this situation. So there were two obstaclesI had to get through."}, {"zh-tw": "一是嚴重創傷的後遺症每次走近街角或是路肩我會恐慌", "en": "One was post-traumatic stress disorder. Every time I approachedthe corner or the curb, I would panic."}, {"zh-tw": "再是真正嘗試要怎麼橫過馬路有位老人跑上前來她把我推到街角上，說：「你覺得可以跨出去的時候，把盲人杖伸出去", "en": "And the second one was actually trying to figure outhow to cross that street. So one of the seniors just came up to me, and she pushed meup to the corner and said, \"When you think it's time to go,just stick the cane out there."}, {"zh-tw": "要是被撞啦，不要過馬路。」說得有道理不過，用到第三根盲人杖時拐杖颼地飛過了馬路這下他們明白了要集中資源於是他們集資讓我進了布萊葉學院在那兒學得了盲人的技能也還取得了一隻導盲犬牠改變了我的生命", "en": "If it's hit, don't cross the street.\" Made perfect sense. But by the third canethat went whizzing across the road -- they realized that they neededto put their resources together, and they raised funds so that I could goto the Braille Institute and actually gain the skillsto be a blind person, and also to go get a guide dog, who transformed my life."}, {"zh-tw": "後來我能回到大學上課都是由於這些老人對我的投資以及那隻導盲犬和我所獲得的那些技能10年後，我重見光明", "en": "And I was able to return to college because of the senior citizenswho invested in me, and also the guide dogand skill set I had gained. Ten years later, I gained my sight back."}, {"zh-tw": "不是奇蹟我同意動了三個手術其中一個是實驗性質的實際上是機控手術他們從我的眼後取出血腫", "en": "Not magically -- I opted in for three surgeries, and one of them was experimental. It was actually robotic surgery that removed a hematomafrom behind my eye."}, {"zh-tw": "對我而言變化最大是整個世界往前進科技創新種種新的事物手機、筆記型電腦這些東西都是我以前沒見過的作為盲人的時候你的視覺記憶會減退會被你對物件的感覺所取代物件會發出什麼聲音", "en": "The biggest change for mewas that the world moved forward, that there were innovationsand all kinds of new things -- cellphones, laptops, all these thingsthat I had never seen before. And as a blind person, your visual memory fades, and is replaced with how youfeel about things and how things sound and how things smell."}, {"zh-tw": "物件有什麼氣味有一天，我在房間裡我看到這麼一個東西我以為是一頭怪物我繞著它走", "en": "So one day, I was in my room and I saw this thing sitting in my room. I thought it was a monster, so I was walking around it."}, {"zh-tw": "我想：我要摸摸它是什麼我摸了它，恍然大悟「天吶，那是個洗衣籃。」如果你看得見的話所有東西都不一樣因為你認為理所當然但如果你是盲眼的你對東西的記憶是觸覺的", "en": "And I go, \"I'm just going to touch it.\" And I touched it and I went, \"Oh my God, it's a laundry basket.\" Everything is differentwhen you're a sighted person, because you take that for granted. But when you're blind,you have the tactile memory for things."}, {"zh-tw": "我最大的改變是看著我的雙手看到我的生命失去了10年我想，出於某種緣故，時間靜止了對家人和朋友們而言，時間流逝", "en": "The biggest change for mewas looking down at my hands and seeing that I'd lost10 years of my life. I thought that timehad stood still for some reason and moved on for family and friends."}, {"zh-tw": "但當我看下去我明白了，時間也從我身上流逝我必須追趕", "en": "But when I looked down, I realized that timemarched on for me, too, and that I needed to get caught up. So I got going on it."}, {"zh-tw": "我得抓住它我發生意外時，並沒有「群眾幫忙」和「徹底協作」這些詞眼但概念是真實存在的人們協力讓我重生人們協力讓我重建", "en": "We didn't have words like \"crowdsourcing\"and \"radical collaboration\" when I had my accident. But the concept held true -- people working with people to rebuild me; people working with peopleto reeducate me."}, {"zh-tw": "我今天不可能站在這裡若非真有最大程度的「徹底協作」存在的話非常感謝(鼓掌)", "en": "I wouldn't be standing here today if it wasn't for extremeradical collaboration. Thank you so much."}], "title": "Ramona Pierson An Unexpected Place Of Healing"}
