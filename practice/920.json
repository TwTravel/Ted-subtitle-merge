My talk essentially got written by three historic events that happened within days of each other in the last two months -- seemingly unrelated, but as you will see, actually all having to do with the story I want to tell you today. The first one was actually a funeral -- to be more precise, a reburial.", "en": " 我很幸運,因為 我的演講稿是由 過去兩個月中,連續發生的三件 和歷史相關的新聞事件 所串連而成 看起來沒關連 但是接下來你們會明白 它們其實全都和我今天所要講的故事有關 第一個事件是一個喪禮 精確一點的說,是「重埋」"}, {"zh-tw": " On May 22nd, there was a hero's reburial in Frombork, Poland of the 16th-century astronomer who actually changed the world. He did that, literally, by replacing the Earth with the Sun in the center of the Solar System, and then with this simple-looking act, he actually launched a scientific and technological revolution, which many call the Copernican Revolution.", "en": " 5月22號 在波蘭的弗龍堡 有位16世紀天文學英雄,獲得重埋 他,曾因為確立了 太陽系的「日心說」 取代「地心說」 改變了世界 簡單的一個觀點改變 引發了科技革命 你可以稱之為 哥白尼革命"}, {"zh-tw": " Now that was, ironically, and very befittingly, the way we found his grave. As it was the custom of the time, Copernicus was actually simply buried in an unmarked grave, together with 14 others in that cathedral.", "en": " 那革命 和後來怎樣找到哥白尼本人的墳墓 非常有關 按哥白尼時代的風俗 他和其他14個人 無名無姓的 一同合葬在 天主教堂地窖墳墓中"}, {"zh-tw": " DNA analysis, one of the hallmarks of the scientific revolution of the last 400 years that he started, was the way we found which set of bones actually belonged to the person who read all those astronomical books which were filled with leftover hair that was Copernicus' hair -- obviously not many other people bothered to read these books later on. That match was unambiguous.", "en": " 而DNA比對,正是 他所發動的這場400年革命 所留下最偉大的 劃時代特徵印記之一 最終也成為,幫我們找到 他本人骸骨的關鍵 從他讀過的天文學書籍中 所遺留的頭髮 比對過DNA後 我們在一堆骸骨中確認哪些屬哥白尼所有 而不可能是其他人 畢竟在他之後,舊的天文學書也無人再看 鑑定結果,很明確是吻合"}, {"zh-tw": " The DNA matched, and we know that this was indeed Nicolaus Copernicus. Now, the connection between biology and DNA and life is very tantalizing when you talk about Copernicus because, even back then, his followers very quickly made the logical step to ask: if the Earth is just a planet, then what about planets around other stars? What about the idea of the plurality of the worlds, about life on other planets? In fact, I'm borrowing here from one of those very popular books of the time.", "en": " DNA比對 使我們確實知道 哪些骨頭是屬於尼古拉哥白尼本人所有 不過,生物學和DNA 及生命之間有關連性 並且 和哥白尼有所相關是怎麼回事呢? 我們知道,即便是在哥白尼時代 他的跟隨者也已經知道 下一步邏輯推論必然是 「如果,地球只是繞行太陽的行星 那麼其他繞行其他恆星的行星在哪裡呢?」 「世界」這個概念,從此成為複數而非單數嗎? 還有,在其他那些星球上的生命是什麼樣的呢? 我在這裡所借用的當時看法 都參考自哥白尼時相當受歡迎的一本書"}, {"zh-tw": " And at the time, people actually answered that question positively: \"Yes.\" But there was no evidence.

What is the origin of life? Are we alone?\" And that especially happened in the last 10 years, at the end of the 20th century, when the beautiful developments due to molecular biology, understanding the code of life, DNA, all of that seemed to actually put us, not closer, but further apart from answering those basic questions. Now, the good news.", "en": " 生命是什麼？生命從何而來？ 人類是唯一而孤單的嗎？ 尤其來到20世紀末 的最後10年 分子生物學 有了璀璨的發現 使我們了解生命的密碼、DNA 所有這些發現非但 未能使人類更靠近答案 反而更進一步將我們推離 距離這些基本答案越來越遠 然後,好消息開始"}, {"zh-tw": " A lot has happened in the last few years, and let's start with the planets.

Our team, befittingly I think, named it after one of those dreamers of the Copernican time, Johannes Kepler, and that telescope's sole purpose is to go out, find the planets that orbit other stars in our galaxy, and tell us how often do planets like our own Earth happen to be out there.", "en": " 一架新的望遠鏡 我們恰如其分的 依一位哥白尼時代的夢想家 為它命名 (約翰尼斯)「開普勒望遠鏡」 這座望遠鏡的唯一目的就是 出發,去尋找 銀河系中繞行 除太陽以外其他恆星的行星 並捎回信息告訴我們說 銀河系裡,還有多少類似地球的行星"}, {"zh-tw": " The telescope is actually built similarly to the, well-known to you, Hubble Space Telescope, except it does have an additional lens -- a wide-field lens, as you would call it as a photographer. And if, in the next couple of months, you walk out in the early evening and look straight up and place you palm like this, you will actually be looking at the field of the sky where this telescope is searching for planets day and night, without any interruption, for the next four years.", "en": " 這座望遠鏡 和知名的 哈柏太空望遠鏡很類似 但它捨棄了哈柏其中一個 寬視角鏡頭 (或稱為照相機) 接下來幾個月 入夜後你可走到戶外 抬頭仰望向天 並將你的手掌像這樣舉起 那塊天空正是 這座望遠鏡 未來四年將日以繼夜的 不停的搜索的區域"}, {"zh-tw": " The way we do that, actually, is with a method, which we call the transit method. It's actually mini-eclipses that occur when a planet passes in front of its star.", "en": " 我們所使用的方式是 「凌日法」 是迷你級的日蝕現象 發生在行星飛越過恆星面前時"}, {"zh-tw": " Not all of the planets will be fortuitously oriented for us to be able do that, but if you have a million stars, you'll find enough planets.

All the stars for Kepler are just points of light.", "en": " 我們並不是要看看到恆星和行星的清晰影像 所有恆星對開普勒而言都僅只是光點而已"}, {"zh-tw": " But we learn a lot from that: not only that there is a planet there, but we also learn its size. How much of the light is being dimmed depends on how big the planet is.", "en": " 但從光點的資料使我們能明白很多 不僅只是那裏有一顆行星而已,還有尺寸大小 光變暗的程度高低 取決於行星是大還小"}, {"zh-tw": " We learn about its orbit, the period of its orbit and so on.

Well, let me try to walk you through what we actually see and so you understand the news that I'm here to tell you today.", "en": " 也能得知它的軌道 軌道的週期如何等等 所以結論是 我接下來解釋我們的研究方法 然後你會明白 我最後要分享的新聞 那是今天的重點"}, {"zh-tw": " What Kepler does is discover a lot of candidates, which we then follow up and find as planets, confirm as planets.

Up until recently, that was the Solar System -- four Earth-like planets with small radius, smaller than about two times the size of the Earth -- and that was of course Mercury, Venus, Mars, and of course the Earth, and then the two big, giant planets.", "en": " 即便是在伊比鳩魯時代 人們就已知行星是有小,有大的 或哥白尼時期的人 當然也知道 稍後有了有太陽系概念 共有4個類似地球的行星 半徑較小,小於地球兩倍以下的就算小 這包括了水星 金星,火星 以及地球本身 以及兩顆巨型行星"}, {"zh-tw": " Then the Copernican Revolution brought in telescopes, and of course three more planets were discovered. Now the total planet number in our solar system was nine.", "en": " 哥白尼帶來 望遠鏡革命 然後又有兩三個行星被發現 當時太陽系行星數量 是9個"}, {"zh-tw": " The small planets dominated, and there was a certain harmony to that, which actually Copernicus was very happy to note, and Kepler was one of the big proponents of. So now we have Pluto to join the numbers of small planets.", "en": " 大多數以小行星為主 哥白尼很開心的注意到 大小比例之間有某種合諧性 開普勒望遠鏡是這個假設的大力支持者 當時冥王星仍被歸為小行星一類"}, {"zh-tw": " But up until, literally, 15 years ago, that was all we knew about planets. And that's what the frustration was.", "en": " 但直到15年前 我們對行星的知識僅止於此 哥白尼的夢想"}, {"zh-tw": " The Copernican dream was unfulfilled. Finally, 15 years ago, the technology came to the point where we could discover a planet around another star, and we actually did pretty well.", "en": " 仍然沒能實現 15年前，我們的技術 終於達到一個程度 能夠發現一個行星圍繞另一顆恆星 一切進行的相當不錯"}, {"zh-tw": " In the next 15 years, almost 500 planets were discovered orbiting other stars, with different methods. Unfortunately, as you can see, there was a very different picture.", "en": " 15年來，透過各種不同方法發現 一共將近500個行星 這些行星環繞其他恆星 不過，從這邊你會發現到 這個景象和我們所期待的非常不同"}, {"zh-tw": " There was of course an explanation for it: We only see the big planets, so that's why most of those planets are really in the category of \"like Jupiter.\" But you see, we haven't gone very far. We were still back where Copernicus was.", "en": " 我們只看到大的行星 這現象背後,當然有可解釋的原因 但,總之,大部分我們觀測到的行星 都歸在類木星這一類 無論如何其實我們仍在原地踏步 離哥白尼時期已經400年,進展卻不多"}, {"zh-tw": " We didn't have any evidence whether planets like the Earth are out there. And we do care about planets like the Earth because by now we understood that life as a chemical system really needs a smaller planet with water and with rocks and with a lot of complex chemistry to originate, to emerge, to survive.", "en": " 我們仍然沒有證據可以顯示 像地球一樣的行星確實存在 這件事對我們很重要,因為 現在我們所明白的是,生命 有如一個化學體系般 它需要比較小的行星 有水有土壤岩石 以及一些相當複雜的化學 然後生命得以起源,出現,生存"}, {"zh-tw": " And we didn't have the evidence for that. So today, I'm here to actually give you a first glimpse of what the new telescope, Kepler, has been able to tell us in the last few weeks, and, lo and behold, we are back to the harmony and to fulfilling the dreams of Copernicus.", "en": " 但我們獨缺證據 今天我在這裡要向各位說明的就是 最新的開普勒望遠鏡 在過去幾週當中的新發現 非常令人驚訝的,你將看到 我們回到了哥白尼所夢想的 大小行星,呈現"}, {"zh-tw": " You can see here, the small planets dominate the picture.

It's about 100 million such planets.", "en": " 您或許已經猜的出來 是頗為驚人的: 大約有一億顆!"}, {"zh-tw": " That's great news. Why? Because with our own little telescope, just in the next two years, we'll be able to identify at least 60 of them. So that's great because then we can go and study them -- remotely, of course -- with all the techniques that we already have tested in the past five years.", "en": " 這是大好的消息,不是嗎? 運用這樣小小的望遠鏡 短短兩年的觀測 就發現了60個初步符合條件的行星 這當然是好消息 因為我們會繼續 當然是,用遠距的方式 用一些現有的技術 在過去五年中已經測試過的"}, {"zh-tw": " We can find what they're made of, would their atmospheres have water, carbon dioxide, methane.

That's not why I'm here.", "en": " 這聽起來很棒,但他還不算是全部 這還不是今天所要講的重點"}, {"zh-tw": " Why I'm here is to tell you that the next step is really the exciting part. The one that this step is enabling us to do is coming next.", "en": " 今天要談的是我們的下一步 是真正令人振奮的好消息 這下一步 能帶領我們預備好迎接更後面將來的"}, {"zh-tw": " And here comes biology -- biology, with its basic question, which still stands unanswered, which is essentially: \"If there is life on other planets, do we expect it to be like life on Earth?\" And let me immediately tell you here, when I say life, I don't mean \"dolce vita,\" good life, human life. I really mean life on Earth, past and present, from microbes to us humans, in its rich molecular diversity, the way we now understand life on Earth as being a set of molecules and chemical reactions -- and we call that, collectively, biochemistry, life as a chemical process, as a chemical phenomenon.", "en": " 那就是生物 在生物學領域,還有基本問題 仍然未獲解答 而那就是 「如果其他星球上是有生命的話 我們是否認為它會和地球生物一樣?」 我想先表達一件事 這裡所說「生命」,並非 等同於「快樂生活著」這種人類的生命 我所指的生命是: 過去,現在和未來在地球上 從微生物到人類 具有豐富的分子多樣性 以我們現在所明白的在地球上的生命形式 有著成組的分子和彼此化學反應 我們統稱為,生物化學 生命是一個化學過程 是一個化學上的現象"}, {"zh-tw": " So the question is: is that chemical phenomenon universal, or is it something which depends on the planet? Is it like gravity, which is the same everywhere in the universe, or there would be all kinds of different biochemistries wherever we find them? We need to know what we are looking for when we try to do that. And that's a very basic question, which we don't know the answer to, but which we can try -- and we are trying -- to answer in the lab.", "en": " 所以問題是 這樣的化學現象是否具有普及全宇宙皆準的一致性? 抑或是 它將因個別星球而異? 它會像重力原理一樣 在宇宙中任何一處都適用? 還是宇宙間充滿形形色色,大異其趣的許多生物化學 各隨其所在環境而變異? 在我們嘗試新探索以前 必須先知道我們想要找的是什麼 那是非常基礎,而我們不知道其答案為何的問題 但可以嘗試 可以先在實驗室裡嘗試"}, {"zh-tw": " We don't need to go to space to answer that question. And so, that's what we are trying to do.", "en": " 不需要在太空中嘗試 有些問題是可以先取得答案的 那就是我們所在做的試驗"}, {"zh-tw": " And that's what many people now are trying to do. And a lot of the good news comes from that part of the bridge that we are trying to build as well.", "en": " 也是許多人正在努力嘗試的 這像是一座通往某處的橋樑 在一邊造橋的過程,我們已經聽見有些好消息傳來"}, {"zh-tw": " So this is one example that I want to show you here. When we think of what is necessary for the phenomenon that we call life, we think of compartmentalization, keeping the molecules which are important for life in a membrane, isolated from the rest of the environment, but yet, in an environment in which they actually could originate together.", "en": " 這裡有一個例子 我想和各位分享 我們一向以為 要起始生命這種奇妙的現象 分室作用是必須的 它會把對生命而言,有重要性的分子 個別包裹在膜裡面 使它與週遭環境隔絕開來 但我們發現,在一個環境中 這些分子事實上可以一起共同產生"}, {"zh-tw": " And in one of our labs, Jack Szostak's labs, it was a series of experiments in the last four years that showed that the environments -- which are very common on planets, on certain types of planets like the Earth, where you have some liquid water and some clays -- you actually end up with naturally available molecules which spontaneously form bubbles. But those bubbles have membranes very similar to the membrane of every cell of every living thing on Earth looks like, like this.", "en": " 這是由我們的一個實驗室 傑克史塔克實驗室 過去四年 進行一系列的實驗中所得到的發現 有些和地球環境 條件相類似的行星 在那裡 有些水,和土壤 然後 很自然的有些分子出現 自發性的形成了泡沫 這些泡沫所具有的膜 和每一個地球生物所具有的 細胞的膜是非常類似 像這樣"}, {"zh-tw": " And they really help molecules, like nucleic acids, like RNA and DNA, stay inside, develop, change, divide and do some of the processes that we call life. Now this is just an example to tell you the pathway in which we are trying to answer that bigger question about the universality of the phenomenon.", "en": " 這對於分子形成 對核酸,核糖核酸和DNA 在其中發展 變化,分裂 以及進行一些我們稱為生命的過程都很有幫助 這是其中一個例子 用來說明我們前進所採取途徑 是我們用來宏觀回答 生命現象具有什麼普遍原則的途徑之一"}, {"zh-tw": " And in a sense, you can think of that work that people are starting to do now around the world as building a bridge, building a bridge from two sides of the river. On one hand, on the left bank of the river, are the people like me who study those planets and try to define the environments.", "en": " 某種程度上,你可以將目前 世界各地人們為此所進行的這些相關工作 比喻成搭建一座橋樑 彼此各從河的兩岸搭一座橋 一方,在左岸 有些研究行星的人,如我 試著定義生命合適的環境為何"}, {"zh-tw": " We don't want to go blind because there's too many possibilities, and there is not too much lab, and there is not enough human time to actually to do all the experiments. So that's what we are building from the left side of the river.", "en": " 可能性太多,我們不能盲目以赴 實驗室的資源 人力時間 都不允許我們一一完成所有實驗 這就是左岸的工作人員在努力嘗試的部份"}, {"zh-tw": " From the right bank of the river are the experiments in the lab that I just showed you, where we actually tried that, and it feeds back and forth, and we hope to meet in the middle one day.

Well, there are many reasons, and you heard some of them in the short talk today.", "en": " 從右岸 有我剛剛展現給各位看的那種實驗正在進行 我們可以試圖看這樣來回互通有無 希望有一天能在中間點相會 但是,請問你為什麼要聽我 對你兜售一個才建了一半 一半都還不到的橋? 靠我的帥氣魅力嗎? 原因有很多 今天的短講中 有一部分原因你已經聽過了"}, {"zh-tw": " This understanding of chemistry actually can help us with our daily lives. But there is something more profound here, something deeper.", "en": " 對化學的更多了解 事實上不僅在日常生活上 能幫助我們 它其實是有更豐富 更深層的意義"}, {"zh-tw": " And that deeper, underlying point is that science is in the process of redefining life as we know it. And that is going to change our worldview in a profound way -- not in a dissimilar way as 400 years ago, Copernicus' act did, by changing the way we view space and time.", "en": " 這更深層的基本論點是在於: 科學 就是將已知的生命定義 重新定義的一個過程 這將極大的改變我們的 世界觀 與400年前的世界觀 真正有所不同 哥白尼的革命 改變了我們 看待時間和空間的觀點"}, {"zh-tw": " Now it's about something else, but it's equally profound. And half the time, what's happened is it's related this kind of sense of insignificance to humankind, to the Earth in a bigger space.", "en": " 現在這個新革命,重點雖不同 但意涵很豐富是無庸置疑的 一半 是關於 人類的 渺小 小地球和大宇宙 無可比擬的微不足道"}, {"zh-tw": " And the more we learn, the more that was reinforced.
