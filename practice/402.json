Once upon a time, I did a book called \"How Buildings Learn.\" Today's event you might call \"How Mountains Teach.\" A little background: For 10 years I've been trying to figure out how to hack civilization so that we can get long-term thinking to be automatic and common instead of difficult and rare -- or in some cases, non-existent.", "en": " 歡迎來到一萬英尺高的地方 讓我解釋一下我們為什麼會在這兒 還有為什麼有些人手邊有松果 我曾經寫過一本書，叫做 \" 建築物如何學習.\" 今天的演說則可以叫做 \"山脈如何教導我們\" 先介紹一點故事背景 : 過去十年來，我一直都在想辦法要如何 應付現代文明，好讓\"長程思考\"可以 變得普及且自然，而不是像現在一樣鮮為人知且難以實現 或在某些情況下，根本是不存在的"}, {"zh-tw": " It would be helpful if humanity got into the habit of thinking of the now not just as next week or next quarter, but you know, next 10,000 years and the last 10,000 years -- basically civilization's story so far. So we have the Long Now Foundation in San Francisco.", "en": " 如果人類可以習慣性地把當下想到 不只是下週、下一季，而是 下一個一萬年，及之後的幾個一萬年 也就是迄今人類文明演進歷史 所以我們在舊金山有永續基金會"}, {"zh-tw": " It's an incubator for about a dozen projects, all having to do with continuity over the long term. Our core project is a rather ambitious folly -- I suppose, a mythic undertaking: to build a 10,000-year clock that can really keep good time for that long a period.", "en": " 這基金會孕育、推動許多計劃 每個計劃都和永續有關 我們的核心計劃是蠻天馬行空的 我想是有如登天般的艱鉅任務：建造萬年鐘 真的可以走一萬年的時鐘"}, {"zh-tw": " And the design problems of a project like that are just absolutely delicious. Go to the clock. And what we have here is something many of you saw here three years ago.", "en": " 而這個計畫在設計上的問題就更有趣了 看一下這個時鐘 有些人在三年前已經看過了"}, {"zh-tw": " It's the first working prototype of the clock. It's about nine feet high.", "en": " 這是我們做的第一個可以運行的萬年鐘原型 差不多有2.7公尺高"}, {"zh-tw": " Designed by Danny Hillis and Alexander Rose. It's presently in London, and is ticking away very deliberately at the science museum there. So the design problem for today is going to be, how do you house an eventual monumental clock like this so it can really tick, save time beautifully for 100 centuries? Well, this was the first solution.", "en": " 這是由丹尼希利斯和亞歷山大蘿絲設計，目前置於倫敦 在科學博物館裡安靜地滴答走著 所以現在設計上主要的難題是 要怎樣安置一個像這樣不朽的鐘 讓它可以安穩，精準地運行100個世紀之久 這是第一個方案"}, {"zh-tw": " Alexander Rose came up with this idea of a spiraloid tower with continuous sloping ramps. And it looked like a way to go, until you start thinking about, what does deep time do to a building? Well, this is what deep time does to a building.", "en": " 亞歷山大蘿絲想出這個方法 造一個由數個斜坡形成螺旋狀的塔 這想法看起來似乎可行，但思考以後 建築物在時間的摧殘之下會有什麼結果呢? 這是一個例子"}, {"zh-tw": " This is the Parthenon. It's only 2,450 years old, and look what happened to it. Here's a beautiful project. They really knew it'd last forever, because they'd build it out of absolutely huge stones.", "en": " 這是巴森農神殿，它才經過2450年而已 就變成這樣子 這是個超棒的構思，他們知道這些石頭可以經過時間的考驗 因為他們完全是用巨大的石塊所建的"}, {"zh-tw": " And now it's a pathetic ruin and no one even knows what it was used for. That's what happens to buildings. They're vulnerable.", "en": " 可惜現在看起來像是廢墟一般，沒有人知道這當初的用途為何 建築物就是如此的脆弱"}, {"zh-tw": " Even the most durable and intactable buildings, like the pyramids of Giza, are in bad shape when you look up close. They've been looted inside and out.", "en": " 即使是最持久，堅固的建築物也是如此 像吉薩金字塔，如果你靠近看，已經殘破不堪了 從裡到外都被劫空了"}, {"zh-tw": " And they're built to protect things but they don't protect things. So we got to thinking, if you can't put things safely in a building, where can you safely put them? We thought, OK, underground.", "en": " 本來吉薩金字塔的功能 - \"保護東西\"- 已經失去了 所以我們要想，如果一個建築物都不能保護東西 哪裡可以呢? 後來我們想到，不如埋到地面下"}, {"zh-tw": " How about underground with a view? Underground in a place that's really solid. So the obvious answer was, we need a mountain.", "en": " 裝一個可以透視的窗口 埋在一個非常堅實的地表之下 所以最好的答案，我們需要一座山"}, {"zh-tw": " You don't want just any mountain. You need absolutely the right mountain if you're going to have a clock for 10,000 years.", "en": " 不是隨便的一座山 而要合適的山 只有那樣才能存放萬年鐘"}, {"zh-tw": " So here's an image of the long view of the search problem. And we got to thinking for various reasons it ought to be a desert mountain, so we got looking in the dry areas of the Southwest.", "en": " 於是，我們又遇到了搜尋合適地點的問題 基於多方面的考量，我們認為必須是沙漠地帶的山 所以我們找到了美國西南地區"}, {"zh-tw": " We looked at mesas in New Mexico. We were looking at dead volcanoes in Arizona.", "en": " 新墨西哥州的臺地 現在看到的是亞利桑那州的死火山"}, {"zh-tw": " Then Roger Kennedy, who was the director of the National Parks Service, led us to Eastern Nevada, to America's newest and oldest national park, which is called Great Basin National Park. It's right on the eastern border of Nevada.", "en": " 然後這個國家公園的負責人羅傑‧甘迺迪 帶我們到內華達東部 全美國最年輕也最古老的國家公園 －大盆地國家公園 這個國家公園正好坐落在內華達州的東側的邊境上"}, {"zh-tw": " It's the highest range in the state -- over 13,000 feet.

It's over 200 miles from any major city. It's nowhere near any Interstate or railroad.", "en": " 這個地方非常偏遠，離任何一個周邊的大城市都有三百多公里 旁邊也沒任何州際公路或是鐵路"}, {"zh-tw": " And it's -- the only thing that goes by is what's called America's loneliest highway, U.S. 50.

We're in Pole Canyon, looking west up the western escarpment of Mount Washington, which is 11,600 feet on top.", "en": " 讓我們看看裡面有什麼吧 我們現在在Pole峽谷，西眺華盛頓山脈的 西側懸崖，有3500多公尺之高"}, {"zh-tw": " Those white cliffs are a dense Cambrian limestone. That's a 2,000-foot thick formation, and it might be a beautiful place to hide a clock.", "en": " 那些白色懸崖是由寒武紀石灰岩構成的 有600公尺厚 應該會是藏鐘的好地點"}, {"zh-tw": " It would be a pilgrimage to get to it; it would be a serious hike to get up to where the clock is. So last June, the Long Now board, some staff and some donors and advisors, made a two-week expedition to the mountain to explore it and investigate, one, if it's the right mountain, and two, if it's the right mountain, how it might actually work for us.", "en": " 只有像是朝聖的登山客才會來到這種地方 發現到萬年鐘 所以去年6月永續的董事會成員，職員、贊助者 以及一些顧問花了兩週在那考察 其一，想去調查看看這是不是合適的山 其二，如果是的話，那該要如何的規劃"}, {"zh-tw": " Now Danny Hillis sort of framed the problem. He has a theory of how the overall clock experience should work.", "en": " 丹尼希利斯從另一個角度切入這個難題 他有一套關於這個時鐘該怎麼運行的理論"}, {"zh-tw": " It's what he calls the seven stages of a mythic adventure. It starts with the image. The image is a picture you have in your mind of the goal at the end of the journey.", "en": " 他把它稱之為神秘的冒險，總共有7個階段 第一個是圖像，就是你腦海中浮現的畫面 也就是在旅途終點你希望看到的目標"}, {"zh-tw": " In this case it might well be an image of the clock. Then there's the point of embarkation, that is, the point of transition from ordinary life to being a pilgrim on a quest.", "en": " 在這個例子裡，就是一個鐘的圖像 再來就是啟程，這是一個轉折點 從一般的生活蛻變到一個朝聖的旅程"}, {"zh-tw": " Then -- this is a nice image of it, there's the labyrinth. The labyrinth is a concept, it's like a twilight zone, it's a place where it's difficult, where you get disoriented, maybe you get scared -- but you have to go through it if you're going to get to some kind of deep reintegration.", "en": " 然後，這是一張不錯的圖像，這裡有一個迷宮 這迷宮是個概念，有點像是一個幽暗地帶 是一個複雜，會讓人在裡面迷路的地方 走進去一開始或許會害怕，但是得必須撐過去 如此才能抵達類似深層融合地帶"}, {"zh-tw": " Then there should always be in sight the draw -- a kind of a beacon that draws you on through the labyrinth to finish the process of getting there. Now Brian Eno, who's been in the thick of the Long Now process, spent two years making a C.D. called \"January 7003,\" and it's \"Bell Studies for the Clock of the Long Now.\" Based on -- parts of it are based on an algorithm that Danny Hillis developed, so that a peal of 10 bells makes a different peal every day for 10,000 years.", "en": " 然後視線之內應該要有一個像燈塔的東西 來引領你走過這個迷宮 來到達目的地 音樂人布萊恩·伊諾，他全程參與了這個永續計畫 花了兩年的時間製作一張專輯，『7003的一月 以及\" 關於萬年鐘的貝爾研究.\" 其中一部份是根據丹尼希利斯的演算方法製成的 所以10個鐘一組的編鐘 可以一萬年每天都發出不同的鐘聲"}, {"zh-tw": " The Hillis algorithm. 10 factorial gives you that number. And in fact, pretty soon we'll hear the sound.", "en": " 希利斯的演算方法, 透過10的階乘可以給你這個數字 實際上，我們馬上就可以聽到聲音"}, {"zh-tw": " January 7003. There it is. OK, back to Danny's list.", "en": " 7003的一月，就是這個聲音 我們回來到希利斯的7個階段"}, {"zh-tw": " Number five of the seven is the payoff. This is it. The climax. The goal. The main thing that you're trying to get to.", "en": " 第5個階段是修成正果的時候，就是這個高潮的時刻 終於到達了你的努力的目標"}, {"zh-tw": " And then Danny says a really great journey will have a secret payoff. Something you didn't expect that caps what you did expect.", "en": " 後來希利斯說了，一個每一個偉大的旅程都會有一個外人不得而知的收穫 一個你意想不到的收穫"}, {"zh-tw": " Then there's the return. You've got to have a gradual return to the ordinary world, so you have time to assimilate what you've learned.", "en": " 再下來的階段就是-回歸 你漸漸地必須從旅途回到一般的生活 這樣才有時間慢慢體會這中間學到了些什麼"}, {"zh-tw": " And then, how about a memento? Number seven. At the end of it there's something physical, a kind of reward that you take away.", "en": " 最後，第七個-留念 再最後會有一些實質上的回饋 那種你可以帶走的回饋"}, {"zh-tw": " It might be a piece of a core drill of the mountain. Something that's just yours.", "en": " 或許是一個開山的鑽頭 或是一些你可以擁有的東西"}, {"zh-tw": " How do you study a mountain for the kinds of things we're talking about? This is not a normal building project. What do you look for? What are the elements that will most affect your ideas and decisions? Start with borders. If you look on the left side of the cliffs here, that's national park. That's sacrosanct -- you can't do anything with that. To the right of it is national forest.", "en": " 要怎麼用剛剛我們講的東西 來研究一座山脈呢? 這並不是一般的建築策劃 目標是什麼? 會有什麼因素來改變你的想法和決定呢? 我們從山沿開始看起，如果你這峭壁的左側 是國家公園，沒法動的 右邊是國家森林區"}, {"zh-tw": " There's possibilities. The borders are important. Other elements were mines, weather, approaches and elevation.", "en": " 是有可能，但在邊界上要很小心 其他的因素還有-礦井、天氣、進去的難度和攀登的高度"}, {"zh-tw": " And especially trees. Look at those things up on top there. It turns out that Mount Washington is covered with bristlecone pines.", "en": " 還有特別是- 樹，我們看看上面 後來我們發現在華盛頓山脈覆蓋了一層針毬松"}, {"zh-tw": " They're the world's oldest living thing. People think they're just the size of shrubs, but that's not actually true.", "en": " 這是全世界最老的生物 大家會認會不就根一般的灌木大小一樣嗎? 但是這不對"}, {"zh-tw": " There are trees on that mountain that are 5,000 years old and still living. The wood is so solid it's like stone, and it lasts for a long time.", "en": " 上面有些針毬松活了超過5000年，而且還活著 樹木跟石頭一樣硬，而且可以活很久"}, {"zh-tw": " So when you do tree ring studies of trunks that are on the mountain, some of them go back 10,000 years. The stone itself is absolutely beautiful, sculpted by millennia of very tough winters up there.", "en": " 所以當你去上去研究樹輪年代時 你會發現有些甚至活了超過一萬年 這\"石頭\"本身也非常漂亮 經過了幾千年的風霜的雕塑"}, {"zh-tw": " We had tree ring analysts from the University of Arizona join us on the expedition. Now, if you guys have a pine cone handy, now's a good time to put it in your hand and feel it, especially on the end.", "en": " 我們有來自亞歷桑那大學的樹輪專家 加入我們的探勘隊 現在，如果你們手邊有松球 現在正是時候可以放在手上，去感受它，特別是在尾端的地方"}, {"zh-tw": " That's interesting. You'll find out why it's called a bristlecone pine. A little sensory experience.", "en": " 非常有趣地 你會非現在為什麼它們叫針毬松，可以感覺的到"}, {"zh-tw": " Here's Danny Hillis in the midst of a bristlecone pine forest on Long Now land. I should say that the age of bristlecones was discovered, led by a theory. Edmund Schulman in the 1950s had been studying trees under great stress at Timberline, and came to the realization that he put in an article in Science magazine called, \"Longevity under Adversity in Conifers.\" And then, based on that principle, he started looking around at the various trees at Timberline, and realized that the bristlecone pines -- he found some in the White Mountains that were over 4,000 years old.", "en": " 這張是在針毬松樹林裡的丹尼希利斯 在永續基金會的領地上。我剛剛應該講，這個針毬松的年齡的算法 是有一個理論的 艾德瑪舒曼在1950年代 研究在樹帶界線上的樹木(這些樹木承受比較大的壓力) 然後把他的研究成果發表在<科學>雜誌裡 叫做\" 困境造就的長壽針葉樹\" 然後，根據這個理論，他開始觀察 其他也在樹帶界線上的的樹木 然後才發現在懷特山脈的針毬松 已經有4000多年的歷史了"}, {"zh-tw": " Longevity under adversity is a pretty interesting design principle in its own right. OK, onto the mines. The first asking price for the property when we looked at it in 1998 was one billion dollars for 180 acres and a couple of mines.", "en": " 困境造就的長壽本身也是很有趣的理論 好，再來是礦井 我們1998年第一次看的時候，要價是十億元可以買180英畝及裡面的一些礦井"}, {"zh-tw": " Because the owner said, \"There's one billion dollars of beryllium in that mountain.\" And we said, \"Wow, that's great. Listen, we'll counter. How about zero? And we're a non-profit foundation, you can give us the property and take a hell of a tax deduction. All you have to do is prove to the government it's worth a billion dollars.\" Well, a few years went by and there was some kind of back and forth, and by and by, thanks to Mitch and Jay, we were able to buy the whole property for 140,000 dollars.", "en": " 因為賣方說\" 山裡面有值十億元的鈹\" 然後我們說\"哇！太棒了。聽著，我們覺的不妥，可以免費給我們嗎? (笑聲） 我們是非營利的組織，你可以給我們這塊地 然後又可以拿來減稅 (笑聲） 你唯一要做的事就是像政府證明這山的確有價值十億元” 後來，我們討價還價了幾年後 也謝謝米奇和傑 我們終於用了14萬美金買了那塊地"}, {"zh-tw": " This is one of the mines. It doesn't have any beryllium in it. It's called the Pole Adit. And it does have tungsten, a little bit of tungsten, left over, that's the kind of mine it was.", "en": " 這是其中一個礦井，裡面根本沒有鈹 叫做Pole Adit，但是有鎢礦 一些殘留的鎢礦，之前含有的礦就是這種"}, {"zh-tw": " But it goes a mile-and-a-half in a straight line, due east into the range, into very interesting territory -- except that, as you'll see when we go inside in a minute, we were hoping for limestone but in there is just shale. And shale is not quite completely competent rock.", "en": " 但是這些鎢礦在直線一英里的深處 一直延伸到東邊一個非常奇特的地方 你們馬上會看到 我們本來想說會看到石灰岩，但是在裡面的卻是頁岩 頁岩並不是很堅硬的岩石"}, {"zh-tw": " Competent rock is rock that will hold itself up without any shoring. The shale would like some shoring, and so parts of it are caved in in there.", "en": " 堅硬的岩石不用任何支撐物就可以穩定在那 頁岩是要支撐物的 所以頁岩的某些部份是陷在山壁裡面的"}, {"zh-tw": " That's Ben Roberts from -- he's the bat specialist from the National Park. But there are many wonders back in there, like this weird fungus on some of the collapsed timbers.", "en": " 這是這個國家公園的蝙蝠專家－班羅伯茲 除此之外裡面還有很多奇景，像這些奇怪的真菌 就直接長在這些倒下的樹木上"}, {"zh-tw": " OK, here's another mine that's up on top of the property, and it dates back to 1870. That's what the property was originally built around -- it was a set of mining claims. It was a very productive silver mine.", "en": " 這是另一個礦井，在山頭上 可追朔到1870年 這就一開始在這土地開發礦山的原因 當時有非常豐富的銀礦"}, {"zh-tw": " In fact, it was the highest-operating mine in Nevada, and it ran year round. You can imagine what it was like in the winter at 10,000 feet.", "en": " 事實上，這是當時內華達州開採最盛的礦山 全年無休 你可以想像當時在一萬英尺高採礦的情景"}, {"zh-tw": " You may recognize a couple of the miners there. There's Jeff Bezos on the right and Paul Saville on the left looking for galena, which is the lead-silver thing. They didn't find any.", "en": " 你們或許會認出一些礦工 站在右邊的是傑夫貝佐斯，左邊的是保羅薩維爾，他們正在找方鉛礦 但是沒有找到"}, {"zh-tw": " They both kept their day jobs. Here's the last mine. It's called the Bonanza Adit. It's down in a canyon.", "en": " 他們本身都有早上的工作，這是最後一個礦井 叫作- 豐收平坑，就在峽谷底"}, {"zh-tw": " And Alexander Rose on the left there worked with a bunch of people from the National Park to survey the whole mine. It's a mile deep. And they also found four species of bats in there.", "en": " 站在左邊的亞歷山大羅斯，和一些來自這國家公園的人 一起探勘這整個礦井，有一英里深 他們還在裡面找到了四種不同種類的蝙蝠"}, {"zh-tw": " Now, almost all those mines, by the way, meet underneath the mountain. They don't quite, but it's something to think about.", "en": " 幾乎所有的礦井在山的下面都是互通的 並不是很相通，但是滿值的思考的"}, {"zh-tw": " They don't quite meet. Let's go to weather. Mountains specialize in interesting weather.", "en": " 並不是很相通 再來是-天氣，山上的天氣特別有趣"}, {"zh-tw": " Way more interesting than Monterey even today. And so one Tuesday morning last June, there we were.", "en": " 甚至比現在的蒙特雷有趣 所以在去年六月的一個星期二　，我們在那"}, {"zh-tw": " Woke up in the morning -- the mountain was covered with snow. That was a great time to go up and visit our weather station which again, thanks to Mitch Kapor, we're building up there.", "en": " 一早起來，整坐山蓋滿了雪 那是去我們的氣候站非常好的時間 再一次感謝米奇·凱普，我們能在那建立氣象站"}, {"zh-tw": " And it's a pretty interesting scene. This is, on the left there, the joyful lady is Pat Irwin, who's the regional head of the National Forest Service, and they gave us the temporary use permit to be there.", "en": " 這是一幅不錯的景像 站在左邊非常開懐的女士- 帕特歐文 他是這國家森林服務區的區域主管 她給了我們在那的短期的使用權"}, {"zh-tw": " We want a temporary use permit for the clock, eventually -- 10,000-year temporary use permit. The weather station's pretty interesting.", "en": " 但最終我們要可以放置萬年鐘的許可 一萬年的”短期”使用權 這個氣象站非常有趣"}, {"zh-tw": " Kurt Bollacker and Alexander Rose designed a radically wireless station. It runs on solar, and it sends a signalwith that antenna and bounces it off of micrometeorite trails in the atmosphere to a place in Bozeman, Montana, where the data is taken down and then sent through landlines to San Francisco, where we put the data in real time up on our website.", "en": " 庫爾特伯拉克和亞歷山大羅斯設計了一個全新的無線氣象站 它是由太陽供電，然後再由這個天線發射訊號出去 撞到大氣層裡的微流星體再反射回來 到蒙大拿州的波茲曼接收資料 再透過線路送到舊金山 我們可以同步的把資料上傳到網站上"}, {"zh-tw": " And there you see a week of weather at 9,400 feet on Mount Washington. Let's go to approaches.", "en": " 在這你可以看到9400英尺高的華盛頓山脈上一周的天氣 接下來聊- 進去的途境"}, {"zh-tw": " As it happens, there are no trails anywhere on Mount Washington, just a few old mining roads like this, so you have to bushwhack everywhere.
