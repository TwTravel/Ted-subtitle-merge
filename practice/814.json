So let's watch a movement happen,start to finish, in under three minutes and dissect some lessons from it.", "en": " 各位先生女士們，在TED大會中 我們談了許多關於領導力，和如何發起群眾運動的議題 那麼讓我們來看一場群眾運動的誕生，從開始到結束，還不到三分鐘 並從當中學到一些經驗"}, {"zh-tw": " First, of course you know, a leader needs the gutsto stand out and be ridiculed. What he's doing is so easy to follow.", "en": " 當然，首先，做為一個領導者需要膽識 他要站出來並接受嘲笑 不過他所做的很容易跟著做"}, {"zh-tw": " Here's his first followerwith a crucial role; he's going to show everyoneelse how to follow. Now, notice that the leaderembraces him as an equal.", "en": " 這裡出現第一個關鍵的跟隨者角色 他要讓大家看到如何跟上 現在，你觀察到這位領導者以平等的態度接納他"}, {"zh-tw": " Now it's not about the leader anymore; it's about them, plural. Now, there he is calling to his friends.", "en": " 所以，現在領導者是誰已不重要 而是屬於\"他們\"的活動 接著，他號召他的朋友來參與"}, {"zh-tw": " Now, if you notice that the first follower is actually an underestimated formof leadership in itself. It takes guts to stand out like that.", "en": " 現在如果你注意到第一個跟隨者 其實他本身就是一個被低估的領導者角色 光是跟著站出來也需要膽識"}, {"zh-tw": " The first follower is what transformsa lone nut into a leader. And here comes a second follower.", "en": " 第一個跟隨者 把一個瘋子變成了領袖 接著第二個跟隨者出現"}, {"zh-tw": " Now it's not a lone nut,it's not two nuts -- three is a crowd, and a crowd is news. So a movement must be public.", "en": " 現在不是一個瘋子,也不是兩個瘋子 三人成為群體,而群體就是個話題 因此群眾運動必須是公眾的"}, {"zh-tw": " It's important to shownot just the leader, but the followers, because you find that new followersemulate the followers, not the leader. Now, here come two more people,and immediately after, three more people.", "en": " 重點是，不能只聚焦領導者,跟隨者也很重要 因為你會發現這些新的跟隨者 是模仿追隨者，而不是領導者 現在又來了兩個人,之後很快 又多了三個人"}, {"zh-tw": " Now we've got momentum.This is the tipping point. Now we've got a movement.", "en": " 這下子可熱鬧了，這是個引爆點 群眾運動誕生了"}, {"zh-tw": " So, notice that, as more people join in, it's less risky. So those that were sittingon the fence before now have no reason not to.", "en": " 所以請注意，隨著越多人加入 風險就越低 那些之前在旁袖手旁觀的人群沒理由不跟上了"}, {"zh-tw": " They won't stand out,they won't be ridiculed, but they will be partof the in-crowd if they hurry. So, over the next minute, you'll see all of those that preferto stick with the crowd because eventually they would beridiculed for not joining in.", "en": " 他們不站出來 也不會被嘲笑 但若快點行動,他們可以成為群體中的一份子 所以接下來的一分鐘 你會發現這些人寧願跟著群體走 因為最後會被嘲笑的 是沒加入的人"}, {"zh-tw": " And that's how you make a movement. But let's recap some lessons from this.", "en": " 這就是群眾運動的形成 不過，再重點複習一次"}, {"zh-tw": " So first, if you are the type, like the shirtless dancing guythat is standing alone, remember the importance of nurturingyour first few followers as equals so it's clearlyabout the movement, not you. Okay, but we might have missedthe real lesson here.", "en": " 第一,如果你的類型 是像那個打赤膊的跳舞男 記得重視你的跟隨者 並一視同仁 群眾運動不是領導者唱獨角戲 好吧,不過我們可能錯過了真正要學的"}, {"zh-tw": " The biggest lesson, if you noticed -- did you catch it? -- is that leadership is over-glorified. Yes, it was the shirtless guywho was first, and he'll get all the credit, but it was really the first follower that transformed the lone nutinto a leader.", "en": " 最大的功課是,如果你有注意到 你會發現,領導者的地位 被過度美化了 沒錯,打赤膊的男子率先行動 目光都在他身上 但其實是第一個跟隨者 把一個瘋子變成領袖"}, {"zh-tw": " So, as we're toldthat we should all be leaders, that would be really ineffective. If you really careabout starting a movement, have the courage to followand show others how to follow.", "en": " 因此雖然我們都被教導要成為領袖 實際上這樣是行不通的 若你認真要喚起一個群眾運動 拿出勇氣跟上領導者 並向他人展現如何跟隨"}, {"zh-tw": " And when you find a lone nutdoing something great, have the guts to be the first oneto stand up and join in. And what a perfect placeto do that, at TED.", "en": " 當你發現一個瘋子在做很棒的事 拿出膽識,第一個跟上 站出來加入他 要這麼做,參與TED大會就是最好的示範"}, {"zh-tw": " Thanks.", "en": " 謝謝"}], "title": "Derek Sivers How To Start A Movement"}
