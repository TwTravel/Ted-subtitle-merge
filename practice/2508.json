I mean, it's a personwho sort of missed fitting in.", "en": " 這個詞叫作「異類」。 這是我最喜愛的詞，因為它是如此地切和字面上的意思—— 我的意思是，那意味著，一個人錯過了融入群體的機會。"}, {"zh-tw": " Or a person who fits in badly. Or this: \"a person who is poorly adapted to new situations and environments.\" I'm a card-carrying misfit.", "en": " 或是指一個人融入得非常糟糕。 或該這麼說：無法良好適應 新的處境與環境的一個人。 我就是一個不折不扣的「異類」。"}, {"zh-tw": " And I'm here for the othermisfits in the room, because I'm never the only one. I'm going to tell you a misfit story.", "en": " 而為了其他異類，我站在這裡， 因為在異類中，我永遠不是唯一一個。 我現在要和你們說一個異類的故事。"}, {"zh-tw": " Somewhere in my early 30s, the dream of becoming a writercame right to my doorstep. Actually, it came to my mailbox in the form of a letter that saidI'd won a giant literary prize for a short story I had written.", "en": " 當我三十出頭時， 成為一位作家的夢想近得彷彿就在我眼前。 實際上，它來到了我的郵箱中， 一封信件表示我獲得了一個知名文學獎項。 得獎的是我寫的一篇短篇故事。"}, {"zh-tw": " The short story was about my lifeas a competitive swimmer and about my crappy home life, and a little bit about how griefand loss can make you insane. The prize was a trip to New York Cityto meet big-time editors and agents and other authors.", "en": " 短篇故事的內容是關於我作為優秀游泳選手的生活， 還有我糟透了的家庭生活。 另外還有那些關於傷痛和失去是如何逼瘋人的。 獲獎的獎勵是一趟旅程：前往紐約會見一流的編輯，著作經紀人 以及其他的作家。"}, {"zh-tw": " So kind of it was the wannabewriter's dream, right? You know what I did the daythe letter came to my house? Because I'm me, I put the letter on my kitchen table, I poured myself a giant glass of vodka with ice and lime, and I sat there in my underwearfor an entire day, just staring at the letter. I was thinking about all the waysI'd already screwed my life up.", "en": " 這就是一個立志成為作家的人的夢想，對吧？ 但你知道我在拿到信的那天做了什麼嗎？ 因為我就是我， 我把信件放在廚房的桌上， 喝了一大杯伏特加， 加了冰塊和萊姆片， 我穿著內衣坐在那裡一整天， 只是盯著信看。 我在想我一路是如何把自己的人生搞砸的。"}, {"zh-tw": " Who the hell was I to go to New York City and pretend to be a writer? Who was I? I'll tell you. I was a misfit.", "en": " 該死的那個要前往紐約、 裝作是一名作家的我到底是誰？ 我是誰？ 我來告訴你。 我是個異類。"}, {"zh-tw": " Like legions of other children, I came from an abusive household that I narrowly escaped with my life.

And I'd done an episodeof rehab for drug use.", "en": " 我被大學退學不只一次，而是兩次。 或許還有第三次，但我不打算告訴你們。 我經歷過一次戒毒療程。"}, {"zh-tw": " And I'd had two lovelystaycations in jail. So I'm on the right stage.", "en": " 我有兩段美好的居家休假——在監獄裡。 我很適合這個舞台不是嗎。"}, {"zh-tw": " But the real reason,I think, I was a misfit, is that my daughter diedthe day she was born, and I hadn't figured outhow to live with that story yet. After my daughter diedI also spent a long time homeless, living under an overpass in a kind of profound stateof zombie grief and loss that some of us encounter along the way.", "en": " 但真正的理由，我想，是因為我是個不適應環境的人。 我女兒在她出生當天去世， 而我還不知道要如何面對這件事。 在我女兒去世後，我有很長一段時間無家可歸， 住在天橋下， 沉溺在一種行屍走肉般的悲痛和失去所有的沉重情緒中， 那是我們部分人會經歷的過程。"}, {"zh-tw": " Maybe all of us, if you live long enough. You know, homeless peopleare some of our most heroic misfits, because they start out as us.", "en": " 也許我們所有人都會經歷——如果你活得夠長。 你知道，無家可歸者是最英勇的異類， 因為他們和我們有著一樣的開始。"}, {"zh-tw": " So you see, I'd missed fitting into just about every category out there: daughter, wife, mother, scholar.

And you got to meet a bunchof editors and authors and agents at very, very fancy lunches and dinners.", "en": " 而你也要裝作自己很酷炫、聰明、愛出風頭。 接著，你要去會見許多編輯、作家與著作經紀人， 在非常、非常豪華別緻的午餐和晚餐廳中。"}, {"zh-tw": " Ask me how fancy.

Lynne Tillman gave mepermission to believe that there was a chancemy stories could be part of the world.", "en": " 卡羅爾．馬索寫的書成為了我心目中的藝術聖經。 琳恩．提爾曼讓我相信 我的故事有機會成為這個世界的一部分。"}, {"zh-tw": " And Peggy Phelan reminded me that maybe my brainscould be more important than my boobs. They weren't mainstream women writers, but they were cutting a paththrough the mainstream with their body stories, I like to think, kind of the waywater cut the Grand Canyon.", "en": " 而佩姬．菲蘭提醒我 或許我的大腦比我的胸部更重要。 她們不是主流女性作家， 但是她們用自身故事 從主流裡另闢蹊徑。 我喜歡思考，想要知道流水是如何切出大峽谷的。"}, {"zh-tw": " It nearly killed me with joy to hang out with these threeover-50-year-old women writers. And the reason it nearlykilled me with joy is that I'd never known a joy like that.", "en": " 和這三名超過五十歲的女作家相談—— 這種喜悅感幾乎讓我無法自拔。 而讓我無法自拔的原因是 我從不知道有這樣一種喜悅。"}, {"zh-tw": " I'd never been in a room like that. My mother never went to college.", "en": " 我從沒有待在這樣一種房間。 我母親沒有上過大學。"}, {"zh-tw": " And my creative career to that point was a sort of small, sad, stillborn thing. So kind of in those first nightsin New York I wanted to die there.", "en": " 從這一點上來說，我的創作生涯， 只是個渺小、卑微、胎死腹中的東西。 所以我幾乎想要死在紐約，因為那些充滿初體驗的美好夜晚。"}, {"zh-tw": " I was just like, \"Kill me now.I'm good. This is beautiful.\" Some of you in the roomwill understand what happened next. First, they took me to the officesof Farrar, Straus and Giroux.", "en": " 就像是「殺了我吧，太好了，這實在是太美好了。」 你們一部分人會理解接下來發生的事。 首先，他們把我帶到法勒、斯特勞斯和吉魯的辦公室。"}, {"zh-tw": " Farrar, Straus and Girouxwas like my mega-dream press.

You know, like a memoir.", "en": " 那裡的主編請我坐下並和我談了許久。 他試圖說服我寫一本書， 有關身為游泳選手的我的人生。 你知道，就像本回憶錄。"}, {"zh-tw": " The whole time he was talking to me, I sat there smiling and noddinglike a numb idiot, with my arms crossed over my chest, while nothing, nothing, nothingcame out of my throat. So in the end, he patted meon the shoulder like a swim coach might.", "en": " 他對我說話的過程中， 我坐在那，雙手環抱胸前， 不停傻笑、點頭像個傻瓜。 然而我並沒有開口說出任何任何一個字。 所以到了最後，他拍了拍我的肩膀， 就像個游泳教練一樣，"}, {"zh-tw": " And he wished me luck and he gave me some free books and he showed me out the door.

Norton, where I was pretty sureI'd be escorted from the building just for wearing Doc Martens.", "en": " 他祝我好運。 然後他給了我一些免費的書籍， 指引我從何離開。 接著，他們將我帶到W.W.諾頓的辦公室， 我相當肯定，龐克打扮的我， 會有人一起陪同前往。"}, {"zh-tw": " But that didn't happen. Being at the Norton offices felt like reaching up into the night skyand touching the moon while the stars stitched your nameacross the cosmos.", "en": " 然而這並沒有發生。 待在諾頓的辦公室裡， 感覺就像在夜空中伸手觸碰月亮的美好， 而宇宙中的星星正閃爍著編織我的名字。"}, {"zh-tw": " I mean, that's how biga deal it was to me. You get it? Their lead editor, Carol Houck Smith, leaned over right in my facewith these beady, bright, fierce eyes and said, \"Well, send mesomething then, immediately!\" See, now most people,especially TED people, would have run to the mailbox, right? It took me over a decade to even imagine putting something in an envelopeand licking a stamp.", "en": " 我的意思是，這對我來說是多麼了不起的一件事。 你能明白嗎？ 他們的主編，卡羅爾．霍克史密斯， 在我面前傾身，用明亮、熱烈、犀利的目光， 告訴我：「馬上把你的一些作品寄給我！」 看吧，大部分的人尤其是來到TED這裡的人 會馬上衝去郵箱，對吧？ 我簡直難以想像把一些我寫的東西 放入信封再舔一下郵票會是什麼樣子。"}, {"zh-tw": " On the last night, I gave a big readingat the National Poetry Club. And at the end of the reading, Katharine Kidde of Kidde,Hoyt & Picard Literary Agency, walked straight up to me and shook my hand and offered me representation,like, on the spot.", "en": " 在紐約的最後一晚， 我在全國詩歌社裡參加了一場讀書會。 讀書會結束時， 凱德出版社的凱瑟琳．凱德和霍伊特與皮卡德著作經紀人 徑直地走向我，與我握手， 並且當場提供給我代理權。"}, {"zh-tw": " I stood there and I kind of went deaf. Has this ever happened to you? And I almost started crying because all the people in the roomwere dressed so beautifully, and all that came out of my mouth was: \"I don't know. I have to think about it.\" And she said, \"OK, then,\" and walked away.", "en": " 我呆立著，突然聾了。 你們經歷過這種事嗎？ 我幾乎要哭出來了。 因為整個房間的人穿著都是如此華麗， 然後從我口中說出的卻是： 「我不知道，讓我考慮一下。」 然後她說了「當然。」便離開了。"}, {"zh-tw": " All those open hands out to me,that small, sad stone in my throat ...

It's a shame we carry.", "en": " 異類 － 我們不知道如何期待，甚至不會開口説一個「好」 也不知道去選擇那些「大好事」。 就算那些機會明擺在我們面前。 這是我們無法擺脫的一種恥辱。"}, {"zh-tw": " It's the shame of wanting something good. It's the shame of feeling something good.", "en": " 這是一種想得到美好的東西的恥辱。 這是一種感受到美好的東西的恥辱。"}, {"zh-tw": " It's the shame of not really believingwe deserve to be in the room with the people we admire.

Yeah, you!You belong in the room, too.\" The radiance falls on all of us, and we are nothing without each other.
