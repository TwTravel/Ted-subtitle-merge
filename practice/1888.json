I am an example of that. I was born in a little village called Gando.", "en": " 根據世界銀行，布吉納法索 名列全球最窮國之一， 但是在那種地方長大成人 是什麼樣子？ 我就是其中一例。 我出生在一個名叫甘多的小村莊。"}, {"zh-tw": " In Gando, there was no electricity, no access to clean drinking water, and no school. But my father wanted me to learn how to read and write.", "en": " 甘多沒有電力， 沒有乾淨的飲用水，沒有學校。 但是我的父親希望我 學習如何閱讀和寫字。"}, {"zh-tw": " For this reason, I had to leave my family when I was seven and to stay in a city far away from my village with no contact with my family. In this place I sat in a class like that with more than 150 other kids, and for six years.", "en": " 因為這個因素，我必須離開家人， 我七歲時待在都市， 遠離我的村子， 無法連絡家人。 我坐的這個地方 是一間教室， 裡面有超過 150 個小孩， 長達六年。"}, {"zh-tw": " In this time, it just happened to me to come to school to realize that my classmate died.

I just wanted to use my skills and build a school.", "en": " 但我要怎麼利用這個恩賜呢？ 從我還是個學生開始，我想幫助 其他甘多的孩子得到更好的機會。 我只想運用我的能力，蓋一所學校。"}, {"zh-tw": " But how do you do it when you're still a student and you don't have money?

So I had to convince everybody.", "en": " 這是他花這麼多時間 在歐洲唸書， 而不和我們在田裡工作的原因嗎？」 我的村民總是用泥土建造， 但是他們沒有在泥土上創新。 因此我得說服每個人。"}, {"zh-tw": " I started to speak with the community, and I could convince everybody, and we could start to work. And the women, the men, everybody from the village, was part of this building process.", "en": " 我開始找大家談， 說服每個人， 之後就可以開工。 不分男女， 每個村子裡的人 都參與建築的過程。"}, {"zh-tw": " I was allowed to use even traditional techniques.

They start polishing it with a stone for hours.", "en": " 接著負責磨光的村民又來。 他們開始用石頭磨光好幾個小時。"}, {"zh-tw": " And then you have this result, very fine, like a baby bottom. It's not photoshopped.", "en": " 最後你可以看到成品， 非常精細，就像嬰兒的屁股。 這可沒修過圖。"}, {"zh-tw": " This is the school, built with the community.

The first one is the school extension, of course.", "en": " 因此我可以做更多工程， 在此我想和各位分享的 只有其中三件。 第一件是擴建學校，當然。"}, {"zh-tw": " How do you explain drawings and engineering to people who are neither able to read nor write? I started to build a prototype like that. The innovation was to build a clay vault.", "en": " 你要怎麼解釋繪圖和工程 給連讀和寫都不懂的人聽？ 我開始做像這樣的模型。 創新的是蓋一個泥造拱頂。"}, {"zh-tw": " So then, I jumped on the top like that, with my team, and it works. The community is looking. It still works.", "en": " 之後，我在上面像這樣跳， 和我的團隊一起跳，拱頂能承受。 大家都在看，拱頂仍然能承受（我們的重量）。"}, {"zh-tw": " So we can build.

We made it.", "en": " 孩子們都很開心，他們都很喜歡。 大家都感到驕傲，我們做到了。"}, {"zh-tw": " And even animals, like these donkeys, love our buildings. The next project is the library in Gando.", "en": " 就連動物，像是這些驢子 也喜歡我們的房子。 第二個工程是甘多的圖書館。"}, {"zh-tw": " And see now, we tried to introduce different ideas in our buildings, but we often don't have so much material.

So we just bring them like you can see to the building site.", "en": " 我想用來做通風口。 因此，我們就把你可以看到的這些 帶到建築現場。"}, {"zh-tw": " we start cutting them, and then we place them on top of the roof before we pour the concrete, and you have this result. The openings are letting the hot air out and light in.", "en": " 我們開始切割， 接著我們在灌混凝土前， 把這些罐子放在屋頂上， 你可以看到成果。 這些通風口能排出熱空氣， 並且讓光線透進來。"}, {"zh-tw": " Very simple. My most recent project in Gando is a high school project.", "en": " 非常簡單。 我在甘多最新的工程 是蓋一所高中。"}, {"zh-tw": " I would like to share with you this. The innovation in this project is to cast mud like you cast concrete.", "en": " 我想和你們分享這件事。 這個工程的創新 是澆築泥土，就像澆築混凝土一樣。"}, {"zh-tw": " How do you cast mud? We start making a lot of mortars, like you can see, and when everything is ready, when you know what is the best recipe and the best form, you start working with the community. And sometimes I can leave.", "en": " 要怎麼澆築泥土呢？ 我們開始製做大量的砂漿，就像你看到的這個， 當每件事都準備就序， 當你知道什麼是最好的配料 和最好的組成， 就可以和大家一起開始工作。 有時候我可以離開，"}, {"zh-tw": " They will do it themselves. I came to speak to you like that.", "en": " 他們可以自己做， 就像我今天可以來這裡演講。"}, {"zh-tw": " Another factor in Gando is rain. When the rains come, we hurry up to protect our fragile walls against the rain.", "en": " 影響甘多的另一個要素是雨， 當雨來了， 我們要趕快保護脆弱的牆面， 以免被雨淋到。"}, {"zh-tw": " Don't confound with Christo and Jeanne-Claude. It is simply how we protect our walls.", "en": " 別和克里斯托和珍妮克勞德搞混。 我們保護牆壁的方法很簡單。"}, {"zh-tw": " The rain in Burkina comes very fast, and after that, you have floods everywhere in the country. But for us, the rain is good.", "en": " 布吉納法索的雨來得很急， 在那之後會淹水， 在鄉下到處都是。 但是對我們來說，下雨很好。"}, {"zh-tw": " It brings sand and gravel to the river we need to use to build. We just wait for the rain to go.", "en": " 雨會把沙子和砂礫帶到河裡， 我們需要運用它來建房子。 我們只要等雨下完，"}, {"zh-tw": " We take the sand, we mix it with clay, and we keep building. That is it.", "en": " 收集沙子，混合泥土， 就能繼續蓋房子。 就這麼簡單。"}, {"zh-tw": " The Gando project was alwaysconnected to training the people, because I just wanted, one day when I fall down and die, that at least one person from Gando keeps doing this work. But you will be surprised. I'm still alive.", "en": " 甘多的工程一向與訓練人們有關， 因為我只希望有一天 當我倒下、過世， 至少甘多還有一個人 可以繼續這項工作。 但是讓你驚訝的是，我還活著。"}, {"zh-tw": " And my people now can use their skills to earn money themselves. Usually, for a young man from Gando to earn money, you have to leave the country to the city, sometimes leave the country and some never come back, making the community weaker.", "en": " 我的同胞現在可以運用他們的能力 為自己賺錢。 通常，一個從甘多來的年輕人想要賺錢， 必須離鄉背井 到城市去，有時候離開鄉村的人 永遠不會回來， 讓整個社群變得更衰弱。"}, {"zh-tw": " But now they can stay in the country and work on different building sites and earn money to feed their family. There's a new quality in this work.", "en": " 但現在他們可以留在鄉村， 在不同的建地工作、 賺錢養家。 這份工作有新的品質。"}, {"zh-tw": " Yes, you know it. I have won a lot of awards through this work.", "en": " 沒錯，你知道的。 因為這項工作我得了很多獎。"}, {"zh-tw": " For sure, it has opened opportunities. I have become myself known.", "en": " 無疑的是它增加了許多機會。 我為自己帶來名聲，"}, {"zh-tw": " But the reason why I do what I do is my community. When I was a kid, I was going to school, I was coming back every holiday to Gando.", "en": " 但是我做這些事的原因 是為了我的家鄉。 當我還是個孩子時， 我上學的時候， 每個假日都會回甘多。"}, {"zh-tw": " By the end of every holidays, I had to say goodbye to the community, going from one compound to another one. All women in Gando will open their clothes like that and give me the last penny.", "en": " 在每次假期結束時， 我要跟所有家鄉的人說再見， 從一個聚落到另一個聚落。 所有在甘多的女人都會掀開他們的衣服，就像那樣， 然後給我最後一分錢。"}, {"zh-tw": " In my culture, this is a symbol of deep affection. As a seven-year-old guy, I was impressed.", "en": " 在我們的習俗中，這是很深的情感象徵。 當時我還是個七歲小孩，我非常感動。"}, {"zh-tw": " I just asked my mother one day, \"Why do all these women love me so much?\" She just answered, \"They are contributing to pay for your education hoping that you will be successful and one day come back and help improve the quality of life of the community.\" I hope now that I was ableto make my community proud through this work, and I hope I was able to prove you the power of community, and to show you that architecture can be inspiring for communities to shape their own future. Merci beaucoup.", "en": " 有天我問媽媽： 「為什麼這些女士這麼愛我？」 她只說了： 「他們想為你的教育盡一分心力， 希望你能成功， 有一天回來協助 大家改善生活品質。」 我希望能透過這項工作 讓大家感到榮耀， 我希望能向你證明 社群的力量， 讓你看到建築 可以激勵大家 塑造自己的未來。 非常感謝。"}, {"zh-tw": " Thank you. Thank you.
