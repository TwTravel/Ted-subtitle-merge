In fact, one guy emailed to say he thought his 15-year-old sonwas selling drugs and later found outhe was selling sneakers.", "en": " 所以這個不受規範、價值12億美元、 在街上和線上都一樣活躍的產業， 竟然還催生了專為球鞋打造的基礎財務服務？ 有一天，我曾自問這個市場究竟是怎麼回事， 有兩個東西的對比開始浮現。 球鞋比較像股票，還是毒品？ 事實上，曾有人寫信給我， 說他以為他15歲的兒子在販毒， 後來發現他原來是在賣鞋。"}, {"zh-tw": " And now they use the datato do it together. And that's because sneakersare an investment opportunity where none other exists.", "en": " 而現在他們利用數據一起在做這件事。 這是因為球鞋可以是種投資機會 而其他商品則不行。"}, {"zh-tw": " And I don't just mean the kidselling sneakers instead of drugs. How about all kids? You have to be 18to play the stock market.", "en": " 我想說的並不只是這個孩子用賣鞋取代販毒。 如果所有孩子都這麼做呢？ 你必須滿18歲才能玩股票。"}, {"zh-tw": " I sold chewing gum in sixth grade, Blow Pops in ninth grade and collected baseball cardsthrough high school.

Which is why the storyyou're probably most familiar with is people killing each other for sneakers.", "en": " 但對許多人來說，球鞋是個合法而容易進入的投資機會── 一個民主化的股票市場， 但也是未受規範的。 這也是為什麼你可能經常聽到 有人為了球鞋殺人這種事情。"}, {"zh-tw": " And while that definitelyhappens and is tragic, it's not nearly the epidemicsome media would have you believe. In fact, it's a very small pieceof a much bigger and better story.", "en": " 這是確實會發生的事，也絕對是悲劇， 卻不是某些媒體寫的那種流行病。 事實上，這只是更大更美好的故事中非常小的一部分。"}, {"zh-tw": " So sneakers have clear similarities to both the stock exchangeand the illegal drug trade, but perhaps the most fundamentalis the existence of a central actor. Someone is making the rules.", "en": " 所以球鞋買賣明顯相似於 股票交易和非法毒品交易， 但或許最重要的是有個核心演員存在。 有人訂出了這些規則。"}, {"zh-tw": " In the case of sneakers,that someone is Nike. Let me walk you through some numbers.", "en": " 在球鞋的案例中，這個人就是Nike。 讓我快速帶各位看過幾個數字。"}, {"zh-tw": " The resell market,we know, is $1.2 billion. Nike, including Jordan brand, accounts for 96 percent of all shoessold on the secondary market.", "en": " 我們知道轉賣市場價值12億美元。 Nike，包含Jordan牌， 在二手市場賣出了總雙數96%的鞋。"}, {"zh-tw": " Just complete domination. Sneakerheads love Jordans.", "en": " 完全的支配。 鞋頭們很愛Jordan鞋。"}, {"zh-tw": " And profit on the secondary marketis about a third. That means that sneakerheadsmade 380 million dollars selling Nikes last year.", "en": " 而二手市場的利潤大約是33%。 這代表這些鞋頭去年賺了3億8,000萬美金， 僅靠賣Nike球鞋。"}, {"zh-tw": " Let's jump to retail for a second. Skechers, earlier this year, became the number twofootwear brand in the country, surpassing Adidas --this was a big deal.", "en": " 讓我們暫時先跳到零售市場。 Skechers，今年稍早 成為美國第二大的鞋子品牌， 超越Adidas──這可是件大事。"}, {"zh-tw": " And in the 12 months ending in June, Skechers's net incomewas 209 million dollars. That means that Nike's customers make almost twice as much profitas their closest competitor.", "en": " 而在今年六月為止的12個月中， Skechers淨利為2億9百萬美元。 意思是Nike的顧客 賺了他們最大競爭者幾乎兩倍的錢。"}, {"zh-tw": " That -- How is that even possible? The sneaker marketis just supply and demand, but Nike's gotten very good at usingsupply -- limited sneakers -- and the distribution of those sneakersto their own benefit. So it's really just supply.", "en": " 這…… 這怎麼可能呢？ 球鞋市場就只是供給和需求而已， 但Nike非常善於操作供給──限量鞋款， 以及這些鞋款的銷售配額來增加他們的利益。 所以真的就只是控制供給。"}, {"zh-tw": " Sneakerheads joke that as longas it's limited and Nike, they'll buy it. Shoes that sell for 8,000 dollarsdo so because they're very rare.", "en": " 鞋頭常開玩笑地說，只要是Nike限量款，他們就會買。 鞋子可以賣8,000美元是因為它們很稀有。"}, {"zh-tw": " It's no different than any othercollectible market, only this isn't a market at all. It's a false construct created by Nike -- ingeniously created by Nike, in the mostpositive sense -- to sell more shoes.", "en": " 這點無異於任何其他收藏品的市場， 唯一不同的是，它根本不是個市場。 它是一個被Nike創造出來的假結構 － 在最積極的意義上，Nike巧妙地創造出來的──為了賣更多鞋。"}, {"zh-tw": " And in the process, it provided tens of thousands of peoplewith life-long passions, myself included. If Nike wanted to kill the resell market,they could do so tomorrow, all they have to do is release more shoes.", "en": " 而在過程中， 供應了數以萬計、擁有畢生熱情的人， 包含我自己在內。 如果Nike想摧毀這個轉售市場，他們明天就辦得到， 只要釋出更多的鞋就行了。"}, {"zh-tw": " But we certainly don't want them to,nor is it in their best interest. That's because unlike Apple, who will sellan iPhone to anyone who wants one, Nike doesn't make their moneyby just selling $200 sneakers.", "en": " 但我們肯定不希望他們這麼做，當然對他們自己也無益。 這是因為不像Apple將iPhone賣給任何想要的人， Nike不是光靠著賣200美元的球鞋賺錢。"}, {"zh-tw": " They sell millions of shoes to millionsof people for 60 dollars. And sneakerheads are the oneswho drive the marketing and the hype and the PRand the brand cachet, and enable Nike to sell millionsof $60 sneakers.", "en": " 他們將幾百萬雙60美元的鞋賣給幾百萬個人。 而鞋頭就是幫他們促進行銷成效、 炒作、公共關係、品牌印記的人， 讓Nike可以把60美元的鞋賣給上百萬人。"}, {"zh-tw": " It's marketing. It's marketing the likes of whichhas never been seen before -- this isn't in any textbook.", "en": " 這是行銷。 這是前所未見的行銷手法， 沒有在任何教科書上。"}, {"zh-tw": " For 15 years Nike has propped upan artificial commodities market, with a Facebook-level hyped IPOevery single weekend. Drive by any Footlocker at 8amon a Saturday morning, and there will be a line down the streetand around the block, and sometimes those kidshave been waiting there all week.", "en": " 15年來，Nike扶植了一個人工商品市場， 每個週末都搞一次炒作程度如同Facebook的首次公開募資。 星期六早上八點開車經過任何Footlocker店面， 街上會有一條長長的隊伍圍繞整個街區， 有些孩子甚至等了一整個禮拜。"}, {"zh-tw": " You know those crazy iPhone linesyou see on the news every other year? Nike lines happen 104 times more often. So Nike sets the rules.", "en": " 你看過iPhone每年推出新機時瘋狂排隊盛況嗎？ Nike排隊盛況的頻率是那個的104倍。 所以是Nike制定了遊戲規則。"}, {"zh-tw": " And they do so by controllingsupply and distribution. But once a pair leavesthe retail channel, it's the Wild West.", "en": " 方法是控制供給和銷售配額。 而當這些鞋離開零售店，就是狂野的大西部了。"}, {"zh-tw": " There are very few -- if any --legal, unregulated markets of this size. So Nike is definitelynot the stock exchange.", "en": " 如此規模的合法卻又未受規範的市場極罕見，可說是除此之外根本沒有， 所以Nike球鞋肯定不是股票交易。"}, {"zh-tw": " In fact, there is no central exchange. By last count, there were 48 differentonline markets that I know of.", "en": " 事實上，連交易中心都沒有。 上次計算時，光我所知就有48個不同的線上市場。"}, {"zh-tw": " Some are eBay clones,some are mobile markets, and then you have consignment shopsand brick-and-mortar stores, and sneaker conventions,and reseller sites, and Facebook and Instagram and Twitter -- literally, anywhere sneakerheadscome into contact with each other, shoes will be bought and sold. But that means no efficiencies,no transparency, sometimes not even authenticity.", "en": " 有些是eBay的複製品、有些是行動市場， 還有寄售商店、實體店面， 還有球鞋交易中心、二手轉賣網站， 還有Facebook、Instagram、Twitter…… 真的是鞋頭可以接觸彼此的任何地方， 就會有球鞋買賣。 但這表示沒有效率、也不透明， 有時甚至沒有誠信。"}, {"zh-tw": " Can you imagine if that'show stocks were bought? What if the way to buya share of Apple stock was to search over 100 placesonline and off, including every timeyou walk down the street just hoping to pass someonewearing some Apple stock? Never knowing who had the best price, or even if the stockyou were looking at was real. That would surely make you say: [WTF?] Of course that's not how we buy stock.", "en": " 你能想像如果股票被這樣買賣嗎？ 如果你要買一股Apple的股票， 得先搜尋超過100個線上或實體商店， 包含每次走在街上時 都期待撞見一個穿著Apple股票的人，一切會變怎樣？ 永遠不知道誰會有最好的價格， 甚至不知道你看到的這張股票是不是真的。 這肯定會讓你想說： （這什麼鬼東西啊！？） 這當然不是我們購買股票的方式。"}, {"zh-tw": " But what if that's not howwe need to buy sneakers either? What if the inverse is true, and what if we could buy sneakers exactly the same way as we buy stock? And what if it wasn't just sneakers,but any similar product, like watches and handbagsand women's shoes, and any collectible, any seasonal itemand any markdown item? What if there wasa stock market for commerce? A stock market of things. And not only could you buy in a much moreeducated and efficient manner, but you could engage in allthe sophisticated financial transactions you can with the stock market.", "en": " 但如果這也不是我們必須購買球鞋的方式呢？ 如果情況相反過來， 如果我們可以用和買股票完全相同的方式來購買球鞋呢？ 如果不只是球鞋，還有任何類似商品， 像是手錶、手提包、女鞋， 以及任何收藏品、當季品項和特價商品呢？ 如果商品界也有股票市場呢？ 實體物品的股票市場。 這樣你不只可以用更有知識根據、更有效率的方式買東西， 還可以操作所有完善的財務交易， 就像操作股票一樣。"}, {"zh-tw": " Shorts and options and futures and well, maybe you seewhere this is going. Maybe you want to investin a stock market of things.", "en": " 空頭交易、選擇權、期貨， 或許你了解它會怎麼發展。 或許你也想買一些實體商品的股票。"}, {"zh-tw": " Because if you had invested in a pairof Air Jordan 3 Black Cement in 2011, you could either be wearing them onstage, or have earned 162 percenton your money -- double the S&P and 20 percentmore than Apple.
