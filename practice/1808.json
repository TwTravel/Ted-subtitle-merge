In fact, the first time, Derek, you played that with an orchestra, you'd learned the version that you'd learned, and then the orchestra, in fact, did have a different version, so while we were waiting in the two hours before the rehearsal and the concert, Derek listened to the different version and learned it quickly and then was able to play it with the orchestra.", "en": " 多數鋼琴家可能會心臟病發如果你說 \"不好意思 可以請你彈'大黃蜂的飛行' 但不要用A小調 而是用B小調?\" 事實上 德雷克你第一次與交響樂團一起演奏時 你就學到你已經學過的那種版本了 事實上 之後交響樂團有另一個不同的版本 在我們等了兩個小時的同時 在預演與演奏會開始之前 德雷克聽到不同的版本也很快就學會了 隨後就能馬上與交響樂團一起演奏"}, {"zh-tw": " Fantastic chap.
