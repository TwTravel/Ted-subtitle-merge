It's an important part of my life.", "en": " 我叫丹‧柯恩，像剛剛那人說的，我是個學者 這也就意味著我經常辯論 辯論是我人生重要的一部分，我喜歡辯論"}, {"zh-tw": " And I like to argue. And I'm not just an academic,I'm a philosopher, so I like to think that I'm actuallypretty good at arguing.", "en": " 我不只是個學者，我也是個哲學家 我常常覺得，我應該很擅長辯論"}, {"zh-tw": " But I also like to thinka lot about arguing. And in thinking about arguing,I've come across some puzzles.", "en": " 我也喜歡思考辯論 在這過程中，我遇到了一些困惑"}, {"zh-tw": " And one of the puzzles is that, as I've been thinkingabout arguing over the years -- and it's been decades now -- I've gotten better at arguing. But the more that I argueand the better I get at arguing, the more that I lose.", "en": " 其中有個是 過去這幾年，我一直思考辯論 到現在已經幾十年了我也是越來越擅長辯論了 但我辯論得越多，辯論得越好"}, {"zh-tw": " And that's a puzzle. And the other puzzleis that I'm actually okay with that.", "en": " 我也就輸得越多，這是我的困惑 另一個困惑是，我覺得這無所謂"}, {"zh-tw": " Why is it that I'm okay with losing and why is it that I think good arguersare actually better at losing? Well, there are some other puzzles. One is: why do we argue? Who benefits from arguments? When I think about arguments,I'm talking about -- let's call them academic argumentsor cognitive arguments -- where something cognitive is at stake: Is this proposition true?Is this theory a good theory? Is this a viable interpretationof the data or the text? And so on.", "en": " 為什麼我覺得輸會無所謂 為什麼我又覺得，好的辯論者 應該是更好的輸家？ 嗯……還有其他一些困惑 其中一個是，我們為何辯論？辯論使誰獲益？ 我現在思考辯論時所指的 就把它們稱為學術辯論或認知辯論 涉及認知利害關係的 這項提議是對的嗎？這是好的理論嗎？ 如此解釋這項數據或文本，是可行的嗎？"}, {"zh-tw": " I'm not interested really in argumentsabout whose turn it is to do the dishes or who has to take out the garbage. Yeah, we have those arguments, too.", "en": " 諸如此類。我對於辯論某些事情就沒什麼興趣 像是誰要去洗碗、誰要去倒垃圾 雖然我們也會辯論那些事情"}, {"zh-tw": " I tend to win those arguments,because I know the tricks. But those aren't the important arguments.", "en": " 這些辯論我滿常贏的，因為我知道技巧 但這些不是很重要的辯論 我的興趣在於現今的學術辯論"}, {"zh-tw": " I'm interested in academic arguments, and here are the things that puzzle me. First, what do good arguers winwhen they win an argument? What do I win if I convince you that utilitarianism isn't reallythe right framework for thinking about ethical theories? What do we win when we win an argument? Even before that, what does it matter to me whether you have this ideathat Kant's theory works or Mill is the right ethicist to follow? It's no skin off my back whether you think functionalismis a viable theory of mind.", "en": " 下面這些事情給我帶了不少困惑 第一，辯論高手們贏得辯論時到底贏得了什麼？ 如果我說服你功利主義並不是 思考道德理論的正確方向，我獲得了什麼？ 所以當我們贏得辯論時，我們到底贏了什麼？ 甚至在辯論之前，無論你是支持康德或是密爾 覺得誰才是對的道德主義者 又和我有什麼關係？ 無論你認為功能主義是否為可行的心智理論 也是和我沒關係"}, {"zh-tw": " So why do we even try to argue? Why do we try to convince other people to believe thingsthey don't want to believe, and is that even a nice thing to do? Is that a nice way to treatanother human being, try and make them think somethingthey don't want to think? Well, my answer is going to make referenceto three models for arguments. The first model -- let's call itthe dialectical model -- is we think of arguments as war;you know what that's like -- a lot of screaming and shoutingand winning and losing.", "en": " 那我們到底為什麼要辯論？ 為什麼我們要去說服他人 去相信他們不願相信的事物 這麼做真的好嗎？ 這真的是一種對待他人的好方法嗎？ 設法讓他們相信他們不願相信的事物？ 我的答案將會談到 三種辯論模式 第一，我們就叫它為對話模式 這種模式，雙方把辯論看成戰爭，情況可想而知 雙方會吵鬧，大叫 也會有輸贏"}, {"zh-tw": " That's not a very helpfulmodel for arguing, but it's a pretty commonand entrenched model for arguing. But there's a second model for arguing:arguments as proofs.", "en": " 就辯論而言，這真的不是個有幫助的模式 但這種模式卻是很常見，也很強硬的一種模式 還有第二種模式，論證式辯論"}, {"zh-tw": " Think of a mathematician's argument. Here's my argument.Does it work? Is it any good? Are the premises warranted?Are the inferences valid? Does the conclusion followfrom the premises? No opposition, no adversariality -- not necessarily any arguingin the adversarial sense.", "en": " 想想一個數學家的辯論 這是我的論點，講得通嗎？有道理嗎？ 假設可靠嗎？參考數據可信嗎？ 結論是否與假設呼應？ 沒有反對，沒有對手 不一定有持反對意見的辯論"}, {"zh-tw": " But there's a third model to keep in mind that I think is going to be very helpful, and that is arguments as performances,arguments in front of an audience. We can think of a politiciantrying to present a position, trying to convincethe audience of something.", "en": " 還有第三種模式要注意 我覺得這是很有幫助的一種 就是做為表演的辯論 在一群觀眾面前辯論 想像一個政治人物，試著表明他的立場 要說服觀眾相信某件事情"}, {"zh-tw": " But there's another twist on this modelthat I really think is important; namely, that when we arguebefore an audience, sometimes the audience hasa more participatory role in the argument; that is, arguments are also[performances] in front of juries, who make a judgment and decide the case. Let's call this the rhetorical model, where you have to tailor your argumentto the audience at hand.", "en": " 這個模式中，還有個小轉折我覺得很重要 換言之，當我們在觀眾前辯論時 觀眾在此過程中擔任更有參與性角色 在觀眾前辯論，也就是在陪審團前辯論 他們下判決，決定案情結果 我們稱之為修辭模式 因為你要修改論點去迎合現場觀眾"}, {"zh-tw": " You know, presenting a sound, well-argued, tight argument in Englishbefore a francophone audience just isn't going to work. So we have these models --argument as war, argument as proof and argument as performance.", "en": " 比如在說法語的觀眾面前 發表一個有力的論點 是沒有用的 所以我們有三種模式分別為－戰爭式辯論 論證式辯論和表演性辯論"}, {"zh-tw": " Of those three, the argument as waris the dominant one. It dominates how we talk about arguments, it dominates how we think about arguments, and because of that,it shapes how we argue, our actual conduct in arguments.", "en": " 這三者中，戰爭式辯論一直都是比較強勢的 它影響著我們談論辯論的方式 影響著我們思考辯論的方式 因為如此，它也塑造我們辯論的方式 我們在辯論中的言行舉止"}, {"zh-tw": " Now, when we talk about arguments, we talk in a very militaristic language. We want strong arguments,arguments that have a lot of punch, arguments that are right on target.", "en": " 現在，當我們談及辯論 我們都用很強烈的語氣 我們想要站得住腳的論點，有力反擊的論點 正中要害的論點"}, {"zh-tw": " We want to have our defenses upand our strategies all in order. We want killer arguments.", "en": " 我們想要加強防守，穩固進攻策略 我們想要場殺手級的論點"}, {"zh-tw": " That's the kind of argument we want. It is the dominant wayof thinking about arguments.", "en": " 這就是我們所想要的 這是看待辯論的主流方式"}, {"zh-tw": " When I'm talking about arguments, that's probably what you thought of,the adversarial model. But the war metaphor, the war paradigm or modelfor thinking about arguments, has, I think, deforming effectson how we argue.", "en": " 當我和別人談起辯論時 你大概都會想到這種辯論 但是，這種戰爭比喻 這種戰爭式思考方式 就我認為，扭曲了我們的辯論效果"}, {"zh-tw": " First, it elevates tactics over substance. You can take a classin logic, argumentation.", "en": " 首先，戰爭辯論注重策略而非主旨 你可以修一堂邏輯課、辯論課"}, {"zh-tw": " You learn all about the subterfuges that people use to try and winarguments -- the false steps. It magnifies the us-versusthem aspect of it.", "en": " 你會學到所有人們用來贏得辯論的技巧 避免出現錯誤 這加強了他我敵對的意味"}, {"zh-tw": " It makes it adversarial; it's polarizing. And the only foreseeable outcomesare triumph -- glorious triumph -- or abject, ignominious defeat.", "en": " 讓雙方關係成為敵我關係，產生極端 而唯一能預見的結果 就是輝煌的勝利或是可恥的失敗"}, {"zh-tw": " I think those are deforming effects, and worst of all, it seemsto prevent things like negotiation or deliberation or compromiseor collaboration. Think about that one -- have youever entered an argument thinking, \"Let's see if we can hash something out,rather than fight it out.", "en": " 這些是扭曲的結果，最糟的是 這讓協商、審議以及妥協 這類情況不會發生 甚至都無法合作 試想一下，你有沒有參與過一場辯論 心中想著「讓我們看看有沒有辦法好好討論一下」"}, {"zh-tw": " What can we work out together?\" I think the argument-as-war metaphor inhibits those other kindsof resolutions to argumentation. And finally -- this is reallythe worst thing -- arguments don't seem to get usanywhere; they're dead ends.", "en": " 「而不是想著辯倒對方。」 我認為戰爭辯論所代表的是 它遏止了解決問題的其他方法 最後，這是最糟的情況 辯論最後沒有帶給我們任何東西"}, {"zh-tw": " They are like roundabouts or traffic jamsor gridlock in conversation. We don't get anywhere.", "en": " 像死胡同，原地打轉一樣 像塞車，談話遇到僵局一樣 我們什麼都沒得到"}, {"zh-tw": " And one more thing. And as an educator, this is the onethat really bothers me: If argument is war, then there's an implicit equationof learning with losing.", "en": " 身為一個教育家，還有一件事情 真正困擾我的事情是： 如果辯論就是戰爭，也就不會有 輸了辯論，學了東西這種事情"}, {"zh-tw": " And let me explain what I mean. Suppose you and I have an argument.", "en": " 我再解釋一下我的意思 假設你和我在辯論"}, {"zh-tw": " You believe a proposition, P, and I don't. And I say, \"Well, why do you believe P?\" And you give me your reasons.", "en": " 你支持 P 提案，我不支持 我問「為什麼你支持 P 提案？」 然後你告訴我你支持的理由"}, {"zh-tw": " And I object and say,\"Well, what about ...?\" And you answer my objection. And I have a question:\"Well, what do you mean? How does it apply over here?\" And you answer my question.", "en": " 我反問「那為什麼....？」 然後你對我的辯解做出回應 我又問你「那你說的是什麼意思呢？」 「這怎麼用在這裡呢？」你仍舊回答我的問題"}, {"zh-tw": " Now, suppose at the end of the day, I've objected, I've questioned, I've raised all sorts of countercounter-considerations and in every case you've respondedto my satisfaction. And so at the end of the day, I say, \"You know what? I guess you're right: P.\" So, I have a new belief.", "en": " 假設到了最後 我反對過了，我提問過了 我提出了所有的反向思考 而你對我的任何提問都給出了滿意的答案 最後我會說 我說「你知道嗎？我想你是對的。」 然後我相信了一個新理論，不是什麽隨便的理論"}, {"zh-tw": " And it's not just any belief; it's well-articulated, examined --it's a battle-tested belief. Great cognitive gain.", "en": " 是一個條理分明，經過仔細推敲 經得起考驗的理論"}, {"zh-tw": " OK, who won that argument? Well, the war metaphorseems to force us into saying you won, even though I'm the only onewho made any cognitive gain. What did you gain, cognitively,from convincing me? Sure, you got some pleasure out of it,maybe your ego stroked, maybe you get some professional status in the field --\"This guy's a good arguer.\" But just from a cognitive point of view, who was the winner? The war metaphor forces us into thinkingthat you're the winner and I lost, even though I gained.", "en": " 認知方面又多了新知，那到底誰贏了辯論？ 所以，戰爭辯論的言下之意是告訴我們 雖然你贏了，但我是唯一有獲得新知的人 從你說服我的過程中，你得到了什麼嗎？ 當然，你獲得快樂，你的自尊心可能更強烈 在那領域你可能又多了點學術地位 這傢伙很擅長辯論 但是，就從認知角度而言，誰是贏家？ 戰爭辯論的比喻使得我們認為 你是贏家，我是輸家 儘管我有學到東西"}, {"zh-tw": " And there's something wrongwith that picture. And that's the pictureI really want to change if we can.", "en": " 但是這樣不對 如果我們有辦法，這正是我想改變的"}, {"zh-tw": " So, how can we find ways to make argumentsyield something positive? What we need is newexit strategies for arguments. But we're not going to havenew exit strategies for arguments until we have new entryapproaches to arguments.", "en": " 那麼我們要怎樣來辯論 能得到些正向的東西 我們要的，是一個能有後台下的辯論策略 但我們是找不到的 除非我們有了新的途徑去辯論"}, {"zh-tw": " We need to thinkof new kinds of arguments. In order to do that, well -- I don't know how to do that.", "en": " 我們要想出新的辯論類型 為了達到這目標 恩，我不知道該怎麼做"}, {"zh-tw": " That's the bad news. The argument-as-war metaphoris just ... it's a monster.", "en": " 這不是個好消息 戰爭式辯論太可怕了"}, {"zh-tw": " It's just taken up habitation in our mind, and there's no magic bulletthat's going to kill it. There's no magic wandthat's going to make it disappear.", "en": " 它會充斥我們的思維 沒有魔法子彈能夠消滅它 沒有魔法棒來讓它消失"}, {"zh-tw": " I don't have an answer. But I have some suggestions.", "en": " 我沒有答案 但我有些建議"}, {"zh-tw": " Here's my suggestion: If we want to thinkof new kinds of arguments, what we need to dois think of new kinds of arguers. So try this: Think of all the rolesthat people play in arguments.", "en": " 我的建議如下 如果要想出新的辯論類型 我們就需要想出新類別的辯論者 這麼說吧 想想人們在辯論中扮演的所有角色"}, {"zh-tw": " There's the proponent and the opponent in an adversarial, dialectical argument. There's the audiencein rhetorical arguments.", "en": " 有支持方以及反對方 存在一個對立、辯證的辯論中 在修辭辯論中，存在著觀眾"}, {"zh-tw": " There's the reasonerin arguments as proofs. All these different roles.", "en": " 在論證辯論中，存在著推理的人"}, {"zh-tw": " Now, can you imagine an argumentin which you are the arguer, but you're also in the audience,watching yourself argue? Can you imagine yourselfwatching yourself argue, losing the argument, and yet still,at the end of the argument, saying, \"Wow, that was a good argument!\" Can you do that? I think you can, and I thinkif you can imagine that kind of argument, where the loser says to the winnerand the audience and the jury can say, \"Yeah, that was a good argument,\" then you have imagined a good argument. And more than that, I think you've imagined a good arguer, an arguer that's worthy of the kindof arguer you should try to be.", "en": " 這些不同的角色中，你能否想像有一場辯論 你同時是辯論者，也是觀眾 看著你自己在辯論呢？ 你能否想像當你看著自己在辯論時 就算輸了，在辯論結束後 你仍說「這真是一場好棒的辯論。」 你可以做到嗎？我想你可以 我認為，如果你能想像這樣的辯論 輸掉的一方能對贏的人 觀眾以及陪審團說 「對阿，這是一場很棒的辯論。」 那你所想的就是場好的辯論 此外，我認為你也可以想像 一位好的辯論者 一個值得你效法的辯論者"}, {"zh-tw": " Now, I lose a lot of arguments. It takes practice to become a good arguer, in the sense of being able to benefitfrom losing, but fortunately, I've had many, many colleagueswho have been willing to step up and provide that practice for me.", "en": " 我輸過很多次辯論 成為一位好的辯論者需要練習 也就是能從失敗中學到東西 幸運的是，我有太多，太多的同事 他們都願意挺我，為我提供練習機會"}, {"zh-tw": " Thank you.", "en": " 謝謝"}], "title": "Daniel H Cohen For Argument S Sake"}
