This got me thinking.", "en": " 在聯合國 半數的國家都在推動 對侮辱宗教的處罰-- 他們稱此為反對宗教詆毀案-- 與此同時另一半的世界 正在為了保護言論自由而反擊 於是我們有了文明衝突 而在這戰火正中央的竟然是漫畫? 這逼得我思考"}, {"zh-tw": " Now you see me thinking at my kitchen table, and since you're in my kitchen, please meet my wife.

He said, \"I can chop your head off right away and bring you back to life.\" I said, \"Well, maybe we don't have time for this right now.\" \"Another time.\" So back in Abidjan, I was given a chance to lead a workshop with local cartoonists there and I thought, yes, in a context like this, cartoons can really be used as weapons against the other side.", "en": " 我去和一位Dozo領袖會面 他和我介紹他的魔力 他說\"我現在可以馬上砍掉你的頭 隨後讓你復活\" 我說\"好吧,可是我想現在我們應該沒空做這個\" \"下次吧\" 回到阿比讓, 我得到了一個在工作坊 指導當地漫畫家的機會 我想,是的 在這樣的大環境之下,漫畫極有可能 成為對付另一方的武器"}, {"zh-tw": " I mean, the press in Ivory Coast was bitterly divided -- it was compared to the media in Rwanda before the genocide -- so imagine. And what can a cartoonist do? Sometimes editors would tell their cartoonists to draw what they wanted to see, and the guy has to feed his family, right? So the idea was pretty simple.", "en": " 我的意思是,象牙海岸的媒體分裂成敵對的兩邊 有人將他們兩邊的關係和 大屠殺之前的盧安達媒體相提並論 就請各位想像一下 那麼在這種情況下漫畫家能怎麼辦? 有時候編輯會命令漫畫家 照著編輯的想法畫漫畫 但漫畫家也不會反抗,畢竟他必須養家餬口 我的想法很簡單"}, {"zh-tw": " We brought together cartoonists from all sides in Ivory Coast. We took them away from their newspaper for three days.", "en": " 我們將所有站在各種立場的象牙海岸漫畫家 聚集起來 帶他們離開報社影響三天"}, {"zh-tw": " And I asked them to do a project together, tackle the issues affecting their country in cartoons, yes, in cartoons.

And cartoons can cross boundaries, as you have seen.", "en": " 漫畫是個很好的溝通工具 不論用於傳達的訊息是好是壞 漫畫有跨越藩籬力量 我們都見識過"}, {"zh-tw": " And humor is a good way, I think, to address serious issues. And I'm very proud of what they did.", "en": " 我認為幽默也是個面對嚴肅問題 之時很好的態度 我為這些漫畫家最後的成果感到驕傲"}, {"zh-tw": " I mean, they didn't agree with each other -- that was not the point. And I didn't ask them to do nice cartoons.", "en": " 他們並沒有同意互相的論點--那不是意義所在 我也沒有請他們畫故作融洽的漫畫"}, {"zh-tw": " The first day, they were even shouting at each other. But they came up with a book, looking back at 13 years of political crisis in Ivory Coast.", "en": " 第一天的時候他們甚至大吵了一架 但最終他們完成了一本書 回顧這過去十三年來 象牙海岸所經歷過的政治危機"}, {"zh-tw": " So the idea was there. And I've been doing projects like this, in 2009 in Lebanon, this year in Kenya, back in January.", "en": " 所以這個想法便誕生了 我一直在做像這樣的工作 2009年在黎巴嫩 今年的一月份,則是在肯亞"}, {"zh-tw": " In Lebanon, it was not a book. The idea was to have -- the same principal, a divided country -- take cartoonists from all sides and let them do something together.", "en": " 在黎巴嫩,最後的成果不是本書 我們的理念是讓-- 一樣的原理, 一個分裂的國家-- 聚集起所有不同立場的漫畫家 讓他們一起做些什麼"}, {"zh-tw": " So in Lebanon, we enrolled the newspaper editors, and we got them to publish eight cartoonists from all sides all together on the same page, addressing the issue affecting Lebanon, like religion in politics and everyday life. And it worked.", "en": " 在黎巴嫩 我們招收報紙編輯們 讓他們幫忙出版 八位來自不同政治立場漫畫家的漫畫印在同一個報紙版面上 探討影響黎巴嫩的時事 例如政治裡的宗教和人民的日常生活 它成功了"}, {"zh-tw": " For three days, almost all the newspapers of Beirut published all those cartoonists together -- anti-government, pro-government, Christian, Muslim, of course, English-speaking, well, you name it. So this was a great project.", "en": " 三天以來,幾乎所有貝魯特的報紙 都一起印了那些漫畫-- 反政府的, 支持政府的, 基督教的, 當然也有伊斯蘭教的, 英文報紙,只要你說得出來的報紙,通通都有 這是個很傑出的企劃"}, {"zh-tw": " And then in Kenya, what we did was addressing the issue of ethnicity, which is a poison in a lot of places in Africa. And we did video clips -- you can see them if you go to YouTube/Kenyatoons.", "en": " 之後在肯亞,我們做的 則是審視族群問題 這個問題侵害非洲很多地方猶如毒藥一般 我們做了一些短片 如果你想觀賞它們的話,請上YouTube/ Kenya Tunes."}, {"zh-tw": " So, preaching for freedom of speech is easy here, but as you have seen in contexts of repression or division, again, what can a cartoonist do? He has to keep his job. Well I believe that in any context anywhere, he always has the choice at least not to do a cartoon that will feed hatred.", "en": " 所以,雖然為言論自由發聲 在這裡是件簡單的事情 可是,就像你看到的 在充滿壓迫或是歧見的地方 我們要再次問到, 漫畫家能做什麼? 他必須保全他的工作 我相信在任何的環境任何的地方 他至少隨時都可以選擇 不去畫一篇 會餵養憎恨的漫畫"}, {"zh-tw": " And that's the message I try to convey to them. I think we all always have the choice in the end not to do the bad thing.", "en": " 這就是我想要向他們傳達的理念 我相信我們最終都有這一個選項 不去做壞事"}, {"zh-tw": " But we need to support these [unclear], critical and responsible voices in Africa, in Lebanon, in your local newspaper, in the Apple store. Today, tech companies are the world's largest editors.", "en": " 可是我們也需要支持 這些[不清晰],關鍵性的 負責任的聲音 不論是在非洲,在黎巴嫩 在地區性的報紙上, 還是在蘋果電腦的商店裡 今天,科技公司 是世界上最有影響力的編輯"}, {"zh-tw": " They decide what is too offensive or too provocative for you to see. So really, it's not about the freedom of cartoonists; it's about your freedoms.", "en": " 他們決定了什麼太有具攻擊性 什麼又是太過煽動,不適合你看 所以,我的演講其實不是在談漫畫家的自由 而是關於你的自由"}, {"zh-tw": " And for dictators all over the world, the good news is when cartoonists, journalists and activists shut up. Thank you.", "en": " 畢竟對全世界的獨裁者來說 最好的消息 就是當漫畫家 記者和社會運動家閉嘴都的時候了 謝謝大家 (鼓掌)"}], "title": "Patrick Chappatte The Power Of Cartoons"}
