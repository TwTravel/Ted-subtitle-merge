I say there are two things. One is people need a guarantee they won't be evicted.", "en": " 問題是泥磚小屋如何 演化為先進的都市 甚至跟蘇丹貝里一樣先進 我覺得有兩個要點 一個是住戶要有不會被迫搬遷的保障"}, {"zh-tw": " That does not necessarily mean property rights, and I would disagree with Hernando de Soto on that question, because property rights create a lot of complications. They're most often sold to people, and people then wind up in debt and have to pay back the debt, and sometimes have to sell their property in order to pay back the debt.", "en": " 這不一定指不動產擁有權 就這方面 我跟赫南度迪梭托的看法不一 因為不動產所有權會帶來很多問題 買主往往在買了不動產之後就負債 然後就得籌錢償債 有時候就得賣掉他們的不動產 來償還債務"}, {"zh-tw": " There's a whole variety of other reasons why property rights sometimes don't work in these cases, but they do need security of tenure. And they need access to politics, and that can mean two things.", "en": " 有很多種理由 導致不動產權 在這種狀況中失去意義 但是他們確實需要有保障的居住期限 他們也需要參與政治 這有兩種意義"}, {"zh-tw": " That can mean community organizing from below, but it can also mean possibilities from above. And I say that because the system in Turkey is notable.", "en": " 可以是社區由下而上的組織 或是由上而下 這在土耳其的系統裡一目了然"}, {"zh-tw": " Turkey has two great laws that protect squatters. One is that -- it's called \"gecekondu\" in Turkish, which means \"built overnight,\" and if you build your house overnight in Turkey, you can't be evicted without due process of law, if they don't catch you during the night.", "en": " 土耳其有兩個很棒的法律保障貧民 一個在土耳其文叫做 geckondu 代表徹夜打造 在土耳其 如果你在一夜之間蓋好房子 當晚也沒有人舉發你 就沒有人能經由法律途徑驅逐你"}, {"zh-tw": " And the second aspect is that once you have 2,000 people in the community, you can petition the government to be recognized as a legal sub-municipality. And when you're a legal sub-municipality, you suddenly have politics.", "en": " 第二個原因則是 當一個社區 有兩千個人的時候 就可以跟政府請願 要求被承認為一個合法的附屬行政區 成為一個合法的附屬行政區之後 就會產生政治"}, {"zh-tw": " You're allowed to have an elected government, collect taxes, provide municipal services, and that's exactly what they do.
