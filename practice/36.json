This is Hosinia, the largest and most urbanized favela in Rio de Janeiro."}, {"zh-tw": "這張是蘇丹貝利它是伊斯坦堡最大的貧民社區之一它們就是我眼中的明日之城新世界城市", "en": "And this is Sultanbelyi, which is one of the largest squatter communities in Istanbul. They are what I consider to be the cities of tomorrow, the new urban world."}, {"zh-tw": "我會什麼這樣說跟你解釋之前 我得先談談這個傢伙他的名字是朱利亞斯他是我住在基貝拉的最後一週認識的", "en": "Now, why do I say that? To tell you about that I have to talk about this fellow here, his name is Julius. And I met Julius the last week that I was living in Kibera."}, {"zh-tw": "我在那裏待了將近三個月在這城市裡的各個貧民區穿梭朱利亞斯瞪大了眼睛 跟著我到處去有一次我們到處走的時候他突然緊抓我的手 撐住他自己就肯亞人而言 這幾乎是不可能發生的他們非常禮貌 而且很慢熟", "en": "So, I had been there almost three months, and I was touring around the city going to different squatter areas and Julius was tagging along, and he was bug eyed and at certain points we were walking around, he grabbed my hand for support, which is something most Kenyans would never consider doing. They're very polite and they don't get so forward so quickly."}, {"zh-tw": "我後來才知道 原來那是朱利亞斯第一次到奈洛比他是許多人之一因為每天有將近200,000人從鄉下移居到都市裡來", "en": "And I found out later that it was Julius' first day in Nairobi, and he's one of many. So, close to 200,000 people a day migrate from the rural to the urban areas."}, {"zh-tw": "以數據公平的說明的話我們今天早上談的不是一週將近150萬人而是一週將近140萬人 但身為一個記者誇大一點的形容 就是一週150萬人一年將近7000萬人如果你算一下 那可是每分鐘130人", "en": "That's, and I'm going to be fair to the statisticians who talked this morning, not almost 1.5 million people a week, but almost 1.4 million people a week but I'm a journalist, and we exaggerate, so almost 1.5 million people a week, close to 70 million people a year. And if you do the math, that's 130 people every minute."}, {"zh-tw": "我在這邊演講的18分鐘內大約有2000到3000人遷移到都市了再來看看數據", "en": "So, that'll be -- in the 18 minutes that I'm given to talk here, between two and three thousand people will have journeyed to the cities.

It was a 10 by 10 cell."}, {"zh-tw": "小阿姆斯壯.歐布萊恩 跟另外三個男人共住阿姆斯壯跟他的朋友們沒有水他們跟附近水龍頭的主人買水沒有廁所 這個院落的家庭共用一個茅坑這裡沒有汙水道或衛生設施", "en": "Armstrong O'Brian, Jr. shared it with three other men. Armstrong and his friends had no water -- they bought it from a nearby tap owner -- no toilet -- the families in this compound shared a single pit-latrine -- and no sewers or sanitation."}, {"zh-tw": "他們以前有電不過那是從別人家非法接來的電而且只夠點亮一顆電燈泡這是Southland 一個鐵皮屋社區在肯亞奈洛比的西邊", "en": "They did have electricity, but it was illegal service tapped from someone else's wires, and could only power one feeble bulb. This was Southland, a small shanty community on the western side of Nairobi, Kenya."}, {"zh-tw": "不過其實這也可能是城市裡任何一角因為奈洛比一半以上的人都住在這種地方1500萬人擠在一堆鐵皮土角屋沒有基礎設施 沒有廁所 沒有權力", "en": "But it could've been anywhere in the city, because more than half the city of Nairobi lives like this. 1.5 million people stuffed into mud or metal huts with no services, no toilets, no rights."}, {"zh-tw": "阿姆斯壯說明了他們嚴苛的處境他們每月的房租1500先令 大約美金20塊在肯亞的鐵皮屋社區裡 這算是比較貴的他們的手頭很緊 收入不能有任何延誤如果你欠了一個月的房租 房東會帶他的手下來把你趕出去 他也會沒收你的東西 阿姆斯壯說", "en": "\"Armstrong explained the brutal reality of their situation: they paid 1,500 shillings in rent, about 20 bucks a month, a relatively high price for a Kenyan shantytown, and they could not afford to be late with the money. 'In case you owe one month, the landlord will come with his henchmen and bundle you out. He will confiscate your things,' Armstrong said."}, {"zh-tw": "一個月 甚至 一天都不行 他的室友 希拉瑞.其巴堅地.翁蘇姆說他正在煮烏卡利 一種玉米粉做成的白色粥這是國家的主食 回歸主題他們稱房東為瓦本西 意思是他是一個有錢到能開賓士的人", "en": "'Not one month, one day,' his roommate Hilary Kibagendi Onsomu, who was cooking ugali, the spongy white cornmeal concoction that is the staple food in the country, cut into the conversation. They called their landlord a Wabenzi, meaning that he is a person who has enough money to drive a Mercedes-Benz."}, {"zh-tw": "希拉瑞拿番茄炒肉配烏卡利太陽把鐵皮屋頂曬的熱騰騰我們邊吃邊流汗吃飽後 阿姆斯壯調整他的領帶穿上一件羊毛的運動外套 走到外頭的烈陽下", "en": "Hilary served the ugali with a fry of meat and tomatoes; the sun slammed down on the thin steel roof; and we perspired as we ate. \"After we finished, Armstrong straightened his tie, put on a wool sports jacket, and we headed out into the glare."}, {"zh-tw": "外面的垃圾堆成了邊界隔開Southland跟緊鄰的合法社區Langata這搭約有8尺高 40尺長 10尺寬", "en": "Outside a mound of garbage formed the border between Southland and the adjacent legal neighborhood of Langata. It was perhaps eight feet tall, 40 feet long, and 10 feet wide."}, {"zh-tw": "被一圈汙水環繞著我們經過的時候 有兩個男孩爬上肯亞的垃圾山", "en": "And it was set in a wider watery ooze. As we passed, two boys were climbing the mount Kenya of trash."}, {"zh-tw": "他們年紀不過五 六 歲他們打著赤腳 每一步都讓腳趾陷入了垃圾堆引起垃圾堆上 上百隻蒼蠅的一陣騷動", "en": "They couldn't have been more than five or six years old. They were barefoot, and with each step their toes sank into the muck sending hundreds of flies scattering from the rancid pile."}, {"zh-tw": "我原本以為他們在玩山丘之王的遊戲 可是我錯了其中一個男孩爬到垃圾山頂之後脫下褲子 蹲下來大便", "en": "I thought they might be playing King of the Hill, but I was wrong. Once atop the pile, one of the boys lowered his shorts, squatted, and defecated."}, {"zh-tw": "貪婪的蒼蠅在他腿邊飛來飛去當20個家庭 100人上下 共用一個茅坑一個小男孩上垃圾堆上大號 可能變的稀鬆平常", "en": "The flies buzzed hungrily around his legs. When 20 families -- 100 people or so -- share a single latrine, a boy pooping on a garbage pile is perhaps no big thing."}, {"zh-tw": "但這跟阿姆斯壯在吃飯時後說的話對比反差很大他說他很珍惜這社區給予的生活水準對阿姆斯壯而言 Southland不受物質條件侷限", "en": "But it stood in jarring contrast to something Armstrong had said as we were eating -- that he treasured the quality of life in his neighborhood. \"For Armstrong, Southland wasn't constrained by its material conditions."}, {"zh-tw": "相反的 這裡發揮的是人的精神這一堆鐵皮垃圾堆提供的是任何一個河法社區都無法給的自由他說 這種地方很容易上癮", "en": "Instead, the human spirit radiated out from the metal walls and garbage heaps to offer something no legal neighborhood could: freedom. 'This place is very addictive,' he had said."}, {"zh-tw": "這種簡單的生活 沒有任何人會限制你沒人管你的所作所為", "en": "'It's a simple life, but nobody is restricting you. Nobody is controlling what you do."}, {"zh-tw": "你一旦在這邊生活 就無法回頭了他說的回頭 只的是遠離這堆垃圾山回到合法的城市 跟合法的建築物擁有合法的租約跟權益他說 你一旦在這邊住過你就可以在這裡終老了所以他有希望 這種社區也是這樣開始的", "en": "Once you have stayed here, you cannot go back.' He meant back beyond that mountain of trash, back in the legal city, of legal buildings, with legal leases and legal rights. 'Once you have stayed here,' he said, 'you can stay for the rest of your life.'\" So, he has hope, and this is where these communities start."}, {"zh-tw": "這大概是基貝拉可以找到最原始的鐵皮屋了差不多就是垃圾堆旁的一根木棍跟泥塊組成的這是為印度孟買的梅雨季做的準備", "en": "This is perhaps the most primitive shanty that you can find in Kibera, little more than a stick-and-mud hut next to a garbage heap. This is getting ready for the monsoon in Bombay, India."}, {"zh-tw": "這是家居裝修在屋頂上蓋一些塑膠蓬布這是里約熱內盧 稍微好一點 對吧我們看到的是零碎的瓦片 跟小塊的招牌磚塊上抹過泥灰 塗上了顏色這是蘇瑞蒙塔卡亞的家 在蘇丹貝利 狀況更好了", "en": "This is home improvement: putting plastic tarps on your roof. This is in Rio de Janeiro, and it's getting a bit better, right? We're seeing scavenged terra cotta tile and little pieces of signs, and plaster over the brick, some color, and this is Sulay Montakaya's house in Sultanbelyi, and it's getting even better."}, {"zh-tw": "他有圍牆 還有一塊破破的門板他的屋頂上有新的瓦磚然後再來看看荷西尼亞看的出來 更優渥了", "en": "He's got a fence; he scavenged a door; he's got new tile on the roof. And then you get Rocinha and you can see that it's getting even better."}, {"zh-tw": "這些建築物不只一樓高在遠端右側可以看到他們發展一個個堆疊起來的建築屋子上的屋子 一間又一間", "en": "The buildings here are multi-story. They develop -- you can see on the far right one where it seems to just stack on top of each other, room, after room, after room."}, {"zh-tw": "這邊的住家由一到兩層樓組成然後販售自家陽台或屋頂的使用權然後就有人在他們加樓上蓋房子然後那個人再販售他的屋頂使用權下一個人就會在他的屋頂上在疊造另一個建築物這些建築全都是鋼筋混凝土跟磚塊蓋的", "en": "And what people do is they develop their home on one or two stories, and they sell their loggia or roof rights, and someone else builds on top of their building, and then that person sells the roof rights, and someone else builds on top of their building. All of these buildings are made out of reinforced concrete and brick."}, {"zh-tw": "我們來看土耳其的蘇丹貝里這裡的建築設計等級又更高了前面的那一團是床墊的填塞物整個土耳其都看的到這東西", "en": "And then you get Sultanbelyi, in Turkey, where it's even built to a higher level of design. The crud in the front is mattress stuffing, and you see that all over Turkey."}, {"zh-tw": "大家在屋頂上曝曬床墊填塞物但是在後面的綠色建築物你會發現那頂樓是空的所以那邊可能有擴建的可能", "en": "People dry out or air out their mattress stuffing on their roofs. But the green building, on behind, you can see that the top floor is not occupied, so people are building with the possibility of expansion."}, {"zh-tw": "其實建築的設計性挺高的最後你會看到這種的貧民住宅根據都市郊區建築為模型", "en": "And it's built to a pretty high standard of design. And then you finally get squatter homes like this, which is built on the suburban model."}, {"zh-tw": "那是貧民社區裡的獨棟住宅同樣位於土耳其 伊斯坦堡", "en": "Hey, that's a single family home in the squatter community. That's also in Istanbul, Turkey."}, {"zh-tw": "這都是很關鍵的區域 這種社區這是荷西尼亞的中心地帶-伊斯塔爾達 達蓋維亞有一路公車行經這區塊很多人在街道上", "en": "They're quite vital places, these communities. This is the main drag of Rocinha, the Estrada da Gavea, and there's a bus route that runs through it, lots of people out on the street."}, {"zh-tw": "對都會而言 這類社區比起非法社區更加重要這裡的活動比較多", "en": "These communities in these cities are actually more vital than the illegal communities. They have more things going on in them."}, {"zh-tw": "這是荷西尼亞的典型道路 叫做 beco社區裡的道路都是這模樣非常陡峭的地勢", "en": "This is a typical pathway in Rocinha called a \"beco\" -- these are how you get around the community. It's on very steep ground."}, {"zh-tw": "它們築在山丘上 跟里約的沙灘比起來算是內陸你可以看到房子懸在天然障礙物上像是山丘上的岩石", "en": "They're built on the hills, inland from the beaches in Rio, and you can see that the houses are just cantilevered over the natural obstructions. So, that's just a rock in the hillside."}, {"zh-tw": "還有這種 因為太壅擠了人們把家具或是冰箱都扛上去各式各樣都有啤酒也是靠雙肩扛上去的", "en": "And these becos are normally very crowded, and people hump furniture up them, or refrigerators up them, all sorts of things. Beer is all carried in on your shoulders."}, {"zh-tw": "在巴西 啤酒非常的重要這是肯亞的商業區 沿著火車鐵軌距離鐵軌相當近 所以商人有時候還得把商品移開", "en": "Beer is a very important thing in Brazil. This is commerce in Kenya, right along the train tracks, so close to the train tracks that the merchants sometimes have to pull the merchandise out of the way."}, {"zh-tw": "這是市集 也是在肯亞 托伊市集很多商人 商品應有盡有前景看到的這些綠色東西是芒果", "en": "This is a marketplace, also in Kenya, Toi Market, lots of dealers, in almost everything you want to buy. Those green things in the foreground are mangoes."}, {"zh-tw": "這是位於基貝拉的購物街這邊可以看的一個賣汽水的小販 還有診所兩家美容院 兩家雜貨店 一間教堂 還有其他的這是典型的市區街道 自行演化而成的", "en": "This is a shopping street in Kibera, and you can see that there's a soda dealer, a health clinic, two beauty salons, a bar, two grocery stores, and a church, and more. It's a typical downtown street; it just happens to be self-built."}, {"zh-tw": "右邊這個就是我們說的 如果你看一下遮陽板上的印刷就是飯店肯亞跟印度一樣 飯店指的是吃飯的地方", "en": "This here, on the right-hand side, is what's called a -- if you look at the fine print under the awning -- it's a hotel. And what hotel means, in Kenya and India, is an eating-place."}, {"zh-tw": "所以這其實是餐館在里約 電會被偷接", "en": "So, that's a restaurant. People steal electrical power -- this is Rio."}, {"zh-tw": "他們從這裡接電 這些小偷又叫做蟋蟀他們偷接電給周遭鄰居清除垃圾的方法就是放火燒他們也自己挖污水溝", "en": "People tap in and they have thieves who are called \"grillos\" or \"crickets,\" and they steal the electrical power and wire the neighborhood. People burn trash to get rid of the garbage, and they dig their own sewer channels."}, {"zh-tw": "說說這些比浮游生物還多的塑膠袋有時候也有天然的垃圾處理法", "en": "Talk about more plastic bags than plankton. And sometimes they have natural trash-disposal."}, {"zh-tw": "當生活好一點的時候 就會鋪水泥路在安裝污水溝更新水管之類的這是接到里約的水管 水管接的到處都是那邊的小屋裏頭有個泵 他們都是這樣用的偷接電 然後安裝泵然後再把水引到房屋", "en": "And when they have more money they cement their streets, and they put in sewers and good water pipes, and stuff like that. This is water going to Rio. People run their water pipes all over the place, and that little hut right there has a pump in it, and that's what people do: they steal electricity; they install a pump and they tap into the water main, and pump water up to their houses."}, {"zh-tw": "問題是泥磚小屋如何演化為先進的都市 甚至跟蘇丹貝里一樣先進我覺得有兩個要點一個是住戶要有不會被迫搬遷的保障", "en": "So, the question is how do you go from the mud-hut village, to the more developed city, to the even highly developed Sultanbelyi? I say there are two things. One is people need a guarantee they won't be evicted."}, {"zh-tw": "這不一定指不動產擁有權就這方面 我跟赫南度迪梭托的看法不一因為不動產所有權會帶來很多問題買主往往在買了不動產之後就負債然後就得籌錢償債有時候就得賣掉他們的不動產來償還債務", "en": "That does not necessarily mean property rights, and I would disagree with Hernando de Soto on that question, because property rights create a lot of complications. They're most often sold to people, and people then wind up in debt and have to pay back the debt, and sometimes have to sell their property in order to pay back the debt."}, {"zh-tw": "有很多種理由 導致不動產權在這種狀況中失去意義但是他們確實需要有保障的居住期限他們也需要參與政治 這有兩種意義", "en": "There's a whole variety of other reasons why property rights sometimes don't work in these cases, but they do need security of tenure. And they need access to politics, and that can mean two things."}, {"zh-tw": "可以是社區由下而上的組織或是由上而下這在土耳其的系統裡一目了然", "en": "That can mean community organizing from below, but it can also mean possibilities from above. And I say that because the system in Turkey is notable."}, {"zh-tw": "土耳其有兩個很棒的法律保障貧民一個在土耳其文叫做 geckondu代表徹夜打造 在土耳其 如果你在一夜之間蓋好房子當晚也沒有人舉發你就沒有人能經由法律途徑驅逐你", "en": "Turkey has two great laws that protect squatters. One is that -- it's called \"gecekondu\" in Turkish, which means \"built overnight,\" and if you build your house overnight in Turkey, you can't be evicted without due process of law, if they don't catch you during the night."}, {"zh-tw": "第二個原因則是 當一個社區有兩千個人的時候 就可以跟政府請願要求被承認為一個合法的附屬行政區成為一個合法的附屬行政區之後 就會產生政治", "en": "And the second aspect is that once you have 2,000 people in the community, you can petition the government to be recognized as a legal sub-municipality. And when you're a legal sub-municipality, you suddenly have politics."}, {"zh-tw": "可以有民選政府 也可以徵收稅款來提供行政區的服務 他們採取的正是這種方法這些人是未來的民意領袖", "en": "You're allowed to have an elected government, collect taxes, provide municipal services, and that's exactly what they do. So, these are the civic leaders of the future."}, {"zh-tw": "在中間的這位女士 是 姬塔齊瓦他住在孟買高速公路旁的帳篷裡", "en": "The woman in the center is Geeta Jiwa. She lives in one of those tents on the highway median in Mumbai."}, {"zh-tw": "這是蘇芮卡甘地 他跟家人一起住在同一條高速公路旁的帳篷裡她們直言不諱 非常活躍", "en": "That's Sureka Gundi; she also lives with her family on the tent along the same highway median. They're very outspoken. They're very active."}, {"zh-tw": "他們可以當社區領袖這個女人叫做 Nine 土耳其文的意思是奶奶", "en": "They can be community leaders. This woman is Nine, which means \"grandma\" in Turkish."}, {"zh-tw": "那邊曾經住了三個老太太她身後的房子是自建的 他們已經住了30 40年了他們是這社區的支柱這位是理查牧塔瑪彼得他是基貝拉的街頭攝影師", "en": "And there were three old ladies who lived in -- that's her self-built house behind her -- and they've lived there for 30 or 40 years, and they are the backbone of the community there. This is Richard Muthama Peter, and he is an itinerant street photographer in Kibera."}, {"zh-tw": "他以拍攝社區及居民的照片維生他也是社區裡重要資源最後是席季尼歐 我支持他競選里約市長一個水果商跟他的兩個小孩我沒認識比他更誠實 大方 又溫暖的人了", "en": "He makes money taking pictures of the neighborhood, and the people in the neighborhood, and is a great resource in the community. And finally my choice to run for mayor of Rio is Cezinio, the fruit merchant with his two kids here, and a more honest and giving and caring man I don't know."}, {"zh-tw": "這些社區的未來在這些人的手上也決定於我們跟他們的合作能力從書上得知的 如同阿姆斯壯以及所有人所說這些是確確實實的社區", "en": "The future of these communities is in the people and in our ability to work with those people. So, I think the message I take, from what I read from the book, from what Armstrong said, and from all these people, is that these are neighborhoods."}, {"zh-tw": "問題的所在 不是都市貧窮也不在於這議題涵蓋的面積有多大多廣", "en": "The issue is not urban poverty. The issue is not the larger, over-arching thing."}, {"zh-tw": "真正的問題在於我們如何看待這些社區這是合理的都市發展而都市必須納入這些居民因為他們打造的是未來的都市謝謝大家", "en": "The issue is for us to recognize that these are neighborhoods -- this is a legitimate form of urban development -- and that cities have to engage these residents, because they are building the cities of the future.
