You have the event structure, the common ground that the words are about, coming out of the television feeds; you've got the conversations that are about those topics; and through semantic analysis -- and this is actually real data you're looking at from our data processing -- each yellow line is showing a link being made between a comment in the wild and a piece of event structure coming out of the television signal.", "en": " 於是我們每個月抽取 大約三十億則電視評論 然後美妙的事發生了 這當中可以找到事件結構 那些字詞內容的共同基礎 從這些電視訊息裡透露出來 我們取得了關於 那些話題的談話 再經過語意分析－大家現在看到的 確實是來自於我們進行 資料處理的真實資料－ 每一條黃線顯示一則評論 在外間造成的連結 於是從電視訊號逐漸顯出一點事件的結構"}, {"zh-tw": " And the same idea now can be built up.
