Why do you need the plants anymore? You can just take the DNA code from marijuana or poppies or coca leaves and cut and past that gene and put it into yeast, and you can take those yeast and make them make the cocaine for you, or the marijuana, or any other drug. So how we use yeast in the future is going to be really interesting.", "en": " 舉例來說，我預測我們將不再依賴 以植物做出的麻醉藥品 而改用人工合成。那你還需要植物幹啥？ 你只要把大麻的DNA序列 或罌粟花，可可葉的DNA 只要複製這些基因 放到酵母裡 你就可以用這些酵母 做出古柯鹼 大麻，或其他毒品 所以，將來人們如何使用酵母 會非常有趣"}, {"zh-tw": " In fact, we may have some really interesting bread and beer as we go into this next century.
