And it would be easy to implement and inexpensive.", "en": " 現在，假如歐巴馬總統 邀請我擔任下一個數學教育總管 我將對他提個建議 我認為將會大幅改善 國內的數學教育 而且可以很容易實施 而且費用不多。"}, {"zh-tw": " The mathematics curriculum that we have is based on a foundation of arithmetic and algebra. And everything we learn after that is building up towards one subject.", "en": " 我們現在的數學課程 是以算術與代數為基礎， 而在那之後所學的一切 都在朝著同一個主題發展"}, {"zh-tw": " And at top of that pyramid, it's calculus. And I'm here to say that I think that that is the wrong summit of the pyramid ...", "en": " 在這金字塔的頂端，就是微積分 我在這裡要說 我認為這是個錯誤的目標"}, {"zh-tw": " that the correct summit -- that all of our students, every high school graduate should know -- should be statistics: probability and statistics. I mean, don't get me wrong. Calculus is an important subject.", "en": " 而正確的目標，對全體學生而言 每一個畢業生應該知道的 應該是統計 機率與統計 鼓掌聲 請別誤會，微積分是個重要的學科"}, {"zh-tw": " It's one of the great products of the human mind. The laws of nature are written in the language of calculus.", "en": " 它是人類心智最重要的產物之一 大自然的定律是以微積分來描述的"}, {"zh-tw": " And every student who studies math, science, engineering, economics, they should definitely learn calculus by the end of their freshman year of college. But I'm here to say, as a professor of mathematics, that very few people actually use calculus in a conscious, meaningful way, in their day-to-day lives.", "en": " 每一個學習數學、科學、工程、經濟的學生 他們絕對需要學習微積分 在他們大一就得學會 但身為一個數學教授，我要說 很少人會實際用到微積分 以有意識、有意義的方式，用在日常生活中"}, {"zh-tw": " On the other hand, statistics -- that's a subject that you could, and should, use on daily basis. Right? It's risk. It's reward. It's randomness. It's understanding data.", "en": " 但另一方面 統計學--是你可以應用的學科 並且應該在日常生活中使用的，對嗎？ 它討論風險、報償、隨機性 它是了解數據的工具"}, {"zh-tw": " I think if our students, if our high school students -- if all of the American citizens -- knew about probability and statistics, we wouldn't be in the economic mess that we're in today. Not only -- thank you -- not only that ...", "en": " 我想，如果我們的學生， 如果所有的美國人民 懂得機率與統計學 我們就不會陷入今天這場經濟風暴 不止這樣"}, {"zh-tw": " but if it's taught properly, it can be a lot of fun. I mean, probability and statistics, it's the mathematics of games and gambling.", "en": " 如果教法適當，它可以是很有趣的 機率與統計 它是遊戲與賭博的數學"}, {"zh-tw": " It's analyzing trends. It's predicting the future. Look, the world has changed from analog to digital.", "en": " 它分析趨勢、預測未來 你看，這世界已經改變了 從類比式的變成數位式"}, {"zh-tw": " And it's time for our mathematics curriculum to change from analog to digital, from the more classical, continuous mathematics, to the more modern, discrete mathematics -- the mathematics of uncertainty, of randomness, of data -- that being probability and statistics. In summary, instead of our students learning about the techniques of calculus, I think it would be far more significant if all of them knew what two standard deviations from the mean means. And I mean it.", "en": " 也是改變我們數學課程的時候了 從類比式變成數位式 從古典、連續式的數學 變成更現代、分離式的數學 探討不確定性的數學 探討數據的隨機性 那就是機率與統計 簡要的說，與其 讓學生學微積分 我想更重要的是 讓他們了解，距離平均值兩個標準差 代表什麼意思，會更有意義"}, {"zh-tw": " Thank you very much.", "en": " 謝謝大家 鼓掌聲"}], "title": "Arthur Benjamin S Formula For Changing Math Education"}
