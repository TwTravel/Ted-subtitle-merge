And I love that moment in this video, because before it became a shared experience, it was something that was maybe a little bit scary, or something that was at least confusing to her.", "en": " 注意女孩和他們兩個的眼神交流 我超喜歡這一幕 因為在這成為共享的經驗之前 我們的表現可能有點嚇人 或是讓她感到困惑"}, {"zh-tw": " And then once it became a shared experience, it was funny and something that she could laugh at.

That's exactly what I needed today,\" and then exited without revealing what had happened and went in all different directions. Thank you.", "en": " 我們也就真的一人買了一條褲子穿上 接著說：「謝謝，這褲子來得真及時」 然後裝作什麽也沒發生一樣 很自然地朝不同方向離開了車站 謝謝"}, {"zh-tw": " So that's a still from the video there. And I love that girl's reaction so much.", "en": " 這也是剛才那個影片裡的一幕 我太喜歡那姑娘的反應了"}, {"zh-tw": " And watching that videotape later that day inspired me to keep doing what I do.

Well one day I was walking through Union Square, and I saw this building, which had just been built in 2005.", "en": " 這樣我就可以做一些大企劃了 有一天我走過聯合廣場的時候 看到這棟 剛在2005年建好的樓"}, {"zh-tw": " And there was a girl in one of the windows and she was dancing.

So it seemed like maybe she had been dared to do this.", "en": " 15秒後，她的朋友出現了 之前她一直藏在一個陳列品後面 她們擁抱大笑，然後一起離開了 看起來像是她們在玩真心話大冒險"}, {"zh-tw": " So I got inspired by that.

And then we had dancing. We had everyone dance.", "en": " 你們看到的是剛開始的時候 接下來是跳舞，所有人一起跳"}, {"zh-tw": " And then we had dance solos where only one person would dance and everybody would point to them.

So that particular event was inspired by a moment that I happened to stumble upon.", "en": " 這是一張更棒的照片 這一個特別的行動 是我從感到困惑的一幕中 獲得靈感的"}, {"zh-tw": " The next project I want to show was given to me in an email from a stranger. A high school kid in Texas wrote me in 2006 and said, \"You should get as many people as possible to put on blue polo shirts and khaki pants and go into a Best Buy and stand around.\" So I wrote this high school kid back immediately, and I said, \"Yes, you are correct.", "en": " 下一個我想給大家看的企劃 是由一個陌生人發給我的電子郵件而來的 德州的一位高中生在2006年寫信給我 說：「你應該召集盡可能多的人， 都穿上藍色短袖開領衫和卡其褲， 到百思買（Best Buy）去閒逛。」 於是我立刻回信給這位高中生 我說：「你說得很對，"}, {"zh-tw": " I think I'll try to do that this weekend. Thank you.\" So here's the video. So again, this is 2005.", "en": " 我這週末就這麼做，謝謝。」 這就是當天的影片 這是2005年（之前說是2006）"}, {"zh-tw": " This is the Best Buy in New York City. We had about 80 people show up to participate, entering one-by-one.", "en": " 在紐約市的百思買（Best Buy） 我們一共80個人左右 一個接一個地走進店裡"}, {"zh-tw": " There was an eight year-old girl, a 10 year-old girl. There was also a 65 year-old man who participated.", "en": " 其中有8歲的小女孩、10歲的小女孩 還有一個65歲的老頭 一起參加這個活動"}, {"zh-tw": " So a very diverse group of people. And I told people, \"Don't work. Don't actually do work.", "en": " 非常多樣化的一群人 我告訴他們：「別幹活，別真的工作。"}, {"zh-tw": " But also, don't shop. Just stand around and don't face products.\" Now you can see the regular employees by the ones that have the yellow tags on their shirt.", "en": " 但是呢，也別買東西。 就在店裡轉轉，別面對著商品。」 現在你可以看到的這些真的員工 他們襯衫上有黃色標籤"}, {"zh-tw": " Everybody else is one of our actors. The lower level employees thought it was very funny.", "en": " 所有其他人都是我們這些演員 基層的員工覺得這很好玩"}, {"zh-tw": " And in fact, several of them went to go get their camera from the break room and took photos with us. A lot of them made jokes about trying to get us to go to the back to get heavy television sets for customers.", "en": " 以至於有幾個還從休息室拿來他們的相機 跟我們合影 許多人開玩笑讓我們到後面 去幫顧客搬很重的電視機"}, {"zh-tw": " The managers and the security guards, on the other hand, did not find it particularly funny. You can see them in this footage.", "en": " 可是經理和保安們 就不覺得這有什麽好玩的了 你們看到在這個片段裡"}, {"zh-tw": " They're wearing either a yellow shirt or a black shirt. And we were there probably 10 minutes before the managers decided to dial 911.", "en": " 他們穿著黃色或黑色的襯衫 10分鐘之後 經理就決定打911報警了"}, {"zh-tw": " So they started running around telling everybody the cops were coming, watch out, the cops were coming. And you can see the cops in this footage right here.", "en": " 然後他們開始在店裡四處亂竄 告訴大家警察就要過來了，注意點，警察馬上就要過來了 你們看到這個片段裡，警察真的過來了"}, {"zh-tw": " That's a cop wearing black right there, being filmed with a hidden camera.

So we had been there for 20 minutes; we were happy to exit the store.", "en": " 謝謝。 我們在那兒待了20分鐘，然後高高興興地出去了"}, {"zh-tw": " One thing the managers were trying to do was to track down our cameras. And they caught a couple of my guys who had hidden cameras in duffel bags.", "en": " 期間經理一直想要 追查到我們的攝影機 他們搜到了好幾個人藏在袋子裡的攝影機"}, {"zh-tw": " But the one camera guy they never caught was the guy that went in just with a blank tape and went over to the Best Buy camera department and just put his tape in one of their cameras and pretended to shop. So I like that concept of using their own technology against them.", "en": " 但是有一個他們永遠也查不到 因為有個小夥子只帶了一個空白的帶子 然後徑直走到店裡的攝影機部門 把帶子放進其中一台店裡的攝影機裡 然後假裝在買東西 我很喜歡這個\"以其人之道還治其人之身\"的概念"}, {"zh-tw": " I think our best projects are ones that are site specific and happen at a particular place for a reason. And one morning, I was riding the subway.", "en": " 我想我們那些最好的企劃都需要一些特定的地點 在一些特別的場所發生，並有著明確的原因 有天早晨，我搭乘地鐵時"}, {"zh-tw": " I had to make a transfer at the 53rd St. stop where there are these two giant escalators.

It's very cold outside.", "en": " 上班的高峰期 外面非常寒冷"}, {"zh-tw": " People are coming in from Queens, transferring from the E train to the 6 train.

So there's a photograph that illustrates it a little bit better.", "en": " （謝謝） 這裡是張更清楚點的照片"}, {"zh-tw": " He gave 2,000 high fives that day, and he washed his hands before and afterward and did not get sick. And that was done also without permission, although no one seemed to care.", "en": " 那天他擊了2000次掌（high five） 在這前後他都去洗了手 之後也沒有生病 這個活動也沒有得到相關部門的批准 雖然似乎沒人在意"}, {"zh-tw": " So I'd say over the years, one of the most common criticisms I see of Improv Everywhere left anonymously on YouTube comments is: \"These people have too much time on their hands.\" And you know, not everybody's going to like everything you do, and I've certainly developed a thick skin thanks to Internet comments, but that one's always bothered me, because we don't have too much time on our hands. The participants at Improv Everywhere events have just as much leisure time as any other New Yorkers, they just occasionally choose to spend it in an unusual way.", "en": " 這麼多年來 YouTube上的匿名評論裡 對Improv Everywhere最多的批評 就是：「這些人太閒了。」 你知道，並不是每個人都會喜歡你做的每件事 感謝這些網民的評論，我的臉皮越來越厚了 但是這個評價一直讓我很不舒服 因為我們恰恰缺的就是時間 Improv Everywhere這些活動的參與者們 並不比其他普通的紐約客來的閒 他們只是偶爾 用不尋常的方式打發這些時間"}, {"zh-tw": " You know, every Saturday and Sunday, hundreds of thousands of people each fall gather in football stadiums to watch games. And I've never seen anybody comment, looking at a football game, saying, \"All those people in the stands, they have too much time on their hands.\" And of course they don't.", "en": " 你們知道，每年秋天 成百上千的人們在週六週日 聚在體育場看橄欖球 我也從沒見到有人看著橄欖球賽 評論說：「這些看球的人都是太閒了。」 當然他們並不是這樣"}, {"zh-tw": " It's a perfectly wonderful way to spent a weekend afternoon, watching a football game in a stadium. But I think it's also a perfectly valid way to spend an afternoon freezing in place with 200 people in the Grand Central terminal or dressing up like a ghostbuster and running through the New York Public Library.", "en": " 到體育場看橄欖球 是個非常好的度過週末下午的方式 但是我也認為下面這些都是 度過週末下午的好方式：在中央車站 與200個其他人一起靜止不動 或者打扮成“捉鬼特工隊”（魔鬼剋星） 跑過紐約公共圖書館"}, {"zh-tw": " Or listening to the same MP3 as 3,000 other people and dancing silently in a park, or bursting into song in a grocery store as part of a spontaneous musical, or diving into the ocean in Coney Island wearing formal attire. You know, as kids, we're taught to play.", "en": " 或是與其他3000人聽同一首MP3 在公園裡一起悄無聲息地跳舞 或是在雜貨店放聲唱歌 創作即興音樂劇 或是穿上正式服裝跳進康尼島（Coney Island）的海裡 你看，我們還是孩子時，別人教我們玩"}, {"zh-tw": " And we're never given a reason why we should play. It's just acceptable that play is a good thing.", "en": " 從來也沒人告訴我們玩需要什麽理由 大家都認為玩是一件很好的事"}, {"zh-tw": " And I think that's sort of the point of Improv Everywhere. It's that there is no point and that there doesn't have to be a point.", "en": " 我想這正是Improv Everywhere的動機 就是沒有目的，也不需要什麽目的"}, {"zh-tw": " We don't need a reason. As long as it's fun and it seems like it's going to be a funny idea and it seems like the people who witness it will also have a fun time, then that's enough for us.", "en": " 我們不需要原因 只要有趣 看起來像個好玩的主意 而且在現場目擊的人們也會覺得這很有意思 那對我們來說就夠了"}, {"zh-tw": " And I think, as adults, we need to learn that there's no right or wrong way to play. Thank you very much.", "en": " 我也認為，作為成年人，我們要學習認識 在玩這件事上，並沒有什麼對或錯的方式 非常感謝"}], "title": "Charlie Todd The Shared Experience Of Absurdity"}
