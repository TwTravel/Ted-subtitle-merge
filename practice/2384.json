They're all over the Internet, they're toppingblog posts and news pieces, and I've become kind of obsessed with themand the lie that they tell us and the comfort that they give us, that when it comesto new working motherhood in America, everything's fine."}, {"zh-tw": "但事實一點都不是如此，以一個國家來說我們每年不斷地把，數百萬名產後婦女送回去工作，不可思議和有點驚人的快。", "en": "But it's not fine. As a country, we are sendingmillions of women back to work every year, incrediblyand kind of horrifically soon after they give birth."}, {"zh-tw": "這是個良知的難題，不過今天我打算跟你們講為什麼它是個經濟上的難題。這些圖像的不切實際令我變得變得惱火以及困擾不已，它們看起來一點都不像我的日子！我最近打定主意拍攝以及領銜主演一系列滑稽模仿的圖庫，我希望全世界會開始使用，我只想要呈現出當嬰兒食物來源被設定在你自己身上時卻要回到工作崗位的窘境，", "en": "That's a moral problem but today I'm also going to tell youwhy it's an economic problem.

The first choice saysthat women have chosen to work."}, {"zh-tw": "那不是真的！今天在美國婦女構成 47％的勞動力，以及美國 40％的家庭裡婦女是唯一或主要的養家者；", "en": "So, that's not true. Today in America, women make up47 percent of the workforce, and in 40 percent of American households a woman is the soleor primary breadwinner."}, {"zh-tw": "我們的有支薪工作是經濟引擎裡極大的一部份，且對我們家庭動力來說是不可或缺的，以國家的層次來看－我們的有支薪工作不是任君挑選的。", "en": "Our paid work is a part, a huge part,of the engine of this economy, and it is essentialfor the engines of our families. On a national level,our paid work is not optional."}, {"zh-tw": "第二個部份說婦女「選擇」要生小孩，所以婦女應該獨自承受這些選擇的下場！那就是別人提起時聽到的那些東西其中的一項，聽起來也沒錯呀。", "en": "Choice number two says that womenare choosing to have babies, so women alone should bearthe consequences of those choices. You know, that's one of those things that when you hear it in passing,can sound correct."}, {"zh-tw": "「不是我讓你生小孩的！」、「這完全不關我的事啊！」。", "en": "I didn't make you have a baby. I certainly wasn't therewhen that happened."}, {"zh-tw": "但是這些立論忽視了基本的事實－我們的繁衍在國家的水準上是沒有選擇空間的。婦女－許多是職場婦女－今天不斷生育的小寶貝們有天將填補我們的勞動力、守護我們的海岸線、構成我們的稅基；", "en": "But that stanceignores a fundamental truth, which is that our procreationon a national scale is not optional. The babies that women, many of themworking women, are having today, will one day fill our workforce,protect our shores, make up our tax base."}, {"zh-tw": "我們的繁衍在國家層面上是沒有選擇空間的。這些並不是選擇！", "en": "Our procreationon a national scale is not optional. These aren't choices."}, {"zh-tw": "我們要有婦女工作、我們要有職場婦女生孩子；所以我們應該讓同時間做這兩碼子事至少講得通對吧？現在現場抽問時間：「在美國有多少百分比的職場婦女你認為無法獲取帶薪的育嬰假？」88％！", "en": "We need women to work.We need working women to have babies. So we should makedoing those things at the same time at least palatable, right? OK, this is pop quiz time: what percentage of workingwomen in America do you think have no access to paid maternity leave? 88 percent."}, {"zh-tw": "88％的職場婦女生完孩子以後將連 1 分鐘的帶薪假也拿不到。所以現在你正想著無薪假吧！", "en": "88 percent of working motherswill not get one minute of paid leave after they have a baby. So now you're thinking about unpaid leave."}, {"zh-tw": "它存在於美國，叫「家庭與醫療假法」（FMLA）它並不管用！因為它被成立出來的方式，所有的排除新手媽媽們半數是不符資格的！", "en": "It exists in America.It's called FMLA. It does not work. Because of the way it's structured,all kinds of exceptions, half of new mothers are ineligible for it."}, {"zh-tw": "這就是其情景：「我們領養了兒子，", "en": "Here's what that looks like. \"We adopted our son."}, {"zh-tw": "當我在他誕生的那天接到電話我就得放下工作，我的年資尚未長到可適用家庭與醫療假法，所以無薪假沒我的份。", "en": "When I got the call, the day he was born,I had to take off work. I had not been there long enoughto qualify for FMLA, so I wasn't eligible for unpaid leave."}, {"zh-tw": "當我離開崗位去見剛出世的兒子時我搞丟了工作」。這些私人企業老套的照片隱藏著現實，從另一個層面。那些只是可以取得無薪假的人，大多數根本一點也消受不起請太多假。", "en": "When I took time offto meet my newborn son, I lost my job.\" These corporate stock photoshide another reality, another layer. Of those who do have accessto just that unpaid leave, most women can't affordto take much of it at all."}, {"zh-tw": "一位護士跟我說道：「因為我的懷孕被認定是既存狀態，我不符合短期無力工作的資格；我們在我六個星期無薪假的期間用上全部的退稅金和半數的積蓄，", "en": "A nurse told me, \"I didn't qualifyfor short-term disability because my pregnancywas considered a preexisting condition. We used up all of our tax returnsand half of our savings during my six unpaid weeks."}, {"zh-tw": "我們就是做不到再請多一點假。身理上很不好受但是情感面更糟，", "en": "We just couldn't manage any longer. Physically it was hard,but emotionally it was worse."}, {"zh-tw": "不在兒子身邊讓我煎熬了好幾個月」。所以如此之早就回去工作的這個決定是受家庭財務所驅使的合理經濟決定；不過身理上經常是很駭人聽聞的，因為生出小孩來是吃力不討好的事。一位女服務生告訴我：「有了我的第一個小寶貝時產後五週我就回去工作了；", "en": "I struggled for monthsbeing away from my son.\" So this decisionto go back to work so early, it's a rational economic decisiondriven by family finances, but it's often physically horrific because putting a humaninto the world is messy. A waitress told me, \"With my first baby, I was backat work five weeks postpartum."}, {"zh-tw": "有第二個小寶貝時我必須做個大手術，所以我直到六週後才回去工作。我當時有三度會陰撕裂傷。」在美國 23％的新手職場媽媽將會在產後兩個禮拜內復職！", "en": "With my second, I had to havemajor surgery after giving birth, so I waited until six weeks to go back. I had third degree tears.\" 23 percent of newworking mothers in America will be back on the jobwithin two weeks of giving birth."}, {"zh-tw": "「身為一位酒侍以及廚師，懷孕時我一週平均工作 75 個小時，在我的小孩滿月前我就得回去工作－一週 60 個小時；", "en": "\"I worked as a bartender and cook,average of 75 hours a week while pregnant. I had to return to workbefore my baby was a month old, working 60 hours a week."}, {"zh-tw": "我有一位同事只花得起10 天的假休陪孩子。」當然這現象不只有著經濟和身理影響，生小孩一直都會是重大的心理事件。", "en": "One of my coworkers was only ableto afford 10 days off with her baby.\" Of course, this isn't just a scenariowith economic and physical implications. Childbirth is, and always will be,an enormous psychological event."}, {"zh-tw": "一位老師告訴我：「我兒子出生八週後我就復職了，我已經受焦慮所苦，但是早在我回去工作之前侵襲我的驚慌是難以忍受的」。統計上而言婦女生了小孩以後的產休越短她越有可能會遭受產後情緒異常－諸如憂鬱以及焦慮；那些異常眾多的潛在影響裡自殺是產後第一年", "en": "A teacher told me, \"I returned to workeight weeks after my son was born. I already suffer from anxiety, but the panic attacks I had priorto returning to work were unbearable.\" Statistically speaking, the shorter a woman's leaveafter having a baby, the more likely she will be to sufferfrom postpartum mood disorders like depression and anxiety, and among many potentialconsequences of those disorders, suicide is the secondmost common cause of death in a woman's first year postpartum."}, {"zh-tw": "婦女們最常見的第二死因。注意接下來這個故事－我不曾見過這個女人，但是我知道該情形很難撐過去。「我感到無比的痛心以及氣憤－我失去了伴著兒子的不可或缺、無可取代的發育時期，", "en": "Heads up that this next story -- I've never met this woman,but I find it hard to get through. \"I feel tremendous grief and ragethat I lost an essential, irreplaceable and formativetime with my son."}, {"zh-tw": "勞動和生產讓我感覺百分百報銷了。幾個月來我只記得嬰兒的哭鬧－他們說是腸絞痛；", "en": "Labor and deliveryleft me feeling absolutely broken. For months, all I rememberis the screaming: colic, they said."}, {"zh-tw": "內心的我呼吸不過來了，每天早上我問自己我還能夠做多久呢？", "en": "On the inside, I was drowning. Every morning, I asked myselfhow much longer I could do it."}, {"zh-tw": "我被允許帶著我的小寶貝上班，當我在搖哄、安撫以及乞求他停止哭鬧時我關上了我辦公室的門，以避免麻煩。", "en": "I was allowed to bring my baby to work. I closed my office doorwhile I rocked and shushed and begged him to stop screamingso I wouldn't get in trouble."}, {"zh-tw": "該死的每一天當他哭喊時我躲在辦公室的門後以及哭泣、當我清洗集乳器時我在洗手間哭泣；", "en": "I hid behind that office doorevery damn day and cried while he screamed. I cried in the bathroomwhile I washed out the pump equipment."}, {"zh-tw": "每一天我一路哭著去上班、而且再次一路哭著回家！我跟老闆保證我白天沒做完的工作我在晚上時會在家裡彌補過來，", "en": "Every day, I cried all the way to workand all the way home again. I promised my boss that the workI didn't get done during the day, I'd make up at night from home."}, {"zh-tw": "我猜我無法做到只是我自己有問題」。所以這些就是媽媽們的情形，那小寶貝們又如何呢？以一個國家而言我們關心每年職場媽媽所生出來的數百萬名小寶貝們嗎？我想我們並沒有的，除非等到他們到工作、繳稅、從軍的年紀。", "en": "I thought, there's just somethingwrong with me that I can't swing this.\" So those are the mothers. What of the babies? As a country, do we careabout the millions of babies born every year to working mothers? I say we don't, not until they're of workingand tax-paying and military-serving age."}, {"zh-tw": "我們跟他們說十八年後再見，而要到那時候像是他們自己的事了！其中一個我所知道的原因是那些能有十二個或是更多禮拜時間在家陪小寶貝的媽媽們是更有可能在寶貝第一年的人生提供疫苗注射以及良好的照顧，所以那些小寶貝們是更受到保護免於致命和失能的疾病，", "en": "We tell them we'll see them in 18 years, and getting there is kind of on them. One of the reasons I know thisis that babies whose mothers have 12 or more weeks at home with them are more likely to get their vaccinationsand their well checks in their first year, so those babies are more protectedfrom deadly and disabling diseases."}, {"zh-tw": "但事情都被像這樣的景象給隱藏住了。美國要給在上班的新手媽媽和他們的小寶貝們一個訊息：", "en": "But those things are hiddenbehind images like this. America has a message for new motherswho work and for their babies."}, {"zh-tw": "不管是在什麼時候你們聚首了你們應該為此感恩，而你們對經濟還有雇主來說是種拖累。我所聽到的很多故事穿插了感激之情", "en": "Whatever time you get together,you should be grateful for it, and you're an inconvenience to the economy and to your employers. That narrative of gratituderuns through a lot of the stories I hear."}, {"zh-tw": "一名婦女告訴我：「我在剖腹生產八週後復職，因為我老公失業了！少了我我女兒就活不下去了－", "en": "A woman told me, \"I went back at eight weeksafter my C-section because my husband was out of work. Without me, my daughterhad failure to thrive."}, {"zh-tw": "她一瓶奶水也不會喝，她開始不斷瘦下來。", "en": "She wouldn't take a bottle. She started losing weight."}, {"zh-tw": "好在我的經理非常諒解我，他讓我母親帶來我的小寶貝，她帶著氧氣罩和監測器，一輪工時裡可有四次機會，讓我可以護理她。」世界上有著一小團體的國家沒有給新手媽媽們國有帶薪假，", "en": "Thankfully, my managerwas very understanding. He let my mom bring my baby, who was on oxygen and a monitor, four times a shift so I could nurse her.\" There's a little clubof countries in the world that offer no nationalpaid leave to new mothers."}, {"zh-tw": "用心猜一下是哪些國家呢？前八名構成八百萬的總人口數－有著巴布紐幾內亞、蘇利南、以及小島島國密克羅尼西亞、馬紹爾、諾魯、紐埃、帛琉和東加，", "en": "Care to guess who they are? The first eight make up eight millionin total population.

Oh, that's it."}, {"zh-tw": "那就是這份名單最後的部份。地球上每一個其他的經濟體都幫為國家之長久做出貢獻的這些人找到方法訂出某些程度的國有帶薪假。而我們卻是說：「我們沒有可能做到、經濟市場將會解決這個問題」，後來當公司給出更多帶薪假給早已是我們裡面最高學歷、薪水的婦女時我們大聲叫好；", "en": "That's the end of the list. Every other economy on the planet has found a way to make some levelof national paid leave work for the people doing the workof the future of those countries, but we say,\"We couldn't possibly do that.\" We say that the marketwill solve this problem, and then we cheer when corporationsoffer even more paid leave to the women who are already the highest-educatedand highest-paid among us."}, {"zh-tw": "還記得 88 ％嗎？那些中、低所得婦女將分不到一杯羹。我們知道這辦法有驚人的經濟、財務、人身上、情感上的成本，", "en": "Remember that 88 percent? Those middle- and low-income womenare not going to participate in that. We know that there are staggeringeconomic, financial, physical and emotional costs to this approach."}, {"zh-tw": "我們已經決定好而不是意外－把這些成本都直接過讓給職場媽媽以及她們的小寶貝們，我們知道對低所得婦女來說代價是更加高昂的，因此對有膚色的婦女來說更是有失公允，", "en": "We have decided --decided, not an accident, to pass these costs directlyon to working mothers and their babies. We know the price tag is higherfor low-income women, therefore disproportionatelyfor women of color."}, {"zh-tw": "總之我們過讓了這些成本！這所有一切變成美國丟臉的事情，", "en": "We pass them on anyway. All of this is to America's shame."}, {"zh-tw": "不過也成了美國的隱憂；又會發生什麼事呢－要是這些俗稱「選擇有孩子的人」開始全都變成選擇不要有孩子的人。", "en": "But it's also to America's risk.
