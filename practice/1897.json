Except in this game,that combination of skill, talent and luck that helped earn you successin games, as in life, has been rendered irrelevant, because this game's been rigged, and you've got the upper hand."}, {"zh-tw": "你更有錢比別人更多移動的機會更能接觸資源當你這麼想像時也請自問在這被動手腳的遊戲中作為佔上風的玩家會如何改變對自己和其他玩家的看法呢？我們在加州柏克萊大學研究這個問題", "en": "You've got more money, more opportunities to movearound the board, and more access to resources. And as you think about that experience, I want you to ask yourself: How might that experience of beinga privileged player in a rigged game change the way you think about yourself and regard that other player? So, we ran a studyon the UC Berkeley campus to look at exactly that question."}, {"zh-tw": "我們帶100對以上的陌生人到研究室用擲硬幣的方式隨機分配兩人中的一人當富有的玩家富玩家領的錢會多兩倍每經過起點就會多領一倍的薪水還能一次擲兩個骰子所以更有機會多走幾圈", "en": "We brought in more than 100 pairsof strangers into the lab, and with the flip of a coin, randomly assigned one of the twoto be a rich player in a rigged game. They got two times as much money; when they passed Go,they collected twice the salary; and they got to rollboth dice instead of one, so they got to movearound the board a lot more."}, {"zh-tw": "我們便在這15分鐘內從隱藏相機觀察他們今日是我們首次公布我們觀察的成果", "en": "And over the course of 15 minutes, we watched throughhidden cameras what happened. What I want to do today,for the first time, is show you a little bit of what we saw."}, {"zh-tw": "若音質不太好請予見諒畢竟這些都來自隱蔽鏡頭大家可以讀字幕", "en": "You'll to have to pardonthe sound quality, because again, these were hidden cameras. So we've provided subtitles."}, {"zh-tw": "富玩家：嘿，你有多少張 500元？窮玩家：就一張富玩家：開玩笑的吧?!窮玩家：是啊富玩家：我有三張", "en": "[Video] Rich Player: How many500s did you have? Poor Player: Just one. RP: Are you serious?PP: Yeah."}, {"zh-tw": "真不知他們幹嘛給我這麼多講員：好，玩家很快就注意到有些事情不太對勁", "en": "RP: I have three. (Laughs)I don't know why they gave me so much. Paul Piff: So it was quickly apparentto players that something was up."}, {"zh-tw": "其中一位很明顯比另一位更有錢但當遊戲繼續時我們看到既顯著又巨大的差異在兩位玩家之間出現富玩家移動跳棋的聲音變大根本就是邊跳棋", "en": "One person clearly hasa lot more money than the other person, and yet, as the game unfolded, we saw very notable differences,dramatic differences begin to emerge between the two players. The rich player started to movearound the board louder, literally smacking the boardwith the piece as he went around."}, {"zh-tw": "邊砸紙板我們開始看到宣示主權的樣子和非語言表達都在展現勢力和富玩家互相慶祝我們有碗椒鹽脆餅放在一旁", "en": "(Game piece smacks board) We were more likelyto see signs of dominance and nonverbal signs, displays of power and celebration among the rich players. We had a bowl of pretzelspositioned off to the side."}, {"zh-tw": "就在那右下角這讓我們得以觀察參與者的胃口", "en": "It's on the bottom right corner. That allowed us to watchparticipants' consummatory behavior."}, {"zh-tw": "然後單純追蹤他們吃了多少脆餅富玩家：這些脆餅有什詭計嗎?窮玩家：不知", "en": "So we're just trackinghow many pretzels participants eat. [Video] RP: Are those pretzels a trick? PP: I don't know."}, {"zh-tw": "講者：可想而知，他們開始懷疑我們了他們懷疑那碗脆餅為什麼一開始就在那", "en": "Paul Piff: OK, so no surprises,people are on to us. They wonder what that bowl of pretzelsis doing there in the first place."}, {"zh-tw": "就像你剛看到的一位甚至問那碗脆餅放在那是否藏有詭計即便如此，主權似乎仍不可避免的開始展現出來那些富玩家開始吃更多的脆餅了富玩家: 我愛～椒鹽脆餅", "en": "One even asks, like you just saw, \"Is that bowl of pretzelsthere as a trick?\" And yet, despite that,the power of the situation seems to inevitably dominate, and those rich playersstart to eat more pretzels. [Video] RP: I love pretzels."}, {"zh-tw": "講員: 遊戲持續時我們觀察出一種有趣又戲劇化的既定模式富玩家開始對另一位玩家更粗魯對於這些窮玩家可憐的處境顯得越來越沒同理心也越來越愛誇炫自己物質上的豐碩更愛現他們有多成功富玩家: 我樣樣不缺錢", "en": "Paul Piff: And as the game went on, one of the really interestingand dramatic patterns that we observed begin to emerge was that the rich playersactually started to become ruder toward the other person -- less and less sensitive to the plightof those poor, poor players, and more and more demonstrativeof their material success, more likely to showcasehow well they're doing. [Video] RP: I have money ..."}, {"zh-tw": "窮玩家: 那有多少?富玩家:你欠我24美元", "en": "(Laughs) I have money for everything. PP: How much is that? RP: You owe me 24 dollars."}, {"zh-tw": "你快傾家蕩產了我買。反正我有的是錢。", "en": "You're going to lose all your money soon. I'll buy it.

I'm pretty much untouchable at this point."}, {"zh-tw": "這是我覺得特別特別有趣的地方在15分鐘的遊戲結束後我們詢問玩家在這遊戲中取得的經驗當富玩家談到為何他們最終贏了這場我們動過手腳的大富翁遊戲", "en": "Paul Piff: And here's what I thinkwas really, really interesting: it's that, at the end of the 15 minutes, we asked the players to talkabout their experience during the game. And when the rich players talkedabout why they had inevitably won in this rigged game of Monopoly ..."}, {"zh-tw": "他們高闊談論費了多少力才買下各種資產然後獲得成功對於遊戲過程中感到怪異的也變得無感包括以擲硬幣的方式隨機讓他們雀屏中選在遊戲一開始就取得優勢", "en": "They talked about what they'd doneto buy those different properties and earn their success in the game. And they became far less attuned to all those differentfeatures of the situation -- including that flip of a coin -- that had randomly gotten theminto that privileged position in the first place."}, {"zh-tw": "這給予我們很棒的機會洞察人的心理如何對優勢作出合理的解釋這場大富翁遊戲影射整個社會幫助我們了解社會的階級體制有些人擁有許多財富和身分地位多數人卻沒有他們過的較拮据 沒有社會地位也較難取得有用資源", "en": "And that's a really,really incredible insight into how the mindmakes sense of advantage. Now, this game of Monopoly can be used as a metaphor for understanding societyand its hierarchical structure, wherein some peoplehave a lot of wealth and a lot of status, and a lot of people don't; they have a lot less wealthand a lot less status and a lot less access to valued resources."}, {"zh-tw": "過去7年我與同事一起研究這些階級體制帶來的影響我們從各地數千名參與者身上得出的結論是個人財富比例越高憐憫心和同理心都會同時降低對於頭銜的慾望，享有應得的和自身利益相關的意識都會增加", "en": "And what my colleagues and Ifor the last seven years have been doing is studying the effectsof these kinds of hierarchies. What we've been findingacross dozens of studies and thousands of participantsacross this country is that as a person's levelsof wealth increase, their feelings of compassionand empathy go down, and their feelings of entitlement,of deservingness, and their ideologyof self-interest increase."}, {"zh-tw": "我們在調查中發現較富有的人更容易把貪婪道德化而追求自身利益也被當做是道德的今天我想談談追求自身利益暗示著甚麼談我們為何應該關注這些事以及相關對策", "en": "In surveys, we've found that it's actually wealthier individualswho are more likely to moralize greed being good, and that the pursuit of self-interestis favorable and moral. Now, what I want to do todayis talk about some of the implications of this ideology self-interest, talk about why we shouldcare about those implications, and end with what might be done."}, {"zh-tw": "我們在這個領域裡首先做的研究是那些互助行為社會學家稱作為「利社會行為」我們對誰更會對別人施以援手更感興趣是富人還是窮人呢?在某項研究裡 我們邀社區裡的富人和窮人到實驗室給每位10美元", "en": "Some of the first studiesthat we ran in this area looked at helping behavior, something social psychologistscall \"pro-social behavior.\" And we were really interested in who's more likelyto offer help to another person: someone who's rich or someone who's poor. In one of the studies, we bring rich and poor membersof the community into the lab, and give each of themthe equivalent of 10 dollars."}, {"zh-tw": "我們告訴參與者他們可選擇保留這10美元或與人分享一部分若他們想要也可贈予完全不認識的陌生人而且雙方以後都不會再遇到", "en": "We told the participants they could keepthese 10 dollars for themselves, or they could sharea portion of it, if they wanted to, with a stranger, who's totally anonymous. They'll never meet that stranger;the stranger will never meet them."}, {"zh-tw": "接著很單純的監視人們會給多少一年賺2萬5或低於1萬5的參與者更願意贈與44%自己的錢給陌生人而一年賺15萬", "en": "And we just monitor how much people give. Individuals who made 25,000,sometimes under 15,000 dollars a year, gave 44 percent moreof their money to the stranger than did individuals making150,000, 200,000 dollars a year."}, {"zh-tw": "或20萬的人卻不太會我們讓參與者玩遊戲藉此看出誰更容易作弊增加贏得獎金的機會其中我們對一台電腦作了手腳讓骰子難以出現特定的數字這遊戲無法讓你得超過12點", "en": "We've had people play games to see who's more or less likely to cheat to increase their chancesof winning a prize. In one of the games,we actually rigged a computer so that die rolls over a certain scorewere impossible -- You couldn't get above 12in this game, and yet ..."}, {"zh-tw": "然而你越富有就越有可能作弊以便獲得近50美元的獎金有時甚至有3、4倍之多我們所做的另一項研究是告訴參與者是否會拿糖果罐裡的糖果我們清楚的告訴他們那罐糖果是要留給小孩吃的我是說真的我知道這聽起來很可笑", "en": "the richer you were, the more likelyyou were to cheat in this game to earn credits toward a $50 cash prize -- sometimes by three to four times as much. We ran another study where we looked at whether peoplewould be inclined to take candy from a jar of candythat we explicitly identified as being reserved for children -- I'm not kidding -- I know it soundslike I'm making a joke."}, {"zh-tw": "但我們很清楚的告知參與者那一罐糖果是要給在附近研究室裡的小孩吃的他們就在研究室裡這是要給他們的然後我們監控參與者吃了多少糖果", "en": "We explicitly told participants: \"This candy is for children participatingin a developmental lab nearby. They're in studies. This is for them.\" And we just monitoredhow much candy participants took."}, {"zh-tw": "感到富有的參與者比感到窮的參與者多吃兩倍的糖果我們甚至研究車輛", "en": "Participants who felt richtook two times as much candy as participants who felt poor. We've even studied cars."}, {"zh-tw": "不只是任何車輛而是不同車款的車主是否更傾向於犯法其中一項研究裡 我們察看駕駛員是否會為行人停下來這些要過馬路的人都是我們請的", "en": "Not just any cars, but whether driversof different kinds of cars are more or less inclinedto break the law. In one of these studies, we looked at whether driverswould stop for a pedestrian that we had posed waitingto cross at a crosswalk."}, {"zh-tw": "在加州 我確信你們都知道因為我們都做過法律明規路人要過馬路時需停車這是大家平常的做法", "en": "Now in California, as you all know, because I'm sure we all do this, it's the law to stop for a pedestrianwho's waiting to cross. So here's an example of how we did it."}, {"zh-tw": "左邊是我們的人裝作要過馬路他在紅色卡車成功停下時過馬路", "en": "That's our confederate off to the left,posing as a pedestrian. He approaches as the red trucksuccessfully stops."}, {"zh-tw": "在加州也很常見公車像是沒看到路人直接開過去這是另一個較為昂貴的轎車豐田普銳斯和BMW的做法一樣", "en": "In typical California fashion, it's overtaken by the buswho almost runs our pedestrian over. Now here's an exampleof a more expensive car, a Prius, driving through,and a BMW doing the same."}, {"zh-tw": "我們花了好幾天研究了幾百輛車追蹤誰會和誰不會為路人停我們發現越貴的車裡", "en": "So we did this for hundreds of vehicles on several days, just tracking who stops and who doesn't. What we found was as the expensivenessof a car increased ..."}, {"zh-tw": "坐的駕駛員就越傾向於犯法在那些最便宜的車款中沒有任何一輛，沒有任何一輛觸法。", "en": "the drivers' tendenciesto break the law increased as well. None of the cars -- none of the cars -- in our least expensive car category broke the law."}, {"zh-tw": "而近乎5成的汽車在我們最昂貴的車款項目裡都犯法我們在別的研究裡也發現更富有的人在協商時更容易說謊或在工作上做出沒道德的事像是從收銀機裡偷錢接受賄路，欺騙顧客", "en": "Close to 50 percent of the carsin our most expensive vehicle category broke the law. We've run other studies, finding that wealthier individualsare more likely to lie in negotiations, to endorse unethical behavior at work, like stealing cash from the cash register, taking bribes, lying to customers."}, {"zh-tw": "我不是要說只有富人才會有這類的行為不是的 我想我們大家在每日每分的生活裡都得跟這些動機交戰好幾回像是何時放下個人的利益把他人的利益擺在前面", "en": "Now, I don't mean to suggest that it's only wealthy peoplewho show these patterns of behavior. Not at all -- in fact,I think that we all, in our day-to-day, minute-by-minute lives, struggle with these competing motivations of when or if to put our own interestsabove the interests of other people."}, {"zh-tw": "這種掙扎在所難免因為美國夢的思維是人人都有平等的機會成功、發達只要我們認真努力打拼那就意味著有時我們的自身利益得放在別人的利益和福利前面", "en": "And that's understandable, because the American dream is an idea in which we all have an equal opportunityto succeed and prosper, as long as we applyourselves and work hard. And a piece of that means that sometimes, you need to put your own interests above the interests and well-beingof other people around you."}, {"zh-tw": "但我們也研究出越富有的人越能想像個人成功的樣子其成就和豐功偉業甚至不惜損及周遭的人這裡是每5分之1的人口和前5%人口的平均家庭收入這資料匯集超過20年", "en": "But what we're findingis that the wealthier you are, the more likely you are to pursuea vision of personal success, of achievement and accomplishment, to the detriment of others around you. Here I've plotted for youthe mean household income received by each fifthand top five percent of the population over the last 20 years."}, {"zh-tw": "1993年 其差異在每5分之1人口的薪水上就相當的糟要分辨出其差異很簡單", "en": "In 1993, the differences between the differentquintiles of the population, in terms of income, are fairly egregious. It's not difficult to discernthat there are differences."}, {"zh-tw": "但過去20年 其差異變得像大峽谷一樣淵長夾在頂端和普遍人口之間人口頂端的2成就擁有這國家近9成的財富", "en": "But over the last 20 years,that significant difference has become a Grand Canyon of sorts between those at the topand everyone else. In fact, the top 20 percentof our population own close to 90 percentof the total wealth in this country."}, {"zh-tw": "我們已到前所未見的經濟失衡這意味著財富不只逐漸集中在少數特定人口的手上但取得美國夢對大多數的我們也顯得難上加難", "en": "We're at unprecedented levelsof economic inequality. What that means is that wealth is not onlybecoming increasingly concentrated in the hands of a select groupof individuals, but the American dreamis becoming increasingly unattainable for an increasing majority of us."}, {"zh-tw": "若這是問題的癥結也就是你越富有就越覺得應得那份財富也就更傾向自己的利益優先再來才會輪到別人的然後竭盡心力的維護自身利益這樣的情況下其差異當然不會縮小反而給足理由認定情況只會越來越糟若情況沒改善的話接下來的20年情況也不會好轉", "en": "And if it's the case,as we've been finding, that the wealthier you are, the more entitled you feel to that wealth, and the more likely you areto prioritize your own interests above the interests of other people, and be willing to do thingsto serve that self-interest, well, then, there's no reason to thinkthat those patterns will change. In fact, there's every reasonto think that they'll only get worse, and that's what it would look likeif things just stayed the same, at the same linear rate,over the next 20 years."}, {"zh-tw": "我們全部人，都應該關心經濟的分配不均而不只限於社會底層的人因為在分配不均的經濟情況裡個人和團體都過的更不好不只是社會底層 大家也都蒙受其害", "en": "Now inequality -- economic inequality -- is something we shouldall be concerned about, and not just because of thoseat the bottom of the social hierarchy, but because individuals and groups with lots of economicinequality do worse ... not just the peopleat the bottom, everyone."}, {"zh-tw": "有份可信度十分高的研究來自世界各地頂尖的實驗室證實社會問題隨著經濟失衡變本加厲也會隨之變得更嚴重像是社會流動和我們很在乎的如健康，社會互信等方面全都會隨著不平等的增長降低", "en": "There's a lot of reallycompelling research coming out from top labsall over the world, showcasing the range of thingsthat are undermined as economic inequality gets worse. Social mobility,things we really care about, physical health, social trust, all go down as inequality goes up."}, {"zh-tw": "依此類推社會和其群體性的負面如過胖，暴力關押，處罰也會隨之遽增這些不良的後果不是只有少數的有所體會而是橫跨社會各個階級", "en": "Similarly, negative thingsin social collectives and societies, things like obesity, and violence, imprisonment, and punishment, are exacerbated as economicinequality increases. Again, these are outcomesnot just experienced by a few, but that resoundacross all strata of society."}, {"zh-tw": "甚至那些身處高位的人也會有經歷這些後果那我們該作些什麼呢?這一連串壞的影響正自運轉著隨時都會失控而我們卻束手無策以個人的力量當然沒辦法解決", "en": "Even people at the topexperience these outcomes. So what do we do? This cascade of self-perpetuating, pernicious, negative effects could seem like somethingthat's spun out of control, and there's nothing we can do about it, certainly nothingwe as individuals could do."}, {"zh-tw": "但我們實際上卻在自己的研究室發現只要在心理上作少許的干預在價值觀上作些小改變微微轉移他們的注意力便能重新回到正常的平等主義和同理心例如，提醒人們團結的力量或社區可帶來的益處讓富人也可變得跟窮人一樣的愛平等", "en": "But in fact, we've been findingin our own laboratory research that small psychological interventions, small changes to people's values, small nudges in certain directions, can restore levelsof egalitarianism and empathy. For instance, reminding peopleof the benefits of cooperation or the advantages of community, cause wealthier individualsto be just as egalitarian as poor people."}, {"zh-tw": "一項研究邀參與者看僅46秒有關家境貧困的簡短影片用意在於提醒他們別人的需要看了那片子後我們觀察人們會變得有多願意用自己的時間去幫助在研究室裡苦惱的陌生人", "en": "In one study, we had people watcha brief video, just 46 seconds long, about childhood poverty that served as a reminder of the needsof others in the world around them. And after watching that, we looked at how willing peoplewere to offer up their own time to a stranger presented to themin the lab, who was in distress."}, {"zh-tw": "一小時後看那片子的富人變得一樣大方願意奉獻自己的時間去幫助別人一位陌生人或貧困的人這些研究顯示差異並不是與生俱來的或侷限在你來自哪個社會階層這是可改變得稍微改變人們的價值觀輕輕提醒他們該更有憐憫心更富有同理心橫越過我們實驗室牆外我們甚至開始看到社會改變的跡象", "en": "After watching this video, an hour later, rich people becamejust as generous of their own time to help out this other person, a stranger, as someone who's poor, suggesting that these differencesare not innate or categorical, but are so malleableto slight changes in people's values, and little nudges of compassionand bumps of empathy. And beyond the walls of our lab, we're even beginning to seesigns of change in society."}, {"zh-tw": "比爾•蓋茲，我國最富有的人之一在哈佛畢業典禮的演講中他談到社會問題解決不平等的現象是艱困的挑戰也談到該做什麼來打擊問題他說: 「 ...人類最大的進步並不是來自於這些發現 —而是在於那些被用來減少不平等的創見。」(取自Morton's Weblog)還有「捐贈誓言」我國超過100位的富豪都發誓簽署捐贈他們一半的資產給慈善機構還有許多民間運動逐漸匯集像「我們是那1%的人口」「資源世代」(自譯:吳貞慧)「普及財富」(自譯)也就是人口中擁有許多特權的人人口頂尖的1%等以及富豪都在運用自己的經濟資源不管是成年人或青少年－　最讓我驚喜的都在運用自身的優勢和經濟資源對抗不平等藉由擁護社會方針改善社會價值觀改善人們的行為即便與自身利益相突但終能給予希望恢復美國夢", "en": "Bill Gates, one of our nation'swealthiest individuals, in his Harvard commencement speech, talked about the problemof inequality facing society as being the most daunting challenge, and talked about what mustbe done to combat it, saying, \"Humanity's greatest advancesare not in its discoveries -- but in how those discoveries are applied to reduce inequity.\" And there's the Giving Pledge, in which more than 100of our nation's wealthiest individuals are pledging halfof their fortunes to charity. And there's the emergence of dozensof grassroots movements, like \"We are the 1 percent,\" \"Resource Generation,\" or \"Wealth for Common Good,\" in which the most privilegedmembers of the population, members of the one percent and elsewhere, people who are wealthy, are using their own economic resources, adults and youth alike --that's what's most striking to me -- leveraging their own privilege,their own economic resources, to combat inequality by advocating for social policies, changes in social values and changes in people's behavior that work againsttheir own economic interests, but that may ultimatelyrestore the American dream."}, {"zh-tw": "謝謝", "en": "Thank you."}], "title": "Paul Piff Does Money Make You Mean"}
