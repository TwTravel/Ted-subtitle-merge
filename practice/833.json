Right after I completed my Ph.D., I was lucky enough to be included with a group of scientists that was using it for the first time as a tool for ocean exploration.", "en": " 其實它本來是設計給近海石油工業使用的 可以潛到 2,000 呎深的鑽油平台 在我拿到博士學位以後 非常幸運的加入了一群科學家的行列 那是我第一次使用它 來做海洋探險的工具"}, {"zh-tw": " We trained in a tank in Port Hueneme, and then my first open ocean dive was in Santa Barbara Channel. It was an evening dive.", "en": " 我們在休尼米港(美國海軍設施用地)受訓， 然後我第一次的海潛 是在聖塔芭芭拉海峽 那是一次的夜潛"}, {"zh-tw": " I went down to a depth of 880 feet and turned out the lights. And the reason I turned out the lights is because I knew I would see this phenomenon of animals making light called bioluminescence.", "en": " 我下到 880 呎深的水中 關掉所有燈光 我關燈的原因是因為我知道我會看到 某種生物體發光的現象 科學上稱為「生物螢光」"}, {"zh-tw": " But I was totally unprepared for how much there was and how spectacular it was. I saw chains of jellyfish called siphonophores that were longer than this room, pumping out so much light that I could read the dials and gauges inside the suit without a flashlight; and puffs and billows of what looked like luminous blue smoke; and explosions of sparks that would swirl up out of the thrusters -- just like when you throw a log on a campfire and the embers swirl up off the campfire, but these were icy, blue embers.", "en": " 但我完全沒有預料到 那數量之多 而且十分壯觀 我看到一連串稱為「管水母」的生物排成的水母鏈 比這個房間還長 發出的光之多 即使在潛水裝裡不開手電筒 我也看得到刻度跟儀表板的數字 還有一陣陣大小翻騰 看起來像藍色螢光的煙霧 或是像從推進器渦旋而出 蹦開的火花 就像你丟一塊木頭到營火裡，火花霹啪往上竄， 只不過這些是冰冷的藍色火光"}, {"zh-tw": " It was breathtaking. Now, usually if people are familiar with bioluminescence at all, it's these guys; it's fireflies.", "en": " 美到讓人窒息 如果熟悉生物螢光的人就知道， 其實就是這些傢伙，螢火蟲"}, {"zh-tw": " And there are a few other land-dwellers that can make light -- some insects, earthworms, fungi -- but in general, on land, it's really rare. In the ocean, it's the rule rather than the exception.", "en": " 有一些其他陸居的生物也會發光 像一些昆蟲，蚯蚓或真菌等等， 一般來說，在陸地上並不常見 但在海洋中，卻是生存法則， 而不是特例"}, {"zh-tw": " If I go out in the open ocean environment, virtually anywhere in the world, and I drag a net from 3,000 feet to the surface, most of the animals -- in fact, in many places, 80 to 90 percent of the animals that I bring up in that net -- make light. This makes for some pretty spectacular light shows.", "en": " 如果我到一個開放的海域， 實際上就是世界上任何地方， 然後我拖著一個網子，從 3,000 呎深拖到海面， 我捕到的東西， 事實上，在很多地方， 有八到九成， 都會發光 夜夜上演著美麗絢爛的燈光秀"}, {"zh-tw": " Now I want to share with you a little video that I shot from a submersible.

That sparkle you're seeing is not luminescence, that's just electronic noise on these super intensified cameras.", "en": " 所以打開攝影機，關掉燈光， 不過你們現在看到的火光不是生物螢光 只是在強化攝影機上的 一些電波雜訊"}, {"zh-tw": " You don't see luminescence until the submersible begins to move forward through the water, but as it does, animals bumping into the screen are stimulated to bioluminesce. Now, when I was first doing this, all I was trying to do was count the numbers of sources.", "en": " 要等到潛艇開始在水裡移動的時候 你們才會看到生物螢光 就是這樣，鏡頭螢幕碰到生物的時候 生物會受到刺激發出生物螢光 我剛開始試的時候 我一直在計算發光體的數目"}, {"zh-tw": " I knew my forward speed, I knew the area, and so I could figure out how many hundreds of sources there were per cubic meter.

So, how does a living creature make light? Well, that was the question that 19th century French physiologist Raphael Dubois, asked about this bioluminescent clam.", "en": " 所以如果你狂歡到半夜 突然覺得很尿急 衝到廁所的時候忘了開燈 你可能會以為你看到了神蹟 那麼，生物是如何發光的呢？ 這個問題在十九世紀的時候被提出 一個法國的生理學家 Raphael Dubois 對生物螢光蚌有些疑問"}, {"zh-tw": " He ground it up and he managed to get out a couple of chemicals; one, the enzyme, he called luciferase; the substrate, he called luciferin after Lucifer the Lightbearer. That terminology has stuck, but it doesn't actually refer to specific chemicals because these chemicals come in a lot of different shapes and forms.", "en": " 他把這些蛤磨碎，想從中得到一些化學物質 有一種他稱作「螢光基因」的酵素 還有其它基質，他稱做「螢光素」 取自 Lucifer (上帝製造的第一個天使) 意為光明的持有者 這些術語沿用至今 但因為這些化學物質種類眾多且形態各異 所以它們並不代表特定的化學物質"}, {"zh-tw": " In fact, most of the people studying bioluminescence today are focused on the chemistry, because these chemicals have proved so incredibly valuable for developing antibacterial agents, cancer fighting drugs, testing for the presence of life on Mars, detecting pollutants in our waters -- which is how we use it at ORCA. In 2008, the Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded for work done on a molecule called green fluorescent protein that was isolated from the bioluminescent chemistry of a jellyfish, and it's been equated to the invention of the microscope, in terms of the impact that it has had on cell biology and genetic engineering.", "en": " 事實上 大多數現在研究生物螢光的人 都把重點放在化學性質上 因為這些化合物已被證實極具價值 可以拿來生產抗生素 抗癌藥物 測試火星上的生命跡象 偵測我們飲用水裡的污染物 也就是我們在 ORCA 裡用的 2008年的 諾貝爾化學獎 就頒給了 綠色螢光蛋白（GFP）的分子研究 此種分子正是從水母的生物螢光物質中 分離出來的 以其在細胞生物 和基因工程上的影響來說 跟顯微鏡的發明有著同等的地位"}, {"zh-tw": " Another thing all these molecules are telling us that, apparently, bioluminescence has evolved at least 40 times, maybe as many as 50 separate times in evolutionary history, which is a clear indication of how spectacularly important this trait is for survival. So, what is it about bioluminescence that's so important to so many animals? Well, for animals that are trying to avoid predators by staying in the darkness, light can still be very useful for the three basic things that animals have to do to survive: and that's find food, attract a mate and avoid being eaten.", "en": " 這些微小分子告訴我們的另一件事是 很顯然的，生物螢光在演化史上 已經演化了至少 40 次 甚至 50 次之多 這個特質很清楚的顯示 適者生存 在演化上的重要性 那麼，生物螢光對於這麼多生物來說 到底有多重要？ 可以這樣說，生物要避免掠食者， 可以隱身於黑暗之中， 但光在三個基本需求上 是生存必備的法寶 也就是「覓食」、 「尋找伴侶」、以及「躲避掠食者」"}, {"zh-tw": " So, for example, this fish has a built-in headlight behind its eye that it can use for finding food or attracting a mate. And then when it's not using it, it actually can roll it down into its head just like the headlights on your Lamborghini.", "en": " 舉例來說，這種魚 的眼睛上方有個內建式的頭燈（發光器） 可以用來覓食 或是吸引異性 如果不用的時候，也可以捲進頭部， 就像藍寶基尼跑車的車頭燈"}, {"zh-tw": " This fish actually has high beams. And this fish, which is one of my favorites, has three headlights on each side of its head.", "en": " 再看這條魚，甚至還有遠燈 這隻，是我最愛的魚之一 在頭上三側各有三個頭燈的魚"}, {"zh-tw": " Now, this one is blue, and that's the color of most bioluminescence in the ocean because evolution has selected for the color that travels farthest through seawater in order to optimize communication. So, most animals make blue light, and most animals can only see blue light, but this fish is a really fascinating exception because it has two red light organs.", "en": " 現在看到的這個燈是藍色的 也是生物螢光在海洋中最常見的顏色 因為演化的過程中 為了達到最有效的效率 選擇了在海水中穿透能力最強的藍光 所以多數生物發出藍色光 或是只能看見藍色光 但這種魚實在是一個美麗的例外 因為牠有兩個發紅光的器官"}, {"zh-tw": " And I have no idea why there's two, and that's something I want to solve some day -- but not only can it see blue light, but it can see red light. So it uses its red bioluminescence like a sniper's scope to be able to sneak up on animals that are blind to red light and be able to see them without being seen.", "en": " 我不知道為什麼要有兩個 希望有朝一日我能解答 所以牠不只能看到藍光 也能看到紅光 牠的紅色生物螢光就像狙擊手的瞄準鏡 讓牠能偷偷摸摸地接近 那些看不見紅光的獵物 就像隱形一樣"}, {"zh-tw": " It's also got a little chin barbel here with a blue luminescent lure on it that it can use to attract prey from a long way off. And a lot of animals will use their bioluminescence as a lure.", "en": " 在下巴這裡也有一個 是用藍色螢光當成誘餌 可以用來吸引比較遠的獵物 很多生物都會把生物螢光當成誘餌"}, {"zh-tw": " This is another one of my favorite fish. This is a viperfish, and it's got a lure on the end of a long fishing rod that it arches in front of the toothy jaw that gives the viperfish its name.", "en": " 這是另一種我最愛的魚 毒蛇魚 在牠長長背鰭的尾端有個誘餌 在齒狀的下顎上拱起 毒蛇魚因此得名"}, {"zh-tw": " The teeth on this fish are so long that if they closed inside the mouth of the fish, it would actually impale its own brain. So instead, it slides in grooves on the outside of the head.", "en": " 這種魚的牙齒很長 長到如果牠們在魚的嘴巴裡合起來 就會刺穿到自己的腦袋裡 所以這些牙齒 是在頭部外面的齒槽上滑動"}, {"zh-tw": " This is a Christmas tree of a fish; everything on this fish lights up, it's not just that lure. It's got a built-in flashlight.", "en": " 這是魚類中的聖誕樹 它身上的每個地方都是亮的 不只是發光的誘餌 還長了個手電筒"}, {"zh-tw": " It's got these jewel-like light organs on its belly that it uses for a type of camouflage that obliterates its shadow, so when it's swimming around and there's a predator looking up from below, it makes itself disappear.

So, she's got a lure that she sticks out in front of this living mousetrap of needle-sharp teeth in order to attract in some unsuspecting prey.", "en": " 這才是活體鮟鱇魚的眼睛 上面有突起的誘餌 活像一個 佈滿針尖牙齒的捕鼠器 為了吸引一些意料之外的獵物"}, {"zh-tw": " And this one has a lure with all kinds of little interesting threads coming off it. Now we used to think that the different shape of the lure was to attract different types of prey, but then stomach content analyses on these fish done by scientists, or more likely their graduate students, have revealed that they all eat pretty much the same thing.", "en": " 這條魚的誘餌 是從這裡面穿出來的針 很有趣 我們通常會想 這些不同形式的誘餌 是用來吸引不同類型的獵物 但是科學家 或是說他們的研究生 對這些魚的胃內容物進行分析 卻發現了 他們吃的東西幾乎大同小異"}, {"zh-tw": " So, now we believe that the different shape of the lure is how the male recognizes the female in the anglerfish world, because many of these males are what are known as dwarf males.

And based on this, I went back to the National Science Foundation and said, \"This is what we will discover.\" And they gave me enough money to do it right, which has involved developing the world's first deep-sea webcam -- which has been installed in the Monterey Canyon for the past year -- and now, more recently, a modular form of this system, a much more mobile form that's a lot easier to launch and recover, that I hope can be used on Sylvia's \"hope spots\" to help explore and protect these areas, and, for me, learn more about the bioluminescence in these \"hope spots.\" So one of these take-home messages here is, there is still a lot to explore in the oceans.", "en": " 我找不到更好的方法足以驗證我的研究概念 所以有了這個，我回到國家科學基金會 告訴他們：『這就是我們發現的。』 然後他們就給了我足夠的錢繼續做下去 其中包括過去幾年被設置在蒙特里海底峽谷 這個世界第一架的 深海網路攝影機 現在，也就是最近 有了比這個攝影機 活動更為靈活的模型 同時也比較容易發動和回復 我希望能運用在Sylvia(海洋學家)所說的「夢想地」上 來探索 和保護這些區域 並且對我而言 在這些「夢想地」學到更多關於生物螢光的事 而我想給你們的其中一個訊息是 大海還有很多值得探險的地方"}, {"zh-tw": " And Sylvia has said that we are destroying the oceans before we even know what's in them, and she's right.
