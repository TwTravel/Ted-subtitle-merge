Where would you start? Well, you'd start by finding out if the biotech is really there. I started with my wife, Ryan Phelan, who ran a biotech business called DNA Direct, and through her, one of her colleagues, George Church, one of the leading genetic engineers who turned out to be also obsessed with passenger pigeons and a lot of confidence that methodologies he was working on might actually do the deed.", "en": " 如果你發現利用博物館標本 或是 20 萬年前化石中的 DNA 可以讓這些物種復活 你會怎麼做呢？ 你又會從何做起？ 你可能會先確定，生物技術是否達得到要求 我則是從我太太萊恩．費倫那開始 她經營一家叫 DNA Direct 的生技公司 透過她，我認識了她同事喬治．邱奇 他也是位著迷於旅鴿的 頂尖基因工程師 他對他所使用的方法深具信心 他對他所使用的方法深具信心 並認為他可以讓物種復活"}, {"zh-tw": " So he and Ryan organized and hosted a meeting at the Wyss Institute in Harvard bringing together specialists on passenger pigeons, conservation ornithologists, bioethicists, and fortunately passenger pigeon DNA had already been sequenced by a molecular biologist named Beth Shapiro.

Well that's what happens in normal hybridization anyway.", "en": " （譯注：這是用來解決原始基因序列上破碎、缺失的問題） 這在正常的精卵結合過程中也會發生"}, {"zh-tw": " So this is a form of synthetic hybridization of the genome of an extinct species with the genome of its closest living relative.

But it should be be perfect enough, because nature doesn't do perfect either.", "en": " 將這些都加在一起，結果不會是完美的 但應該就近乎完美了 自然界中也沒有「完美」的作品"}, {"zh-tw": " So this meeting in Boston led to three things. First off, Ryan and I decided to create a nonprofit called Revive and Restore that would push de-extinction generally and try to have it go in a responsible way, and we would push ahead with the passenger pigeon.", "en": " 所以，在波士頓的會議中決定了三件事 首先，我和萊恩創立了個非營利組織 這個名為「復活與保存」的組織致力 以付責任的方式推動「反滅絕」 而我們將先從旅鴿做起"}, {"zh-tw": " Another direct result was a young grad student named Ben Novak, who had been obsessed with passenger pigeons since he was 14 and had also learned how to work with ancient DNA, himself sequenced the passenger pigeon, using money from his family and friends. We hired him full-time.", "en": " 另一項結果是本．諾瓦克，一位年輕研究生 他從 14 歲起就被旅鴿所深深著迷 而且在學會如何操作原始 DNA 後 他利用家人和朋友的金援 完成了旅鴿基因體定序 我們雇用了他"}, {"zh-tw": " Now, this photograph I took of him last year at the Smithsonian, he's looking down at Martha, the last passenger pigeon alive.

And National Geographic got interested because National Geographic has the theory that the last century, discovery was basically finding things, and in this century, discovery is basically making things.", "en": " 波士頓會議的第三項結果是 讓我們瞭解到世界上有許多科學家 在進行不同型式的反滅絕 但他們素未謀面 而國家地理頻道對此感到興趣 因為他們有個想法 就是上世紀的發現是為了尋找未知 而這個世紀是在創造發明"}, {"zh-tw": " De-extinction falls in that category. So they hosted and funded this meeting. And 35 scientists, they were conservation biologists and molecular biologists, basically meeting to see if they had work to do together.", "en": " 而反滅絕符合此條件 所以他們資助並主辦了這場會議 讓 35 位保育生物學家和分子生物學家 見面並討論合作機會"}, {"zh-tw": " Some of these conservation biologists are pretty radical. There's three of them who are not just re-creating ancient species, they're recreating extinct ecosystems in northern Siberia, in the Netherlands, and in Hawaii.", "en": " 其中一些保育生物學家非常激進 其中三人不只要讓古生物復活 他們更希望在北西伯利亞、荷蘭和夏威夷 恢復已經消失的生態系統"}, {"zh-tw": " Henri, from the Netherlands, with a Dutch last name I won't try to pronounce, is working on the aurochs. The aurochs is the ancestor of all domestic cattle, and so basically its genome is alive, it's just unevenly distributed.", "en": " 來自荷蘭的亨利 嗯，我不會試著說他的荷文姓氏 在做歐洲野牛 歐洲野牛是所有被馴養牛種的祖先 所以牠的基因體還存在，只是不平均的散佈在不同品種裡"}, {"zh-tw": " So what they're doing is working with seven breeds of primitive, hardy-looking cattle like that Maremmana primitivo on the top there to rebuild, over time, with selective back-breeding, the aurochs. Now, re-wilding is moving faster in Korea than it is in America, and so the plan is, with these re-wilded areas all over Europe, they will introduce the aurochs to do its old job, its old ecological role, of clearing the somewhat barren, closed-canopy forest so that it has these biodiverse meadows in it.", "en": " 所以他們利用七個原始、強韌 和上圖原牛相似的品種 利用篩選性的繁殖 希望可以讓歐洲野牛重現 現在野放在韓國推展得 比美國更為快速 所以我們計畫將野牛引進歐洲的野放區 讓牠們扮演原有的生態功能 牠們原本在生態系中扮演的角色 讓原本茂密森林下的貧脊土壤 重現多樣化的草原植被"}, {"zh-tw": " Another amazing story came from Alberto Fernández-Arias. Alberto worked with the bucardo in Spain.", "en": " 另一個令人驚歎的故事 是來自阿貝圖．費爾南斯．阿里 阿貝圖在西班牙研究布卡多山羊"}, {"zh-tw": " The last bucardo was a female named Celia who was still alive, but then they captured her, they got a little bit of tissue from her ear, they cryopreserved it in liquid nitrogen, released her back into the wild, but a few months later, she was found dead under a fallen tree.

It was short-lived.", "en": " 這是歷史上第一個反滅絕的實例 但牠活的不久"}, {"zh-tw": " Sometimes interspecies clones have respiration problems.

So now we go to Mike McGrew who is a scientist at Roslin Institute in Scotland, and Mike's doing miracles with birds.", "en": " 最讓鮑博興奮的是 現在可將任何細胞誘導成全能幹細胞 並將其分化成如精子、卵子 這類生殖細胞的技術 現在我們來介紹麥克．麥格羅 他是一位在蘇格蘭羅斯林研究所的科學家 麥克在鳥類上展現奇蹟"}, {"zh-tw": " So he'll take, say, falcon skin cells, fibroblast, turn it into induced pluripotent stem cells.

So what do you do about that? Well birds are pretty hard-wired, as it happens, so most of that is already in their DNA, but to supplement it, part of Ben's idea is to use homing pigeons to help train the young passenger pigeons how to flock and how to find their way to their old nesting grounds and feeding grounds.", "en": " 這可能會有個問題： 沒有旅鴿親鳥 如何教導乳鴿成為一隻真正的旅鴿? 你會怎麼解決這個問題？ 還好大部份鳥類行為 都包還含在牠們的 DNA 裡 但為了保險起見，他提出一個想法： 利用信鴿 教導年輕的旅鴿如何結隊飛行 並且找到原本築巢、 育幼的地方"}, {"zh-tw": " There were some conservationists, really famous conservationists like Stanley Temple, who is one of the founders of conservation biology, and Kate Jones from the IUCN, which does the Red List.
