So the reality is,is that the engine of corruption, well, it exists farbeyond the shores of countries like Equatorial Guineaor Nigeria or Turkmenistan.", "en": " 現在要講到的是最近的交易 在奈及利亞政府大方的幫忙下 我對於現在要說出的話得要非常小心 和 Shell 和 義大利 Eni 的子公司合作 這是兩家最大的石油公司 所以事實上，這是否才是貪腐的動力 這問題不光發生在那些海外國家 例如：赤道幾內亞、奈及利亞或土庫曼"}, {"zh-tw": " This engine, well, it's driven by our international banking system, by the problem of anonymousshell companies, and by the secrecy that we have afforded big oil, gas and mining operations, and, most of all, by the failureof our politicians to back up their rhetoric and do something really meaningful and systemicto tackle this stuff. Now let's take the banks first.", "en": " 驅動的動力 來自國際銀行組織 來自這些匿名的空殼公司 也來自我們賦予這些大型的石油 天然氣和礦產開採行動隱匿的權利 而最重要的，是來自政客的失職 無能實現他們的花言巧語 做些真正有意義的事且有系統的抓出這些爛帳 現在我們先談銀行問題"}, {"zh-tw": " Well, it's not goingto come as any surprise for me to tell you that banksaccept dirty money, but they prioritize their profitsin other destructive ways too. For example, in Sarawak, Malaysia.", "en": " 當我告訴你們銀行收黑錢時 我想你們不會覺得驚訝 但他們的獲利卻也造成破壞 以馬來西亞的砂勞越為例"}, {"zh-tw": " Now this region, it has just five percent of its forests left intact. Five percent. So how did that happen? Well, because an eliteand its facilitators have been making millions of dollars from supporting loggingon an industrial scale for many years.", "en": " 現在這個區域只剩下 5% 的森林未經開發 只剩下 5% 而已 這是怎麼一回事？ 就因為一個所謂菁英和主事者們 多年來 藉由支援企業規模的大量伐木 賺進了數百萬美元"}, {"zh-tw": " So we sent an undercover investigator in to secretly film meetingswith members of the ruling elite, and the resulting footage, well,it made some people very angry, and you can see that on YouTube, but it proved what we had long suspected, because it showedhow the state's chief minister, despite his later denials, used his control over landand forest licenses to enrich himself and his family. And HSBC, well, we knowthat HSBC bankrolled the region's largest logging companies that were responsiblefor some of that destruction in Sarawak and elsewhere.", "en": " 所以我們派出一個秘密調查員 錄下管理階層的的會議過程 這段影片讓某些人非常生氣 你可以在 YouTube 上找到這影片 但這證實了我們長久以來的懷疑 因為影片中顯示出這個州長 儘管他後來否認了 他利用掌控土地和森林許可證的職權 讓他自己和家族獲利 同時還有匯豐銀行 (HSBC) 就我們所知，匯豐資助當地幾家最大的伐木公司 對於這些發生在砂勞越和其他地方的破壞行為 他們也要負一部分責任"}, {"zh-tw": " The bank violated its ownsustainability policies in the process, but it earned around 130 million dollars. Now shortly after our exposé, very shortly after our exposéearlier this year, the bank announceda policy review on this.", "en": " 匯豐在這過程中違反了他們永續經營的方針 但從中賺了大約一億三千萬美金 當我們揭露這個事實之後不久 在今年稍早前揭露之後不久 匯豐宣布要以公司政策標準重審相關事宜"}, {"zh-tw": " And is this progress? Maybe, but we're going to bekeeping a very close eye on that case. And then there's the problemof anonymous shell companies.", "en": " 這算是進步嗎？　也許是 但我們還是會持續的關注 這個議題 再來是匿名空殼公司的問題"}, {"zh-tw": " Well, we've all heardabout what they are, I think, and we all know they're used quite a bit by people and companieswho are trying to avoid paying their proper dues to society, also known as taxes.

A recent study by the World Bank looked at 200 cases of corruption.", "en": " 在每個我們追查的貪腐事件中 都出現了空殼公司 有時真的無法查出 到底有哪些人牽涉其中 最近世界銀行有份研究中指出 檢視 200 件貪腐案件後"}, {"zh-tw": " It found that over 70percent of those cases had used anonymous shell companies, totaling almost 56 billion dollars. Now many of thesecompanies were in America or the United Kingdom, its overseas territoriesand Crown dependencies, and so it's not just an offshore problem, it's an on-shore one too.", "en": " 發現其中有 70% 的案例 就是使用匿名的空殼公司 牽涉的金額幾乎高達五百六十億美金 現在有許多空殼公司設在美國 或者是英國 在境外領土或是英國皇家屬地 所以這不是與我們無關的境外問題 這已經發生在我們境內"}, {"zh-tw": " You see, shell companies, they're central to the secret deals which maybenefit wealthy elites rather than ordinary citizens. One striking recent casethat we've investigated is how the governmentin the Democratic Republic of Congo sold off a series of valuable,state-owned mining assets to shell companiesin the British Virgin Islands.", "en": " 要知道，這些空殼公司是秘密交易的核心 也許少數富有的菁英份子可以從中得到好處 但一般平民是無從獲益的 最近我們調查了一個引人注目的案件 調查目標是剛果政府 如何把一系列極有價值的公家礦區賣出 賣給一間在英屬維京群島註冊的空殼公司"}, {"zh-tw": " So we spoke to sources in country, trawled through companydocuments and other information trying to piece together a reallytrue picture of the deal. And we were alarmed to findthat these shell companies had quickly flipped many of the assets on for huge profits to majorinternational mining companies listed in London.", "en": " 於是我們找了剛果的線人 搜查了所有公司文件和其他資訊 試著拼湊出這個交易的真實面貌 而後我們警覺到 這些空殼公司將資產快速地轉賣給 設立於倫敦的大型國際採礦公司 賺進了高額的利潤"}, {"zh-tw": " Now, the Africa ProgressPanel, led by Kofi Annan, they've calculatedthat Congo may have lost more than 1.3 billion dollarsfrom these deals.

Well, the answer to that question, and who was really involvedand what really happened, well that's going to probablyremain locked away in the secretive company registriesof the British Virgin Islands and elsewhere unless we all dosomething about it. And how about the oil, gasand mining companies? Okay, maybe it's a bitof a cliché to talk about them.", "en": " 而剛果人民有可能拿回他們的錢嗎？ 這問題的答案 和誰真正牽涉其中、以及事件的真相 都可能永不見天日 如果我們不針對這些註冊在英屬維京群島 或其他地方的空殼公司採取行動的話 至於那些石油、天然氣和礦產公司呢？ 好吧，這是有點老生常談"}, {"zh-tw": " Corruption in that sector, no surprise. There's corruption everywhere,so why focus on that sector? Well, because there's a lot at stake.", "en": " 在這些產業發生貪腐並不意外 到處都有貪腐，為什麼要特別關注這些產業？ 這是因為其中牽涉的利益太大"}, {"zh-tw": " In 2011, natural resource exports outweighed aid flows by almost 19 to one in Africa, Asia and Latin America.Nineteen to one.

And now forgive me, I'mgoing to read the next bit because it's a very liveissue, and our lawyers have been through this in some detail and they want me to get it right.", "en": " 現在回來談石油和採礦公司 回到 丹•埃泰特 和他十億美金的交易 現在請原諒我將要照著小抄唸 因為這是非常即時的現場演說 我們的律師查閱過一些相關條文 所以他們希望我不要有任何口誤"}, {"zh-tw": " Now, on the surface, the dealappeared straightforward. Subsidiaries of Shell and Eni paid the Nigeriangovernment for the block.", "en": " 現在，表面上這些交易看來都很單純 Shell 和 Eni 的子公司 付錢向奈及利亞政府買那個區塊"}, {"zh-tw": " The Nigerian government transferred precisely the same amount,to the very dollar, to an account earmarkedfor a shell company whose hidden owner was Etete.

After many months of digging around and reading through hundredsof pages of court documents, we found evidence that, in fact, Shell and Eni had known that the funds would be transferredto that shell company, and frankly, it's hardto believe they didn't know who they were really dealing with there.", "en": " 但現在的問題是 經過這幾個月的探查詢訪 以及研究數百頁法庭文件後 我們找到了證據 發現 Shell 和 Eni 知道 這些金錢會被轉到空殼公司 而且坦白說，很難相信他們不知道 到底是跟什麼樣的人達成這筆交易"}, {"zh-tw": " Now, it just shouldn't takethese sorts of efforts to find out where the moneyin deals like this went. I mean, these are state assets.", "en": " 而現在不應該花這些功夫 去追查這些錢跑到哪去 我認為"}, {"zh-tw": " They're supposed to beused for the benefit of the people in the country. But in some countries,citizens and journalists who are trying to expose stories like this have been harassed and arrested and some have even riskedtheir lives to do so.", "en": " 這些都是國家的資產 本來應該用來讓人民受益 但在一些國家裡 公民和記者如果想要揭露這些事 通常不是遭到恐嚇就是遭到逮捕 甚至要以生命為賭注去揭發"}, {"zh-tw": " And finally, well, thereare those who believe that corruption is unavoidable. It's just how some business is done.", "en": " 而最終，有些人深信 貪腐是無可避免 他們認為這就是做生意的方式"}, {"zh-tw": " It's too complex and difficult to change. So in effect, what? We just accept it.", "en": " 太複雜也太難去改變 所以怎麼辦呢？　我們就只能接受"}, {"zh-tw": " But as a campaigner and investigator, I have a different view, because I've seen what can happen when an idea gains momentum. In the oil and mining sector, for example, there is now the beginning of a truly worldwide transparency standard that could tackle some of these problems.", "en": " 但身為一個活動者和調查員 我有著不同的觀點 因為我曾見證過 當一個理念凝聚了氣勢之後發生的事 以石油和開礦的產業區塊為例 現在正開始進行 全球性透明化的法規 這種法規可以抓出一些弊端"}, {"zh-tw": " In 1999, when Global Witness called for oil companies to makepayments on deals transparent, well, some people laughedat the extreme naiveté of that small idea.

But we're not there yet, by far.", "en": " 這是個進展 但距離我們的目標還很遠"}, {"zh-tw": " Because it really isn't about corruption somewhere over there, is it?
