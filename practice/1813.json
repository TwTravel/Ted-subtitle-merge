I had just gone through a breakup."}, {"zh-tw": "大部分的時間裡我唯一做的事就是再三回憶與她的美好過往希望可以擺脫那種撕心裂肺的痛楚希望可以擺脫那種撕心裂肺的痛楚後來我成為一名神經學家所以我清楚關於那人的回憶和其中隱含的糟糕又情緒化的部分受大腦中不同系統的影響很大", "en": "So for the longest time, all I would do is recall the memory of thisperson over and over again, wishing that I could getrid of that gut-wrenching, visceral \"blah\" feeling. Now, as it turns out,I'm a neuroscientist, so I knew that the memory of that person and the awful, emotional undertonesthat color in that memory, are largely mediatedby separate brain systems."}, {"zh-tw": "所以我想，要是我們能夠進入腦部刪除那些難受的情緒同時又保留關於那人的完整記憶，不是很好嗎？後來我明瞭，也許這對現今而言是有點遙不可及要是我們可以從進入大腦裡先找到一段記憶作為開始呢？我們能再啟動那段記憶讓它起死回生、甚至玩弄那段記憶的內容嗎？即便如此，我仍強烈希望她現在沒有看這個演講即便如此，我仍強烈希望她現在沒有看這個演講", "en": "And so I thought, what if we couldgo into the brain and edit out that nauseating feeling but while keeping the memoryof that person intact? Then I realized, maybethat's a little bit lofty for now. So what if we could startoff by going into the brain and just finding a singlememory to begin with? Could we jump-startthat memory back to life, maybe even play with the contentsof that memory? All that said, there is one personin the entire world right now that I really hope is notwatching this talk."}, {"zh-tw": "還有一個問題，棘手的問題這些想法可能會讓你聯想到《攔截記憶碼》《王牌冤家》或者《全面啟動》但是和我們共事的電影明星可是實驗室的名人啊", "en": "So there is a catch. There is a catch. These ideas probably remindyou of \"Total Recall,\" \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,\" or of \"Inception.\" But the movie stars that we work with are the celebrities of the lab."}, {"zh-tw": "劉旭：實驗鼠作為神經學家，我們在實驗室用老鼠做實驗為了了解記憶是如何運作的", "en": "Xu Liu: Test mice. As neuroscientists, we workin the lab with mice trying to understand how memory works."}, {"zh-tw": "今天，我希望說服你們我們現在能以光速啟動大腦裡的記憶我們現在能以光速啟動大腦裡的記憶要做到這點，只需兩個簡單的步驟", "en": "And today, we hopeto convince you that now we are actually able to activatea memory in the brain at the speed of light. To do this, there's only two simplesteps to follow."}, {"zh-tw": "首先，在大腦裡找到一段記憶並將其標記然後，用開關啟動它就這麼簡單", "en": "First, you find and labela memory in the brain, and then you activate it with a switch. As simple as that."}, {"zh-tw": "斯蒂夫：你們被說服了嗎？其實，要在大腦裡找到一段記憶沒那麼容易劉旭：的確，這可是比在乾草堆裡找針難多了劉旭：的確，這可是比在乾草堆裡找針難多了因為至少，你還能用手抓住那根針因為至少，你還能用手抓住那根針", "en": "SR: Are you convinced? So, turns out finding a memoryin the brain isn't all that easy. XL: Indeed. This is way moredifficult than, let's say, finding a needle in a haystack, because at least, you know,the needle is still something you can physically put your fingers on."}, {"zh-tw": "但記憶卻不行而且腦細胞的數量遠勝於乾草堆裡稻草的數量", "en": "But memory is not. And also, there's waymore cells in your brain than the number of strawsin a typical haystack."}, {"zh-tw": "所以說，這個工作看來真令人卻步但幸運的是，大腦給了我們幫助", "en": "So yeah, this task doesseem to be daunting. But luckily, we got helpfrom the brain itself."}, {"zh-tw": "事實證明，我們需要做的只是讓大腦形成一段記憶然後大腦就會告訴我們哪些細胞和那段記憶有關斯蒂夫：當回憶前任女友的時候我的大腦是什麼狀況呢？假設你們現在暫且完全無視道德倫常把我的大腦切片你們會發現當我回憶她的時候大腦的活躍區域數量之驚人", "en": "It turned out that all we needto do is basically to let the brain form a memory, and then the brain will tellus which cells are involved in that particular memory. SR: So what was going on in my brain while I was recalling the memory of an ex? If you were to just completelyignore human ethics for a second and slice up my brain right now, you would see that therewas an amazing number of brain regions that were activewhile recalling that memory."}, {"zh-tw": "有一個極其活躍的大腦區域叫做海馬體數十年來它一直被視為處理跟我們所珍視的與親愛的記憶相關的器官它也成為我們試圖尋找、甚至重新啟動某一段記憶的理想目標劉旭：當把海馬體放大你肯定會看到很多細胞但我們可以找到與某段記憶相關的細胞但我們可以找到與某段記憶相關的細胞因為，當一個細胞呈現活躍的狀態例如一段記憶形成時它也會留下一道印記，好讓我們知道這些細胞最近是活躍的", "en": "Now one brain regionthat would be robustly active in particular is called the hippocampus, which for decades hasbeen implicated in processing the kinds of memoriesthat we hold near and dear, which also makes itan ideal target to go into and to try and find and maybereactivate a memory. XL: When you zoom in into the hippocampus, of course you will see lots of cells, but we are able to findwhich cells are involved in a particular memory, because whenever a cell is active, like when it's forming a memory, it will also leave a footprintthat will later allow us to know these cells are recently active."}, {"zh-tw": "斯蒂夫：同樣地，晚上大樓有燈亮著時你會知道當時應該有人還在那兒工作確切地說，生物傳感器當一個細胞在工作的時候就會開啟它們有點像一個亮著的生物窗讓我們知道這個細胞是活躍的", "en": "SR: So the same waythat building lights at night let you know that somebody's probablyworking there at any given moment, in a very real sense, thereare biological sensors within a cell that are turned on only when that cell was just working. They're sort of biologicalwindows that light up to let us know that that cellwas just active."}, {"zh-tw": "劉旭：於是我們剪下部分的傳感器把它粘在細胞的開關上來控制細胞然後把這個開關塞進一個工程病毒裡再注入老鼠的大腦所以，每當一段記憶形成時任何相關的活躍細胞都會安裝上這個開關", "en": "XL: So we clipped part of this sensor, and attached that to a switchto control the cells, and we packed this switchinto an engineered virus and injected that into the brainof the mice. So whenever a memory is being formed, any active cells for that memory will also have this switch installed."}, {"zh-tw": "斯蒂夫：比如說，這就是海馬體形成一段恐懼記憶後的樣子你看到的藍色部份就是密集的腦細胞而這些綠色的腦細胞呢綠色細胞就是與那段特定的恐懼記憶緊密連結的細胞", "en": "SR: So here is what the hippocampuslooks like after forming a fear memory, for example. The sea of blue that you see here are densely packed brain cells, but the green brain cells, the green brain cellsare the ones that are holding on to a specific fear memory."}, {"zh-tw": "你們看到的，就是那結晶體瞬間形成的恐懼結晶體此刻你們看到的其實是一段記憶的橫截面", "en": "So you are looking at the crystallization of the fleeting formation of fear. You're actually lookingat the cross-section of a memory right now."}, {"zh-tw": "劉旭：現在，談談我們剛才提到的開關理想狀態下，它必須運作得非常快幾分鐘或幾小時都太久了", "en": "XL: Now, for the switchwe have been talking about, ideally, the switch hasto act really fast. It shouldn't take minutesor hours to work."}, {"zh-tw": "它應以大腦的速度運作，以毫秒為單位斯蒂夫：你怎麼看呢，阿旭？我們能不能用像是... 藥用藥來啟動或靜止腦細胞？劉旭：算了吧，用藥太麻煩了，搞得到處都是", "en": "It should act at the speedof the brain, in milliseconds. SR: So what do you think, Xu? Could we use, let's say,pharmacological drugs to activate or inactivate brain cells? XL: Nah. Drugs are pretty messy.They spread everywhere."}, {"zh-tw": "而且要對腦細胞起作用也太久了我們不可能透過藥來及時控制記憶", "en": "And also it takes themforever to act on cells. So it will not allow usto control a memory in real time."}, {"zh-tw": "斯蒂夫，我們電擊大腦怎麼樣？斯蒂夫：電的速度也挺快的但是我們不太可能只擊中那些正好與某段記憶密切相關的細胞而且我們還可能把大腦給電糊了劉旭：那倒是啊！嗯，那看來我們的確需要更好的方法以光速來影響大腦", "en": "So Steve, how about let's zapthe brain with electricity? SR: So electricity is pretty fast, but we probably wouldn'tbe able to target it to just the specific cellsthat hold onto a memory, and we'd probably fry the brain. XL: Oh. That's true.So it looks like, hmm, indeed we need to find a better way to impact the brain at the speed of light."}, {"zh-tw": "斯蒂夫：恰巧，光是以光速行進的若我們要啟動或靜止記憶光也許可以派上用場劉旭：它的確很快", "en": "SR: So it just so happens that lighttravels at the speed of light. So maybe we could activateor inactive memories by just using light -- XL: That's pretty fast."}, {"zh-tw": "斯蒂夫：而且，正常情況下腦細胞對光脈衝沒反應所以，那些對光脈衝有反應的細胞就是安裝了光感開關的細胞要做到這個，我們先要哄騙腦細胞讓它們對雷射光有反應", "en": "SR: -- and because normally brain cells don't respond to pulses of light, so those that would respondto pulses of light are those that containa light-sensitive switch. Now to do that, first we needto trick brain cells to respond to laser beams."}, {"zh-tw": "劉旭：對，你們沒聽錯我們要把雷射光射入大腦", "en": "XL: Yep. You heard it right. We are trying to shootlasers into the brain."}, {"zh-tw": "斯蒂夫：光基因技術使之成為可能我們可以使用光基因技術的光開關來啟動或靜止腦細胞這個開關的名字就叫「通道視紫紅質」（譯註︰又稱「光敏感通道」）就是這些附在這個細胞上的綠點", "en": "SR: And the technique that letsus do that is optogenetics. Optogenetics gave us thislight switch that we can use to turn brain cells on or off, and the name of that switchis channelrhodopsin, seen here as these green dotsattached to this brain cell."}, {"zh-tw": "你們可以把通道視紫紅質視為一種光感開關它可以以人工的方式安裝在腦細胞上所以我們可以透過簡單地按下開關來啟動或靜止腦細胞這裡呢，我們用光脈衝來開啟它劉旭：於是我們把通道視紫紅質光感開關粘到剛才提到的傳感器上然後將其注入大腦", "en": "You can think of channelrhodopsinas a sort of light-sensitive switch that can be artificiallyinstalled in brain cells so that now we can use that switch to activate or inactivate the braincell simply by clicking it, and in this case we clickit on with pulses of light. XL: So we attach this light-sensitiveswitch of channelrhodopsin to the sensor we've been talking about and inject this into the brain."}, {"zh-tw": "所以，每當一段記憶形成時所有與那段記憶相關的活躍細胞都會被安裝上這個光感開關以便我們透過輕擊雷射開關來控制這些細胞，就像你們看到的這樣斯蒂夫：現在讓我們對這些進行測試", "en": "So whenever a memory is being formed, any active cell for that particular memory will also have this light-sensitiveswitch installed in it so that we can control these cells by the flipping of a laserjust like this one you see. SR: So let's put all of thisto the test now."}, {"zh-tw": "我們能做的就是把老鼠放進這樣的一個盒子裡輕微地電擊牠們的足部牠們對這個盒子便形成恐懼記憶牠們記得在這裡發生過不好的事", "en": "What we can do is we can take our mice and then we can put them in a boxthat looks exactly like this box here, and then we can give thema very mild foot shock so that they form a fearmemory of this box. They learn that somethingbad happened here."}, {"zh-tw": "現在，透過我們的系統這些在海馬體內活躍的細胞正形成記憶只有那些細胞才含有通道視紫紅質劉旭：如果你像老鼠一樣小你會覺得全世界都想抓住你", "en": "Now with our system,the cells that are active in the hippocampusin the making of this memory, only those cells will nowcontain channelrhodopsin. XL: When you are as small as a mouse, it feels as if the wholeworld is trying to get you."}, {"zh-tw": "所以你最好的防禦反應就是盡量不被發現當老鼠恐懼的時候就會表現出這種典型的行為縮在盒子角落，一動也不動縮在盒子角落，一動也不動這個姿勢叫做「行為凍結」", "en": "So your best response of defense is trying to be undetected. Whenever a mouse is in fear, it will show this very typical behavior by staying at one corner of the box, trying to not move any part of its body, and this posture is called freezing."}, {"zh-tw": "所以如果老鼠記得在這個盒子裡發生過不好的事當我們把牠們放回同一個盒子裡時就會表現出「行為凍結」因為牠不想被盒子裡任何對牠構成威脅的物體發現斯蒂夫：你們可以把「行為凍結」看作當你自顧自的走在街上突如其來你差點撞見前女友或前男友在那恐怖的兩秒間隔裡你會想︰「我該怎麼辦？要問好嗎？要跟他們握手嗎？我該轉身跑掉嗎？我該待在原地假裝我不存在嗎？」那些閃念就會讓你的行為木訥會讓你當下看起來不知所措一臉茫然", "en": "So if a mouse remembers that somethingbad happened in this box, and when we put themback into the same box, it will basically show freezing because it doesn't want to be detected by any potential threats in this box. SR: So you can think of freezing as, you're walking down the streetminding your own business, and then out of nowhereyou almost run into an ex-girlfriend or ex-boyfriend, and now those terrifying two seconds where you start thinking, \"What do I do?Do I say hi? Do I shake their hand? DoI turn around and run away? Do I sit here and pretendlike I don't exist?\" Those kinds of fleeting thoughtsthat physically incapacitate you, that temporarily give youthat deer-in-headlights look."}, {"zh-tw": "然而，如果你把這隻老鼠放到一個全然不同的新盒子裡，比如這個牠就不會害怕這個盒子因為牠沒理由害怕這個新環境但是，若我們把這隻老鼠放到新盒子裡而且同時用雷射啟動牠的恐懼記憶呢？就像剛才那樣我們能把第一個盒子裡的恐懼記憶帶到這個新環境嗎？斯蒂夫：好，這就是那個寶貴的實驗", "en": "XL: However, if you put the mousein a completely different new box, like the next one, it will not be afraid of this box because there's no reason that itwill be afraid of this new environment. But what if we putthe mouse in this new box but at the same time,we activate the fear memory using lasers just like we did before? Are we going to bring back the fear memory for the first box into thiscompletely new environment? SR: All right,and here's the million-dollar experiment."}, {"zh-tw": "現在，把那天的記憶復甦吧我記得紅襪隊剛贏了比賽一個綠意盎然的春日正適合去溯溪也許再去北城買些奶酪卷，隨便說說而已而阿旭和我呢則在一個無窗的黑暗房間裡目不轉睛連眨眼都沒有因為我們的目光都聚焦在電腦螢幕上", "en": "Now to bring back to lifethe memory of that day, I remember that the Red Sox had just won, it was a green spring day, perfect for going up and down the river and then maybe going to the North End to get some cannolis, #justsaying. Now Xu and I, on the other hand, were in a completely windowless black room not making any ocular movementthat even remotely resembles an eye blink because our eyes were fixedonto a computer screen."}, {"zh-tw": "我們正盯著這隻老鼠首次試著用我們的技術去啟動牠的記憶劉旭：然後我們就看到了這個", "en": "We were looking at this mousehere trying to activate a memory for the first time using our technique. XL: And this is what we saw."}, {"zh-tw": "當我們第一次把老鼠放進盒子裡牠在熟悉環境、四處嗅嗅、到處走動專注著自己的事因為天性使然老鼠的好奇心很強牠們想知道這個新盒子裡是怎樣的很有趣", "en": "When we first put the mouse into this box, it's exploring, sniffingaround, walking around, minding its own business, because actually by nature, mice are pretty curious animals. They want to know, what's goingon in this new box? It's interesting."}, {"zh-tw": "但是當我們開啟雷射時，就像你看到的這隻老鼠突然就進入了「行為凍結」模式牠待在原處試著不移動身體", "en": "But the moment we turnedon the laser, like you see now, all of a sudden the mouseentered this freezing mode. It stayed here and tried notto move any part of its body."}, {"zh-tw": "很明顯是「行為凍結」看起來，我們的確可以喚回在第一個盒子裡的恐懼記憶並帶到這個全新的環境", "en": "Clearly it's freezing. So indeed, it lookslike we are able to bring back the fear memory for the first box in this completely new environment."}, {"zh-tw": "看到這個情況，斯蒂夫和我像老鼠一樣震驚實驗結束後，我們兩人離開了實驗室什麼也沒說", "en": "While watching this, Steve and I are as shocked as the mouse itself. So after the experiment,the two of us just left the room without saying anything."}, {"zh-tw": "一段又長又尷尬的時間之後斯蒂夫打破了沉默斯蒂夫：「剛才那個起作用了？」劉旭：我說「對，起作用了！」我們對此非常興奮", "en": "After a kind of long,awkward period of time, Steve broke the silence. SR: \"Did that just work?\" XL: \"Yes,\" I said. \"Indeed it worked!\" We're really excited about this."}, {"zh-tw": "後來我們把我們的發現發表在《自然》科學期刊上自從發表之後我們得到了無數來自網際網路的評論我們得到了無數來自網際網路的評論", "en": "And then we published our findings in the journal Nature. Ever since the publication of our work, we've been receiving numerous comments from all over the Internet."}, {"zh-tw": "也許我們可以看看其中幾篇「天啊！終於！隨之而來的東西太多了，虛擬現實、神經操縱、夢幻仿真......神經編碼、記憶編輯、心理障礙治療，未來太美好了！」斯蒂夫：首先你會注意到人們對此類發現懷有強烈的看法", "en": "Maybe we can take a look at some of those. [\"OMGGGGG FINALLY... so much more to come, virtual reality, neural manipulation, visual dream emulation...neural coding, 'writing and re-writing of memories', mental illnesses. Ahhh the future is awesome\"] SR: So the first thingthat you'll notice is that people have really strong opinionsabout this kind of work."}, {"zh-tw": "而我剛好對第一個評論的樂觀抱持完全贊同態度因為，從零開始到摩根·弗里曼說的話恰巧成了最引人共鳴的讚揚而且我已經聽到了但是，看法也不盡然是剛才那種", "en": "Now I happen to completelyagree with the optimism of this first quote, because on a scaleof zero to Morgan Freeman's voice, it happens to beone of the most evocative accolades that I've heard come our way. But as you'll see, it's notthe only opinion that's out there."}, {"zh-tw": "「這太嚇人了吧，要是他們幾年之後輕易在人身上實驗的話......我們完了！」劉旭：的確，如果我們仔細看第二個評論我想我們不得不同意那個看法儘管不太正面但這同時也提醒我們雖然我們仍用老鼠做實驗但這可能是一個好主意開始去思考與商討關於記憶控制可能衍生的倫理道德上的影響關於記憶控制可能衍生的倫理道德上的影響", "en": "[\"This scares the hell out of me... What if they could do that easilyin humans in a couple of years?! OH MY GOD WE'RE DOOMED\"] XL: Indeed, if we takea look at the second one, I think we can all agree that it's, meh, probably not as positive. But this also reminds us that, although we are still working with mice, it's probably a good ideato start thinking and discussing about the possible ethical ramifications of memory control."}, {"zh-tw": "斯蒂夫：現在，借助第三個評論我們想告訴大家我們最近的一個實驗計畫我們稱之為《植入記憶》計畫「他們應該據此拍一部電影：他們把思想植入人腦，然後控制那些人去實現他們的目的。稱之為《植入記憶》」所以，我們推斷，現在我們可以啟動一段記憶要是啟動之後我們對那段記憶動手腳呢？我們能把它轉變為虛假記憶嗎？劉旭：所有記憶都是精密複雜且有活力的而為了簡單說明我們把記憶想像成一個電影片段", "en": "SR: Now, in the spirit of the third quote, we want to tell you about a recentproject that we've been working on in lab that we've calledProject Inception. [\"They should make a movie about this. Where they plant ideas into peoples minds,so they can control them for their own personal gain. We'll call it: Inception.\"] So we reasoned that nowthat we can reactivate a memory, what if we do so but then beginto tinker with that memory? Could we possibly even turnit into a false memory? XL: So all memoryis sophisticated and dynamic, but if just for simplicity,let's imagine memory as a movie clip."}, {"zh-tw": "目前為止我們告訴大家的都是我們能控制電影片段的「播放鍵」所以我們可以隨時隨地播放這段影像但是，有沒有可能我們可以進入大腦裡然後編輯這個電影片段以致讓它和原版不同是的，我們可以做到", "en": "So far what we've told youis basically we can control this \"play\" button of the clip so that we can play this videoclip any time, anywhere. But is there a possibilitythat we can actually get inside the brain and edit this movie clip so that we can make itdifferent from the original? Yes we can."}, {"zh-tw": "其實我們要做的只是就如先前用雷射去重新啟動一段記憶但同時，如果我們把新訊息呈現出來然後把新訊息與舊記憶合併就會改變那段記憶這有點像製作混音磁帶", "en": "Turned out that all we needto do is basically reactivate a memory usinglasers just like we did before, but at the same time,if we present new information and allow this new informationto incorporate into this old memory, this will change the memory. It's sort of like making a remix tape."}, {"zh-tw": "斯蒂夫：那我們該怎麼做呢？與其在大腦裡尋找一段恐懼記憶我們可以開始把動物放進這樣一個藍色盒子裡然後找到代表這個藍盒子的腦細胞讓它們對光脈衝產生反應正如我們剛才說的那樣次日，我們就取出動物把牠們放進一個從未待過的紅盒子裡", "en": "SR: So how do we do this? Rather than finding a fearmemory in the brain, we can start by taking our animals, and let's say we put them in a bluebox like this blue box here and we find the brain cellsthat represent that blue box and we trick them to respondto pulses of light exactly like we had said before. Now the next day, we can takeour animals and place them in a red box that they've neverexperienced before."}, {"zh-tw": "把雷射光射進牠們的大腦重新啟動在藍盒子裡的記憶接下來會發生什麼呢？如果當這個動物正回想在藍盒子裡的記憶時我們輕微地電擊牠的足部現在我們嘗試以人為的方式建立在藍盒子記憶與足部電擊之間的關聯", "en": "We can shoot lightinto the brain to reactivate the memory of the blue box. So what would happen hereif, while the animal is recalling the memory of the blue box, we gave it a couple of mild foot shocks? So here we're trying to artificiallymake an association between the memory of the blue box and the foot shocks themselves."}, {"zh-tw": "只是讓兩者聯結起來為了檢測我們是否成功我們再次取出動物並放回到藍盒子裡", "en": "We're just trying to connect the two. So to test if we had done so, we can take our animals once again and place them back in the blue box."}, {"zh-tw": "我們再次啟動那段藍盒子記憶並同時輕微電擊牠的足部這次牠突然僵住了彷彿喚回在這個環境曾被電擊的記憶儘管那從未發生", "en": "Again, we had just reactivatedthe memory of the blue box while the animal got a coupleof mild foot shocks, and now the animal suddenly freezes. It's as though it's recalling beingmildly shocked in this environment even though that never actually happened."}, {"zh-tw": "牠產生了一段虛假的記憶因為牠毫無根據地對這個環境感到恐懼在那個環境裡，技術上說來並沒不好的遭遇劉旭：所以目前為止，我們只在談光控制開關上的「開」鍵", "en": "So it formed a false memory, because it's falselyfearing an environment where, technically speaking, nothing bad actually happened to it. XL: So, so far we are only talking about this light-controlled \"on\" switch."}, {"zh-tw": "其實我們也有「關」鍵而且很容易想像透過安裝這個由光控制的「關」鍵我們同樣能隨時隨地關閉一段記憶今天我們說的一切都是基於下面這個神經科學的哲學原則：雖然記憶看起來神秘難解其實是由可修補的實體物質所組成", "en": "In fact, we also havea light-controlled \"off\" switch, and it's very easy to imagine that by installing thislight-controlled \"off\" switch, we can also turn off a memory,any time, anywhere.

I also see a world where we canerase unwanted memories."}, {"zh-tw": "如今，我甚至看到編輯記憶都可能成真因為，在我們生活的時代我們能把科幻小說裡的疑問搬到現實生活中進行檢驗劉旭：現今，全世界無論是從事科研的人或其他研究的人都在運用類似的方法啟動或編輯記憶不管方法是新或舊、正面或負面各種的記憶，藉此我們能了解記憶運作的方式", "en": "Now, I even see a worldwhere editing memories is something of a reality, because we're living in a timewhere it's possible to pluck questions from the treeof science fiction and to ground themin experimental reality. XL: Nowadays, people in the lab and people in othergroups all over the world are using similar methodsto activate or edit memories, whether that's old or new,positive or negative, all sorts of memories sothat we can understand how memory works."}, {"zh-tw": "斯蒂夫：比如說，我們實驗室有一個團隊曾找到組成恐懼記憶的細胞然後把它轉化成了快樂記憶，就像那樣這樣的程序就是我所說的編輯記憶", "en": "SR: For example, one group in our lab was able to find the brain cellsthat make up a fear memory and converted them into a pleasurablememory, just like that. That's exactly what I mean about editingthese kinds of processes."}, {"zh-tw": "我們實驗室有位老兄甚至能重新啟動雄鼠的大腦裡一段有關雌鼠的記憶據說那可是相當愉快的經驗啊劉旭：的確，我們生長在一個令人非常振奮的時代科學不受任何的限制唯獨被我們的想像力所局限", "en": "Now one dude in labwas even able to reactivate memories of female mice in male mice, which rumor has itis a pleasurable experience.

How do we push this technology forward? These are the questionsthat should not remain just inside the lab, and so one goal of today's talkwas to bring everybody up to speed with the kindof stuff that's possible in modern neuroscience, but now, just as importantly, to actively engage everybodyin this conversation.
