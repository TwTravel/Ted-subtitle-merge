Now, as it turns out,I'm a neuroscientist, so I knew that the memory of that person and the awful, emotional undertonesthat color in that memory, are largely mediatedby separate brain systems.", "en": " 大部分的時間裡我唯一做的事 就是再三回憶與她的美好過往 希望可以擺脫那種撕心裂肺的痛楚 希望可以擺脫那種撕心裂肺的痛楚 後來我成為一名神經學家 所以我清楚關於那人的回憶 和其中隱含的糟糕又情緒化的部分 受大腦中不同系統的影響很大"}, {"zh-tw": " And so I thought, what if we couldgo into the brain and edit out that nauseating feeling but while keeping the memoryof that person intact? Then I realized, maybethat's a little bit lofty for now. So what if we could startoff by going into the brain and just finding a singlememory to begin with? Could we jump-startthat memory back to life, maybe even play with the contentsof that memory? All that said, there is one personin the entire world right now that I really hope is notwatching this talk.", "en": " 所以我想，要是我們能夠進入腦部 刪除那些難受的情緒 同時又保留關於那人的完整記憶，不是很好嗎？ 後來我明瞭，也許這對現今而言是有點遙不可及 要是我們可以從進入大腦裡 先找到一段記憶作為開始呢？ 我們能再啟動那段記憶讓它起死回生、 甚至玩弄那段記憶的內容嗎？ 即便如此，我仍強烈希望她現在沒有看這個演講 即便如此，我仍強烈希望她現在沒有看這個演講"}, {"zh-tw": " So there is a catch. There is a catch. These ideas probably remindyou of \"Total Recall,\" \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,\" or of \"Inception.\" But the movie stars that we work with are the celebrities of the lab.", "en": " 還有一個問題，棘手的問題 這些想法可能會讓你聯想到《攔截記憶碼》 《王牌冤家》 或者《全面啟動》 但是和我們共事的電影明星 可是實驗室的名人啊"}, {"zh-tw": " Xu Liu: Test mice.

To do this, there's only two simplesteps to follow.", "en": " 今天，我希望說服你們 我們現在能以光速啟動大腦裡的記憶 我們現在能以光速啟動大腦裡的記憶 要做到這點，只需兩個簡單的步驟"}, {"zh-tw": " First, you find and labela memory in the brain, and then you activate it with a switch. As simple as that.", "en": " 首先，在大腦裡找到一段記憶並將其標記 然後，用開關啟動它 就這麼簡單"}, {"zh-tw": " SR: Are you convinced? So, turns out finding a memoryin the brain isn't all that easy. XL: Indeed. This is way moredifficult than, let's say, finding a needle in a haystack, because at least, you know,the needle is still something you can physically put your fingers on.", "en": " 斯蒂夫：你們被說服了嗎？ 其實，要在大腦裡找到一段記憶沒那麼容易 劉旭：的確，這可是比在乾草堆裡找針難多了 劉旭：的確，這可是比在乾草堆裡找針難多了 因為至少，你還能用手抓住那根針 因為至少，你還能用手抓住那根針"}, {"zh-tw": " But memory is not. And also, there's waymore cells in your brain than the number of strawsin a typical haystack.", "en": " 但記憶卻不行 而且腦細胞的數量遠勝於 乾草堆裡稻草的數量"}, {"zh-tw": " So yeah, this task doesseem to be daunting. But luckily, we got helpfrom the brain itself.", "en": " 所以說，這個工作看來真令人卻步 但幸運的是，大腦給了我們幫助"}, {"zh-tw": " It turned out that all we needto do is basically to let the brain form a memory, and then the brain will tellus which cells are involved in that particular memory. SR: So what was going on in my brain while I was recalling the memory of an ex? If you were to just completelyignore human ethics for a second and slice up my brain right now, you would see that therewas an amazing number of brain regions that were activewhile recalling that memory.", "en": " 事實證明，我們需要做的 只是讓大腦形成一段記憶 然後大腦就會告訴我們哪些細胞 和那段記憶有關 斯蒂夫：當回憶前任女友的時候 我的大腦是什麼狀況呢？ 假設你們現在暫且完全無視道德倫常 把我的大腦切片 你們會發現當我回憶她的時候 大腦的活躍區域數量之驚人"}, {"zh-tw": " Now one brain regionthat would be robustly active in particular is called the hippocampus, which for decades hasbeen implicated in processing the kinds of memoriesthat we hold near and dear, which also makes itan ideal target to go into and to try and find and maybereactivate a memory. XL: When you zoom in into the hippocampus, of course you will see lots of cells, but we are able to findwhich cells are involved in a particular memory, because whenever a cell is active, like when it's forming a memory, it will also leave a footprintthat will later allow us to know these cells are recently active.", "en": " 有一個極其活躍的大腦區域 叫做海馬體 數十年來它一直被視為 處理跟我們所珍視的與親愛的記憶相關的器官 它也成為我們試圖尋找、 甚至重新啟動某一段記憶的理想目標 劉旭：當把海馬體放大 你肯定會看到很多細胞 但我們可以找到與某段記憶相關的細胞 但我們可以找到與某段記憶相關的細胞 因為，當一個細胞呈現活躍的狀態 例如一段記憶形成時 它也會留下一道印記，好讓我們知道 這些細胞最近是活躍的"}, {"zh-tw": " SR: So the same waythat building lights at night let you know that somebody's probablyworking there at any given moment, in a very real sense, thereare biological sensors within a cell that are turned on only when that cell was just working. They're sort of biologicalwindows that light up to let us know that that cellwas just active.", "en": " 斯蒂夫：同樣地，晚上大樓有燈亮著時 你會知道當時應該有人還在那兒工作 確切地說，生物傳感器 當一個細胞在工作的時候 就會開啟 它們有點像一個亮著的生物窗 讓我們知道這個細胞是活躍的"}, {"zh-tw": " XL: So we clipped part of this sensor, and attached that to a switchto control the cells, and we packed this switchinto an engineered virus and injected that into the brainof the mice. So whenever a memory is being formed, any active cells for that memory will also have this switch installed.", "en": " 劉旭：於是我們剪下部分的傳感器 把它粘在細胞的開關上來控制細胞 然後把這個開關塞進一個工程病毒裡 再注入老鼠的大腦 所以，每當一段記憶形成時 任何相關的活躍細胞 都會安裝上這個開關"}, {"zh-tw": " SR: So here is what the hippocampuslooks like after forming a fear memory, for example. The sea of blue that you see here are densely packed brain cells, but the green brain cells, the green brain cellsare the ones that are holding on to a specific fear memory.", "en": " 斯蒂夫：比如說，這就是海馬體 形成一段恐懼記憶後的樣子 你看到的藍色部份 就是密集的腦細胞 而這些綠色的腦細胞呢 綠色細胞就是與那段特定的恐懼記憶 緊密連結的細胞"}, {"zh-tw": " So you are looking at the crystallization of the fleeting formation of fear. You're actually lookingat the cross-section of a memory right now.", "en": " 你們看到的，就是那結晶體 瞬間形成的恐懼結晶體 此刻你們看到的其實是一段記憶的橫截面"}, {"zh-tw": " XL: Now, for the switchwe have been talking about, ideally, the switch hasto act really fast. It shouldn't take minutesor hours to work.", "en": " 劉旭：現在，談談我們剛才提到的開關 理想狀態下，它必須運作得非常快 幾分鐘或幾小時都太久了"}, {"zh-tw": " It should act at the speedof the brain, in milliseconds.

Drugs are pretty messy.They spread everywhere.", "en": " 它應以大腦的速度運作，以毫秒為單位 斯蒂夫：你怎麼看呢，阿旭？ 我們能不能用像是... 藥 用藥來啟動或靜止腦細胞？ 劉旭：算了吧，用藥太麻煩了，搞得到處都是"}, {"zh-tw": " And also it takes themforever to act on cells. So it will not allow usto control a memory in real time.", "en": " 而且要對腦細胞起作用也太久了 我們不可能透過藥來及時控制記憶"}, {"zh-tw": " So Steve, how about let's zapthe brain with electricity? SR: So electricity is pretty fast, but we probably wouldn'tbe able to target it to just the specific cellsthat hold onto a memory, and we'd probably fry the brain. XL: Oh. That's true.So it looks like, hmm, indeed we need to find a better way to impact the brain at the speed of light.", "en": " 斯蒂夫，我們電擊大腦怎麼樣？ 斯蒂夫：電的速度也挺快的 但是我們不太可能只擊中 那些正好與某段記憶密切相關的細胞 而且我們還可能把大腦給電糊了 劉旭：那倒是啊！嗯，那看來 我們的確需要更好的方法 以光速來影響大腦"}, {"zh-tw": " SR: So it just so happens that lighttravels at the speed of light. So maybe we could activateor inactive memories by just using light -- XL: That's pretty fast.", "en": " 斯蒂夫：恰巧，光是以光速行進的 若我們要啟動或靜止記憶 光也許可以派上用場 劉旭：它的確很快"}, {"zh-tw": " SR: -- and because normally brain cells don't respond to pulses of light, so those that would respondto pulses of light are those that containa light-sensitive switch. Now to do that, first we needto trick brain cells to respond to laser beams.", "en": " 斯蒂夫：而且，正常情況下腦細胞 對光脈衝沒反應 所以，那些對光脈衝有反應的細胞 就是安裝了光感開關的細胞 要做到這個，我們先要哄騙腦細胞 讓它們對雷射光有反應"}, {"zh-tw": " XL: Yep. You heard it right. We are trying to shootlasers into the brain.", "en": " 劉旭：對，你們沒聽錯 我們要把雷射光射入大腦"}, {"zh-tw": " SR: And the technique that letsus do that is optogenetics. Optogenetics gave us thislight switch that we can use to turn brain cells on or off, and the name of that switchis channelrhodopsin, seen here as these green dotsattached to this brain cell.", "en": " 斯蒂夫：光基因技術使之成為可能 我們可以使用光基因技術的光開關 來啟動或靜止腦細胞 這個開關的名字就叫「通道視紫紅質」（譯註︰又稱「光敏感通道」） 就是這些附在這個細胞上的綠點"}, {"zh-tw": " You can think of channelrhodopsinas a sort of light-sensitive switch that can be artificiallyinstalled in brain cells so that now we can use that switch to activate or inactivate the braincell simply by clicking it, and in this case we clickit on with pulses of light. XL: So we attach this light-sensitiveswitch of channelrhodopsin to the sensor we've been talking about and inject this into the brain.", "en": " 你們可以把通道視紫紅質視為一種光感開關 它可以以人工的方式安裝在腦細胞上 所以我們可以透過 簡單地按下開關來啟動或靜止腦細胞 這裡呢，我們用光脈衝來開啟它 劉旭：於是我們把通道視紫紅質光感開關粘到 剛才提到的傳感器上 然後將其注入大腦"}, {"zh-tw": " So whenever a memory is being formed, any active cell for that particular memory will also have this light-sensitiveswitch installed in it so that we can control these cells by the flipping of a laserjust like this one you see. SR: So let's put all of thisto the test now.", "en": " 所以，每當一段記憶形成時 所有與那段記憶相關的活躍細胞 都會被安裝上這個光感開關 以便我們透過輕擊雷射開關 來控制這些細胞，就像你們看到的這樣 斯蒂夫：現在讓我們對這些進行測試"}, {"zh-tw": " What we can do is we can take our mice and then we can put them in a boxthat looks exactly like this box here, and then we can give thema very mild foot shock so that they form a fearmemory of this box. They learn that somethingbad happened here.", "en": " 我們能做的就是把老鼠 放進這樣的一個盒子裡 輕微地電擊牠們的足部 牠們對這個盒子便形成恐懼記憶 牠們記得在這裡發生過不好的事"}, {"zh-tw": " Now with our system,the cells that are active in the hippocampusin the making of this memory, only those cells will nowcontain channelrhodopsin. XL: When you are as small as a mouse, it feels as if the wholeworld is trying to get you.", "en": " 現在，透過我們的系統 這些在海馬體內活躍的細胞正形成記憶 只有那些細胞才含有通道視紫紅質 劉旭：如果你像老鼠一樣小 你會覺得全世界都想抓住你"}, {"zh-tw": " So your best response of defense is trying to be undetected. Whenever a mouse is in fear, it will show this very typical behavior by staying at one corner of the box, trying to not move any part of its body, and this posture is called freezing.", "en": " 所以你最好的防禦反應 就是盡量不被發現 當老鼠恐懼的時候 就會表現出這種典型的行為 縮在盒子角落，一動也不動 縮在盒子角落，一動也不動 這個姿勢叫做「行為凍結」"}, {"zh-tw": " So if a mouse remembers that somethingbad happened in this box, and when we put themback into the same box, it will basically show freezing because it doesn't want to be detected by any potential threats in this box. SR: So you can think of freezing as, you're walking down the streetminding your own business, and then out of nowhereyou almost run into an ex-girlfriend or ex-boyfriend, and now those terrifying two seconds where you start thinking, \"What do I do?Do I say hi? Do I shake their hand? DoI turn around and run away? Do I sit here and pretendlike I don't exist?\" Those kinds of fleeting thoughtsthat physically incapacitate you, that temporarily give youthat deer-in-headlights look.", "en": " 所以如果老鼠記得在這個盒子裡發生過不好的事 當我們把牠們放回同一個盒子裡時 就會表現出「行為凍結」 因為牠不想被盒子裡 任何對牠構成威脅的物體發現 斯蒂夫：你們可以把「行為凍結」看作 當你自顧自的走在街上 突如其來你差點 撞見前女友或前男友 在那恐怖的兩秒間隔裡 你會想︰「我該怎麼辦？要問好嗎？ 要跟他們握手嗎？我該轉身跑掉嗎？ 我該待在原地假裝我不存在嗎？」 那些閃念就會讓你的行為木訥 會讓你當下看起來不知所措一臉茫然"}, {"zh-tw": " XL: However, if you put the mousein a completely different new box, like the next one, it will not be afraid of this box because there's no reason that itwill be afraid of this new environment. But what if we putthe mouse in this new box but at the same time,we activate the fear memory using lasers just like we did before? Are we going to bring back the fear memory for the first box into thiscompletely new environment? SR: All right,and here's the million-dollar experiment.", "en": " 然而，如果你把這隻老鼠放到 一個全然不同的新盒子裡，比如這個 牠就不會害怕這個盒子 因為牠沒理由害怕這個新環境 但是，若我們把這隻老鼠放到新盒子裡 而且同時用雷射啟動牠的恐懼記憶呢？ 就像剛才那樣 我們能把第一個盒子裡的恐懼記憶 帶到這個新環境嗎？ 斯蒂夫：好，這就是那個寶貴的實驗"}, {"zh-tw": " Now to bring back to lifethe memory of that day, I remember that the Red Sox had just won, it was a green spring day, perfect for going up and down the river and then maybe going to the North End to get some cannolis, #justsaying. Now Xu and I, on the other hand, were in a completely windowless black room not making any ocular movementthat even remotely resembles an eye blink because our eyes were fixedonto a computer screen.", "en": " 現在，把那天的記憶復甦吧 我記得紅襪隊剛贏了比賽 一個綠意盎然的春日 正適合去溯溪 也許再去北城 買些奶酪卷，隨便說說而已 而阿旭和我呢 則在一個無窗的黑暗房間裡 目不轉睛連眨眼都沒有 因為我們的目光都聚焦在電腦螢幕上"}, {"zh-tw": " We were looking at this mousehere trying to activate a memory for the first time using our technique. XL: And this is what we saw.", "en": " 我們正盯著這隻老鼠 首次試著用我們的技術去啟動牠的記憶 劉旭：然後我們就看到了這個"}, {"zh-tw": " When we first put the mouse into this box, it's exploring, sniffingaround, walking around, minding its own business, because actually by nature, mice are pretty curious animals. They want to know, what's goingon in this new box? It's interesting.", "en": " 當我們第一次把老鼠放進盒子裡 牠在熟悉環境、四處嗅嗅、到處走動 專注著自己的事 因為天性使然 老鼠的好奇心很強 牠們想知道這個新盒子裡是怎樣的 很有趣"}, {"zh-tw": " But the moment we turnedon the laser, like you see now, all of a sudden the mouseentered this freezing mode. It stayed here and tried notto move any part of its body.", "en": " 但是當我們開啟雷射時，就像你看到的 這隻老鼠突然就進入了「行為凍結」模式 牠待在原處試著不移動身體"}, {"zh-tw": " Clearly it's freezing. So indeed, it lookslike we are able to bring back the fear memory for the first box in this completely new environment.", "en": " 很明顯是「行為凍結」 看起來，我們的確可以喚回 在第一個盒子裡的恐懼記憶 並帶到這個全新的環境"}, {"zh-tw": " While watching this, Steve and I are as shocked as the mouse itself. So after the experiment,the two of us just left the room without saying anything.", "en": " 看到這個情況，斯蒂夫和我 像老鼠一樣震驚 實驗結束後，我們兩人離開了實驗室 什麼也沒說"}, {"zh-tw": " After a kind of long,awkward period of time, Steve broke the silence. SR: \"Did that just work?\" XL: \"Yes,\" I said. \"Indeed it worked!\" We're really excited about this.", "en": " 一段又長又尷尬的時間之後 斯蒂夫打破了沉默 斯蒂夫：「剛才那個起作用了？」 劉旭：我說「對，起作用了！」 我們對此非常興奮"}, {"zh-tw": " And then we published our findings in the journal Nature. Ever since the publication of our work, we've been receiving numerous comments from all over the Internet.", "en": " 後來我們把我們的發現 發表在《自然》科學期刊上 自從發表之後 我們得到了無數來自網際網路的評論 我們得到了無數來自網際網路的評論"}, {"zh-tw": " Maybe we can take a look at some of those. [\"OMGGGGG FINALLY... so much more to come, virtual reality, neural manipulation, visual dream emulation...neural coding, 'writing and re-writing of memories', mental illnesses. Ahhh the future is awesome\"] SR: So the first thingthat you'll notice is that people have really strong opinionsabout this kind of work.", "en": " 也許我們可以看看其中幾篇 「天啊！終於！隨之而來的東西太多了，虛擬現實、神經操縱、夢幻仿真......神經編碼、記憶編輯、心理障礙治療，未來太美好了！」 斯蒂夫：首先你會注意到 人們對此類發現懷有強烈的看法"}, {"zh-tw": " Now I happen to completelyagree with the optimism of this first quote, because on a scaleof zero to Morgan Freeman's voice, it happens to beone of the most evocative accolades that I've heard come our way. But as you'll see, it's notthe only opinion that's out there.", "en": " 而我剛好對第一個評論的樂觀 抱持完全贊同態度 因為，從零開始到摩根·弗里曼說的話 恰巧成了最引人共鳴的讚揚 而且我已經聽到了 但是，看法也不盡然是剛才那種"}, {"zh-tw": " [\"This scares the hell out of me... What if they could do that easilyin humans in a couple of years?! OH MY GOD WE'RE DOOMED\"] XL: Indeed, if we takea look at the second one, I think we can all agree that it's, meh, probably not as positive. But this also reminds us that, although we are still working with mice, it's probably a good ideato start thinking and discussing about the possible ethical ramifications of memory control.", "en": " 「這太嚇人了吧，要是他們幾年之後輕易在人身上實驗的話......我們完了！」 劉旭：的確，如果我們仔細看第二個評論 我想我們不得不同意那個看法 儘管不太正面 但這同時也提醒我們 雖然我們仍用老鼠做實驗 但這可能是一個好主意開始去思考與商討 關於記憶控制可能衍生的倫理道德上的影響 關於記憶控制可能衍生的倫理道德上的影響"}, {"zh-tw": " SR: Now, in the spirit of the third quote, we want to tell you about a recentproject that we've been working on in lab that we've calledProject Inception. [\"They should make a movie about this. Where they plant ideas into peoples minds,so they can control them for their own personal gain. We'll call it: Inception.\"] So we reasoned that nowthat we can reactivate a memory, what if we do so but then beginto tinker with that memory? Could we possibly even turnit into a false memory? XL: So all memoryis sophisticated and dynamic, but if just for simplicity,let's imagine memory as a movie clip.", "en": " 斯蒂夫：現在，借助第三個評論 我們想告訴大家我們最近的一個實驗計畫 我們稱之為《植入記憶》計畫 「他們應該據此拍一部電影：他們把思想植入人腦，然後控制那些人去實現他們的目的。稱之為《植入記憶》」 所以，我們推斷，現在我們可以啟動一段記憶 要是啟動之後我們對那段記憶動手腳呢？ 我們能把它轉變為虛假記憶嗎？ 劉旭：所有記憶都是精密複雜且有活力的 而為了簡單說明 我們把記憶想像成一個電影片段"}, {"zh-tw": " So far what we've told youis basically we can control this \"play\" button of the clip so that we can play this videoclip any time, anywhere. But is there a possibilitythat we can actually get inside the brain and edit this movie clip so that we can make itdifferent from the original? Yes we can.", "en": " 目前為止我們告訴大家的都是 我們能控制電影片段的「播放鍵」 所以我們可以隨時隨地播放這段影像 但是，有沒有可能我們可以進入大腦裡 然後編輯這個電影片段 以致讓它和原版不同 是的，我們可以做到"}, {"zh-tw": " Turned out that all we needto do is basically reactivate a memory usinglasers just like we did before, but at the same time,if we present new information and allow this new informationto incorporate into this old memory, this will change the memory. It's sort of like making a remix tape.", "en": " 其實我們要做的只是 就如先前用雷射去重新啟動一段記憶 但同時，如果我們把新訊息呈現出來 然後把新訊息與舊記憶合併 就會改變那段記憶 這有點像製作混音磁帶"}, {"zh-tw": " SR: So how do we do this? Rather than finding a fearmemory in the brain, we can start by taking our animals, and let's say we put them in a bluebox like this blue box here and we find the brain cellsthat represent that blue box and we trick them to respondto pulses of light exactly like we had said before. Now the next day, we can takeour animals and place them in a red box that they've neverexperienced before.", "en": " 斯蒂夫：那我們該怎麼做呢？ 與其在大腦裡尋找一段恐懼記憶 我們可以開始把動物 放進這樣一個藍色盒子裡 然後找到代表這個藍盒子的腦細胞 讓它們對光脈衝產生反應 正如我們剛才說的那樣 次日，我們就取出動物把牠們 放進一個從未待過的紅盒子裡"}, {"zh-tw": " We can shoot lightinto the brain to reactivate the memory of the blue box.

So to test if we had done so, we can take our animals once again and place them back in the blue box.", "en": " 只是讓兩者聯結起來 為了檢測我們是否成功 我們再次取出動物 並放回到藍盒子裡"}, {"zh-tw": " Again, we had just reactivatedthe memory of the blue box while the animal got a coupleof mild foot shocks, and now the animal suddenly freezes. It's as though it's recalling beingmildly shocked in this environment even though that never actually happened.", "en": " 我們再次啟動那段藍盒子記憶 並同時輕微電擊牠的足部 這次牠突然僵住了 彷彿喚回在這個環境曾被電擊的記憶 儘管那從未發生"}, {"zh-tw": " So it formed a false memory, because it's falselyfearing an environment where, technically speaking, nothing bad actually happened to it.

How do we push this technology forward?
