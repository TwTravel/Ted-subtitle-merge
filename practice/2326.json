Surveillance programs that listened inon the emails and phone calls of entire countries -- hundreds of millions of people -- setting aside whetherthose countries were our allies, setting aside what our interests were.

We may enter a period of constant warfare, and we know this becausewe've been in it for several years.", "en": " 至於安全這方面， 我們已經從冷戰裡出來 -- 因為核戰代價太高， 所以我們沒這麼做-- 進入一個我稱為『涼戰』的時期，也就是網路戰爭， 因為衝突成本很低，所以可能永遠不會停止。 我們可能進入了一個持續交戰的時期， 我們知道這點因為我們曾有多年經驗。"}, {"zh-tw": " And yet, we don't have the basic doctrinesto guide us in this regard.
