It's a handy-dandy quote from Hippocrates of the Hippocratic oath that says, \"The greater part of the soul lays outside the body, treatment of the inner requires treatment of the outer.\" But that suggests the issue that I'm trying to get at here, that we have an opportunity to redefine what is health.", "en": " 這個門診就像是其他大學的健康門診一樣 只不過人們來看診時 是想解決環境健康的擔憂 他們走出診所， 拿到的是改善環境健康的處方 而非一般生病了去看診 然後帶著藥方離開 在「醫師就職宣言」的作者，醫學之父Hippocrates，曾說過一句簡潔有用的話， 他說：「靈魂最珍貴的部份，是依附在身體以外的環境， 治療身體的內在，須先診治身體外在的環境。」 這句話其實暗示了今天 我想要討論的主題 也就是，我們需要重新定義何謂健康"}, {"zh-tw": " Because this idea that health is internal and atomized and individual and pharmaceutical is largely an error. And I would use this study, a recent study by Philip Landrigan, to motivate a different view of health, where he went to most of the pediatricians in Manhattan and the New York area and logged what they spent their patient hours on.", "en": " 因為相信健康是內裡的 微小的、個人的 藥物的 這樣的想法犯了很嚴重的錯誤 我將藉由一項研究， Philip Landrigan最近所做的這項研究 來引發一種不同觀點來看待「健康」 他拜訪了曼哈頓和紐約的 許多小兒科醫生 記錄他們遇到的病人類型"}, {"zh-tw": " 80 to 90 percent of their time was spent on five things.

They share your environmental stressors, the asbestos levels and lead levels, whatever you're exposed to.", "en": " 牠們甚至是更合適的環境健康指標生物 不只因為牠們與人類同樣屬於哺乳類 而且，牠們吃的食物幾乎就是我們平常所吃的。 牠們和我們共有同樣的環境壓力因子 包括環境中暴露的 石棉濃度和鉛含量"}, {"zh-tw": " And they're geographically more limited than you are, because we don't know if you've been exposed to persistent organic pollutants in your home, or occupationally or as a child. Mice are a very good representation.", "en": " 而老鼠的活動範圍不像你那麼多變 因為我們無法確定你是持續固定地 暴露於有機污染物中，在家中 還是在職場 或只在幼時才有接觸 老鼠則極具代表性"}, {"zh-tw": " So it starts by building a better mousetrap, of course. This is one of them.", "en": " 所以無庸置疑地，我們首先得做一個好一點的捕鼠器 這就是其中之一"}, {"zh-tw": " Coping with environmental stressors is tricky. Is anybody here on antidepressants? There's a lot of people in Manhattan are.", "en": " 對付環境壓力因子，其實是很弔詭的 現場有人在定時服用抗憂鬱劑嗎? 在曼哈頓，許多市民受憂鬱所苦"}, {"zh-tw": " And we were testing if the mice would also self-administer SSRIs. So this was Prozac, this was Zoloft, this was a black jellybean and this was muscle relaxant, all of which were the medications that the impatient was taking.", "en": " 我們在測試老鼠是否也會 自己去服用抗憂鬱劑 這個是百憂解，這是樂復得 這是黑色豆豆糖，還有這是肌肉鬆弛劑 這些都是人類這種「不耐煩患者」會服用的藥物"}, {"zh-tw": " So do you think the mice self-administered antidepressants? What's the -- (Audience: Sure. Yes.) How did you know that? They did. This was vodka and solution, gin and solution.", "en": " 所以你認為老鼠 會自己去吃抗憂鬱劑嗎? 是什麼 -- (觀眾：當然會) 你怎麼知道的? 牠們的確這麼做了 這裡有伏特加水溶液、琴酒水溶液"}, {"zh-tw": " This guy also liked plain water and the muscle relaxant. Where's our expert? Vodka, gin -- (Audience: [unclear]) Yes. Yes. You know your mice well.", "en": " 這傢伙也喜歡一般的水和肌肉鬆弛劑 我們的老鼠專家在哪? 伏特加、琴酒 -- (觀眾：[不清楚]) 對，對! 你真的很懂老鼠"}, {"zh-tw": " They did, yes. So they drank as much vodka as they did plain water, which was interesting.", "en": " 牠們就是這麼做 牠們喝了等量的伏特加和一般的水 這很有意思"}, {"zh-tw": " Then of course, it goes into the entrapment device. There's an old cellphone in there -- a good use for old cellphones -- which dials the clinic, we go and pick up the mouse.", "en": " 然後當然，牠走進了捕鼠器 裡面有個舊式手機 -- 老手機很好用 -- 手機就撥號給門診，我們就去把老鼠拿起來"}, {"zh-tw": " We take the blood sample and do the blood work and hair work on the mice.

In this case, instead of throwing chewing gum, or Doritos or whatever you have in your pocket at the fish -- There's a body of water in Iceland that I've been dealing with that's in the middle of the city, and the largest pollution burden on it is not the roadborne pollution, it's actually white bread from people feeding the fish and the birds.", "en": " 我很喜歡詮釋它為 一個溝通平台 它重寫了我們和大自然的互動 特別是，改變了誰才擁有資訊 資訊的位置， 誰能詮釋這些資訊 以及這些資訊能用來做什麼。 這樣一來，我們便不會隨意扔擲口香糖、 多力多滋玉米片、或是你口袋裡的任何東西給魚 我正在經手冰島的某一塊水域 它位在都市的中心 在這裡，最大的汙染負擔 並非路面汙染 而是人們拿來餵魚和餵鳥的 白吐司"}, {"zh-tw": " Instead of doing that actually, we've developed some fish sticks that you can feed the fish.

But in that action, that interaction, by re-scripting that, by changing it into an opportunity to offer food that is nutritionally appropriate, that could augment the nutritional resources that we ourselves have depleted for augmenting the fish population and also adding chelating agent, which, like any chelating agent that we use medicinally, binds to the bioaccumulated heavy metals and PCBs that are in the fish living in this particular habitat and allows them to pass it out as a harmless salt where it's complexed by a reactive, effectively removing it from bioavailability.", "en": " 在黃石公園 「禁止餵食」警示牌的數量 比那些你想餵食的動物還多 不過藉由這樣的行動，和大自然的互動 藉著重寫「互動」的定義 藉著改變，我們便有機會 提供營養適當的食物 增加原本被我們耗盡的 營養來源 讓魚群的數量蓬勃成長 此外，飼料中螫合劑的添加 就相當於螯合劑在藥學上的應用 它會和生物體內累積的重金屬和多氯聯苯結合 這些毒素存在於 特定水域的魚類體內 如此一來，螯合物就能讓魚類將毒素轉換為無毒的鹽類 它們結合為複合物，降低原本的生物活性 有效地從生物鏈中去除"}, {"zh-tw": " But I wanted to say that interaction, re-scripting that interaction, into collective action, collective remediative action, very different from the approach that's being used on the other side on the Hudson River, where we're dredging the PCBs -- after 30 years of legislative and legal struggle, GE's paying for the dredging of the largest Superfund site in the world -- we're dredging it, and it'll probably get shipped off to Pennsylvania or the nearest Third World country, where it will continue to be toxic sludge.
