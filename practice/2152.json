There were two big reasonswhy our campaign had failed big time.", "en": " 結果是，當我們反省自身 就更加了解到，這確實是我和我團隊的錯。 有二大理由說明了我們團隊非常失敗。"}, {"zh-tw": " One of those, the first reason, is we were standingagainst core values of people. We were saying no to somethingthat was very important to them, challenging their code of honor, and hurting them deeply in the process.", "en": " 其中第一個原因是， 我們違反人類的核心價值。 將人們認為重要的事物看得一聞不值， 挑戰人們的榮譽準則， 在過程上，對他們傷害極深。"}, {"zh-tw": " And number two, which was veryimportant for me to learn, and amazing, and surprisingfor me to learn, was that we were not includingthe true heroes who should be fighting for themselves. The women in the villages had no ideawe were fighting for them in the streets.", "en": " 第二個原因是，這點對我的學習非常重要， 令我很驚訝，訝異地去學習， 我們並沒有把真正的英雄納入團隊 那些會為自己挺身而出的人。 村莊的婦女們不曉得我們站在街上是為她們而戰。"}, {"zh-tw": " Every time I would go back, I would find my cousins and friendswith scarves on their faces, and I would ask, \"What happened?\" And they'd be like, \"Our husbands beat us.\" But we are working in the streets for you!

It was devastating -- like, oh,we can't actually do something about this? And we found out there's a huge gap when it comes to official policiesand the real truth on the ground.", "en": " 國家的政策 不總是必然地影響部落及農村社區。 這是驚人的，像是我們真的無法對此事做些改變？ 我們發現有一個很大的差異 這差異來自官方的政策與以真理為理由之間的差異。"}, {"zh-tw": " So this time, we were like,we are going to do something different. We are going to use strategy, and we are going to go back and apologize.", "en": " 所以這一次，我們做了和以往不同的事。 我們運用策略， 我們要回去並且道歉。"}, {"zh-tw": " Yes, apologize. We went back to the communities and we said we are very ashamed of what we did.", "en": " 是的，道歉。 我們回到社區 並且說我們為所做所為感到可恥。"}, {"zh-tw": " We are here to apologize, and in fact,we are here to make it up to you.

Nobody believed us.", "en": " 也就是音樂，語言和刺繡。 沒人相信我們。"}, {"zh-tw": " Nobody wanted to work with us. It took a lot of convincingand discussions with these communities until they agreed that we are goingto promote their language by making a booklet of their stories,fables and old tales in the tribe, and we would promote their music by making a CD of the songsfrom the tribe, and some drumbeating.", "en": " 沒有人要和我們一起執行。 在社區裡經過許多的說服和討論 直到他們同意我們是要推廣他們的語言 製作一本有關於他們故事的手冊神話、部落的古老傳說， 再來要推廣音樂 製作部落的音樂光碟，和一些宣傳廣告，"}, {"zh-tw": " And the third, which was my favorite, was we would promote their embroideryby making a center in the village where women would come every dayto make embroidery. And so it began.", "en": " 再來第三項，也是我最喜歡的， 就是在村莊成立一個中心推廣刺繡 婦女每天來這裡刺繡。 所以就這樣開始。"}, {"zh-tw": " We worked with one village,and we started our first center. It was a beautiful day.", "en": " 我們從一個村莊開始，並以它為起始點。 在一個天氣晴朗的日子。"}, {"zh-tw": " We started the center. Women were coming to make embroidery, and going through a life-changingprocess of education, learning about their rights,what Islam says about their rights, and enterprise development,how they can create money, and then how they can createmoney from money, how they can fight the customsthat have been destroying their lives from so many centuries, because in Islam, in reality, women are supposed to beshoulder to shoulder with men.", "en": " 我們啟動這個中心。 婦女們來這裡刺繡， 透過教育的程序來改變生活， 來了解她們的權利，伊斯蘭教賦予和承認她們的權利. 和企業發展，她們如何開闢財源， 如何以錢去賺錢， 如何打破幾世紀來破壞她們生活 的風俗習慣， 因為在伊斯蘭國家，現實生活中， 女人應該要與男人齊心協力地。"}, {"zh-tw": " Women have so much statusthat we have not been hearing, that they have not been hearing, and we needed to tell themthat they need to know where their rights areand how to take them by themselves, because they can do it and we can't. So this was the model which actuallycame out -- very amazing.", "en": " 女人佔有相當重要的地位那是她們從未聽過的， 她們從未聽過的， 我們必須要告訴她們她們必須要知道 她們的權利是什麼如何自行使用權利， 因為她們可以做，但是我們不行。 這即是將實現的模型真是太奇妙了。"}, {"zh-tw": " Through embroiderywe were promoting their traditions. We went into the village.We would mobilize the community.", "en": " 透過刺繡我們提升他們的傳統思考。 我們深入村莊。我們動員社區。"}, {"zh-tw": " We would make a center insidewhere 30 women will come for six months to learn aboutvalue addition of traditional embroidery, enterprise development,life skills and basic education, and about their rightsand how to say no to those customs and how to stand as leadersfor themselves and the society. After six months, we would connectthese women to loans and to markets where they can becomelocal entrepreneurs in their communities.", "en": " 我們設立一個中心站裡面有 30 個婦女 學習六個月的傳統刺繡的附加價值， 企業發展，生活技能和基本教育， 還有她們的權利，如何向那些惡性習俗說不 如何為自己以及社會站出來成為領導者。 六個月之後，我們連絡這些婦女去貸款，去做行銷 成為社區裡的本地企業家。"}, {"zh-tw": " We soon called this project Sughar. Sughar is a local word usedin many, many languages in Pakistan.", "en": " 很快地，我們稱這個計劃為「蘇葛」。 「蘇葛」是一種方言在巴基斯坦的很多語言有使用到。"}, {"zh-tw": " It means skilled and confident women. I truly believe, to create women leaders,there's only one thing you have to do: Just let them know that they havewhat it takes to be a leader.", "en": " 它意思是有技能，有自信的女人。 我真的相信，成為女性領導者只必須做一件事： 就是讓他們了解，她們有怎樣才能成為一個領導者的想法。"}, {"zh-tw": " These women you see here, they have strong skillsand potential to be leaders. All we had to do was removethe barriers that surrounded them, and that's what we decided to do.", "en": " 你所看到的這些女人， 她們有強大的技能有潛力成為領導者。 我們所要做的事是除去困住她們的障礙， 這是我們決定要做的事。"}, {"zh-tw": " But then while we were thinkingeverything was going well, once again everything was fantastic, we found our next setback: A lot of men started seeingthe visible changes in their wife. She's speaking more,she's making decisions -- oh my gosh, she's handling everything in the house.", "en": " 我們想如果事情進行順利的話， 一切事情再次進行順利， 我們發現下一個難題： 許多男性開始察覺到他們妻子明顯的改變。 他們的妻子說更多的話，也做決策-- 喔天啊！妻子在家裡主導一切。"}, {"zh-tw": " They stopped themfrom coming to the centers, and this time, we were like,okay, time for strategy two. We went to the fashion industry in Pakistan and decided to do researchabout what happens there.", "en": " 男性會阻止妻子成為家庭核心， 這時，我們高興地，好，是使用策略二的時候。 我們到到巴基斯坦的時尚圈 決定去研究那裡發生了什麼事情。"}, {"zh-tw": " Turns out the fashion industry in Pakistanis very strong and growing day by day, but there is less contributionfrom the tribal areas and to the tribal areas, especially women. So we decided to launch our first evertribal women's very own fashion brand, which is now called Nomads.", "en": " 結果是巴基斯坦的時尚界非常蓬勃且一天天地成長， 但很少來自部落的貢獻 特別是部落的婦女。 所以我們決定展開我們第一次部落婦女的時尚品牌， 稱為「游牧民族」。"}, {"zh-tw": " And so women started earning more, they started contributing morefinancially to the house, and men had to think againbefore saying no to them when they were coming to the centers. Thank you, thank you.", "en": " 所以婦女開始賺更多錢， 婦女開始對家庭貢獻更多的金錢。 男人必須再想想當他們反對女人 到中心學習。 謝謝，謝謝。"}, {"zh-tw": " In 2013, we launched our firstSughar Hub instead of a center. We partnered with TripAdvisor and created a cement hallin the middle of a village and invited so many other organizationsto work over there.", "en": " 在 2013 年，開辦第一個「蘇葛」中心取代一個中心。 我們與「到到網」合作 在村莊的中心點建一個水泥大廳 邀請很多公司組織來這裡進駐。"}, {"zh-tw": " We created this platformfor the nonprofits so they can touch and workon the other issues that Sughar is not working on, which would be an easy place for them to give trainings, use it as a farmer school,even as a marketplace, and anything they want to use it for, and they have been doing really amazingly. And so far, we have been ableto support 900 women in 24 villages around Pakistan.", "en": " 我們以非營利的方式建立這個平台 他們可以接觸或從事 「蘇葛」沒有涉及到的業務， 這是一個提供教育訓練的好地坊方， 可以當作是農夫學校，甚至是作為市集用途， 可以作為任何用途的場所， 他們已做的相當出色。 到目前為止，已經資助九百個婦女 遍及巴基斯坦的 24 個村莊。"}, {"zh-tw": " But that's actually not what I want. My dream is to reach outto one million women in the next 10 years, and to make sure that happens, this year we launchedSughar Foundation in the U.S.", "en": " 但這不是我真正想要的成果。 我的夢想是 10 年內資助一百萬個婦女， 以確保夢想可以達成。 今年我們在美國成立「蘇葛」基金會。"}, {"zh-tw": " It is not just going to fund Sugharbut many other organizations in Pakistan to replicate the idea and to find even more innovative ways to unleash the rural women'spotential in Pakistan. Thank you so much.", "en": " 這不只是要為「蘇葛」募款並且可以在巴基斯坦 的其他組織複製這個構想 去發現更多的創新方法 去發覺巴基斯坦農村婦女的潛能。 非常感謝。"}, {"zh-tw": " Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

It's incredible that someoneso young could do achieve this much through so much force and ingenuity.", "en": " 我的意思是，這個故事，從許多方面來說，似乎令人難以置信。 有人在如此年輕時透過影響力和足智多謀 能夠做到這麼多這是令人難以置信。"}, {"zh-tw": " So I guess one question: This is a spectacular dream to reach outand empower a million women -- how much of the current success depends on you, the force of this magnetic personality?

I can't teach how to do it, becausethere are so many different ways.", "en": " 所以我想了一個問題： 要達成這個偉大的夢想使一百萬個婦人擁有權力-- 目前的成功有多大的程度取決於你， 人格魅力的影響力？ 是如何展開行動的？ 哈立達·布羅希：我想我的工作是紿予靈感， 讓我完成夢想。 我無法教導如何去做，因為有太多不同的方法。"}, {"zh-tw": " We have been experimentingwith three ways only.
