So I studied her mammogram, and I reviewed the radiology literature, and I was shocked to discover that, in her case, our chances of finding a tumor early on the mammogram were less than the toss of a coin.

In a study funded by over 25 million taxpayer dollars, digital mammography was found to be no better over all than traditional mammography, and in fact, it was worse in older women. But it was better in one group, and that was women under 50 who were pre-menopausal and had dense breasts, and in those women, digital mammography found twice as many cancers, but it still only found 60 percent.", "en": " 為此，美國政府投資了 四十億美元 將乳房X光攝影術的儀器進行更新 而這項投資到底帶給了我們什麼好處? 在一個花了納稅人2500萬美元的研究中顯示 數位乳房X光攝影術 整體而言並沒有比 傳統的乳房X光攝影術來的好 事實上，它對年長女性的檢測能力甚至更糟 但是數位乳房X光攝影 針對五十歲以下的女性檢測能力較傳統的好 而她們通常是停經期前且有著高密度乳房的女性 在這些女性中 數位乳房X光攝影術比起傳統攝影術更加有效 但成功診斷的機率仍只有60%"}, {"zh-tw": " So digital mammography has been a giant leap forward for manufacturers of digital mammography equipment, but it's been a very small step forward for womankind. What about ultrasound? Ultrasound generates more biopsies that are unnecessary relative to other technologies, so it's not widely used.", "en": " 所以數位乳房X光攝影 對於相關的儀器製造商 可說是大有貢獻 . 但是對女性整體而言 其幫助可說是微乎其微 那麼超音波呢? 比起其他檢測方法 超音波需要更多的生物檢體 因此鮮少被使用"}, {"zh-tw": " And MRI is exquisitely sensitive for finding tumors, but it's also very expensive.

But this technology could not find tumors when they're small, and finding a small tumor is critical for survival.", "en": " 但是其中一項潛在的優勢是 伽瑪射線不像X光 並不會受到乳房密度的影響 但是伽馬射線 無法在腫瘤還很小就偵測到 但是及早發現小腫瘤對於病患的存活率是很重要的"}, {"zh-tw": " If you can find a tumor when it's less than a centimeter, survival exceeds 90 percent, but drops off rapidly as tumor size increases.

I was at a conference of 60,000 people in breast-imaging last week in Chicago, and I was stunned that there was a heated debate as to whether we should be telling women what their breast density is.", "en": " 康乃狄克州是第一個，也是目前唯一一個州 規定女性在接受乳房X光攝影後 其檢測報告應包含乳房密度 . 上周我與六萬人共同參加了一場 在芝加哥所舉辦的關於乳房攝影的研討會 而我非常訝異於其中一項爭議性的討論 也就是是否應該告訴女性 她們的乳房密度"}, {"zh-tw": " Of course we should.
