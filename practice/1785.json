And part of the reasonI love it is that every time people go into my buildings that are wood, I notice they reactcompletely differently.", "en": " 但是木頭是我最喜愛的材料， 讓我告訴你關於木頭的故事。 我喜愛木頭的其中一個原因是 每當有人走進我建造的木造建築時， 我發現他們的反應完全不同。"}, {"zh-tw": " I've never seen anybody walkinto one of my buildings and hug a steel or a concrete column, but I've actually seenthat happen in a wood building. I've actually seenhow people touch the wood, and I think there's a reason for it.", "en": " 我沒看過有人走進我的任何一棟建築裡， 擁抱鋼或是混凝土製的柱子， 但是這樣的事卻會發生在木造建築中。 我親眼見到人們是如何碰觸木頭， 我想他們這麼做是有原因的。"}, {"zh-tw": " Just like snowflakes,no two pieces of wood can ever be the same anywhere on Earth. That's a wonderful thing.", "en": " 就像雪花一樣，世界上任何地方 都不可能有兩塊完全相同的木頭。 那是多麼美妙的事啊。"}, {"zh-tw": " I like to think that wood gives Mother Naturefingerprints in our buildings. It's MotherNature's fingerprints that make our buildings connect us to naturein the built environment.", "en": " 我喜歡這樣想，木頭在我們的建築裡 留下大自然指紋。 它是大自然的指紋， 讓我們身在建築環境裡時，能夠透過建築與自然連結。"}, {"zh-tw": " Now, I live in Vancouver, near a forest that grows to 33 stories tall.

Even building codes actually limitthe ability for us to build much taller than fourstories in many places, and that's true here in the United States.", "en": " 但是我們想得到目前在世界上大部分地區的木頭建築 通常都只有四層樓高。 即使在許多地方的建築法規 對建物的高度限制遠高於四層樓， 在美國也是如此。"}, {"zh-tw": " Now there are exceptions, but there needs to be some exceptions, and things are goingto change, I'm hoping. And the reason I think that way is that today half of us live in cities, and that number is goingto grow to 75 percent.", "en": " 現在有許多例外， 但是我們需要有更多的例外， 我希望未來能改變。 我會這樣想是因為 現在我們有一半以上的人口住在城市裡， 而且之後比例將會成長至百分之七十五。"}, {"zh-tw": " Cities and density mean that our buildings are going to continue to be big, and I think there's a rolefor wood to play in cities.

One cubic meter of wood will store one tonne of carbon dioxide.", "en": " 但是如果你把木頭放在一棟建築、 一件傢俱或一個木製玩具中， 它就會具有神奇的能力 來儲存碳，讓我們與碳隔離。 一立方公尺的木頭能夠儲存 一噸的二氧化碳。"}, {"zh-tw": " Now our two solutionsto climate are obviously to reduce our emissions and find storage. Wood is the only majormaterial building material I can build with that actuallydoes both those two things.", "en": " 現在我們在氣候上的兩個解決方法， 顯然是降低排放量並找到儲存處。 木頭是唯一一種我所運用的建材中， 能夠同時做到這兩件事的建材。"}, {"zh-tw": " So I believe that we have an ethic that the Earth grows our food, and we need to moveto an ethic in this century that the Earth should grow our homes. Now, how are we going to do that when we're urbanizing at this rate and we think about woodbuildings only at four stories? We need to reduce the concreteand steel and we need to grow bigger,and what we've been working on is 30-story tall buildings made of wood.", "en": " 因此我認為我們的慣例是 地球提供我們食物， 我們必須在這個世紀讓這個慣例改變為 讓地球建造我們家園。 如果我們認為木造建築只能蓋四層樓， 在這樣高度都市化的現代， 我們該怎麼辦？ 我們需要減少使用混凝土和鋼筋，而且我們應該要 種植更高大的樹木， 目前我們已經設計了三十層樓高的木造建築。"}, {"zh-tw": " We've been engineeringthem with an engineer named Eric Karsh who works with me on it, and we've been doing this new work because there are new wood productsout there for us to use, and we call them mass timber panels.

That's what people jumpto as a conclusion.", "en": " 我發現我形容這個東西最好的方式就是 當我們想到木頭的時候， 我們都會用二乘四的建築法。 這是人們言之過早的結論。"}, {"zh-tw": " Two-by-four constructionis sort of like the little eight-dot bricks of Legothat we all played with as kids, and you can make all kindsof cool things out of Lego at that size, and out of two-by-fours. But do remember when you were a kid, and you kind of siftedthrough the pile in your basement, and you found that big24-dot brick of Lego, and you were kind of like, \"Cool, this is awesome. I canbuild something really big, and this is going to be great.\" That's the change.", "en": " 二乘四構造有點像是 我們小時候都會玩的那種小小的、有八個點的樂高積木， 你可以用樂高做成任何大小的酷炫成品， 用二乘四的構造。 但是要記得，當你還小的時候 你可能翻遍了地下室， 然後發現有更大的二十四個點的樂高玩具， 你覺得還不賴， 「酷耶，這超讚。我可以做一個更大的東西， 一定超厲害的。」 這成了改變的契機。"}, {"zh-tw": " Mass timber panelsare those 24-dot bricks. They're changing the scaleof what we can do, and what we've developedis something we call FFTT, which is a Creative Commons solution to building a very flexible system of building with these largepanels where we tilt up six stories at a time if we want to.", "en": " 巨型木材合板就是那個有二十四個點的積木。 它改變了我們可以創造的規模， 我們研發了一種叫 FFTT 的東西， 是一種共享創意的方法， 我們用它來建造彈性很大的建築系統， 我們可以隨心所欲，用這個巨型合板 一口氣建造出六層樓高的建築。"}, {"zh-tw": " This animation shows youhow the building goes together in a very simple way, but thesebuildings are available for architects and engineersnow to build on for different cultures in the world, different architecturalstyles and characters. In order for us to build safely, we've engineered thesebuildings, actually, to work in a Vancouver context, where we're a high seismic zone, even at 30 stories tall.", "en": " 這個動畫顯示出這些建築如何用很簡單的方式組合。 這些建築方式現在也已開放給 建築師和工程師來建造 房屋給世界上不同的文化社群， 不同的建築風格和樣貌。 為了安全地建造， 我們其實已經在高地震帶的溫哥華 我們其實已經在高地震帶的溫哥華 我們其實已經在高地震帶的溫哥華 設計三十層樓高的建築。"}, {"zh-tw": " Now obviously, every time I bring this up, people even, you know, hereat the conference, say, \"Are you serious? Thirty stories?How's that going to happen?\" And there's a lot of reallygood questions that are asked and important questionsthat we spent quite a long time working on the answersto as we put together our report and the peer reviewed report. I'm just going to focus on a few of them, and let's start with fire,because I think fire is probably the first one that you'reall thinking about right now.", "en": " 顯然，每次我把這個提出來， 即使是在這個大會裡的人都會說： 「你是認真的嗎？三十層樓？這怎麼可能成真？」 我們被問到許多很好也很重要的問題， 因此我們花了很長的時間 來處理這些問題，然後放在報告裡， 然後讓議會審閱報告。 我先談其中的幾個部分， 首先是關於火災， 我想每個人最先想到的都會是火災的問題。"}, {"zh-tw": " Fair enough. And the way I describe it is this.", "en": " 這很正常。 讓我以此來說明。"}, {"zh-tw": " If I asked you to takea match and light it and hold up a log and tryto get that log to go on fire, it doesn't happen, right?We all know that. But to build a fire, you kindof start with small pieces of wood and you work your way up, and eventually you canadd the log to the fire, and when you do add the logto the fire, of course, it burns, but it burns slowly.", "en": " 如果我請你點燃一根火柴， 然後請你試著讓木頭著火， 這很難辦到吧？這個道理我們都知道。 要起火你必須要從 小片的木頭開始點燃， 最後你就可以把木頭加進火裡， 加了木頭後， 當然就會開始燒，但是會燒得很慢。"}, {"zh-tw": " Well, mass timber panels,these new products that we're using, are much like the log. It's hard to start themon fire, and when they do, they actually burnextraordinarily predictably, and we can use fire sciencein order to predict and make these buildingsas safe as concrete and as safe as steel.", "en": " 嗯，這些我們用的巨型木材合板 就很像木頭。 很難點燃，而且當它著火後， 其實很容易預料它會怎麼燒。 我們可以運用消防學來預測， 讓這些建築就像混凝土 和鋼筋做的一樣安全。"}, {"zh-tw": " The next big issue, deforestation. Eighteen percent of our contribution to greenhouse gas emissions worldwide is the result of deforestation.", "en": " 另一個較大的問題是森林砍伐。 全世界所排放的溫室氣體中 有百分之十八 是由於森林砍伐。"}, {"zh-tw": " The last thing we wantto do is cut down trees. Or, the last thing we want to dois cut down the wrong trees.", "en": " 砍樹是我們最不想做的事， 應該說，我們最不想做的是砍錯了樹。"}, {"zh-tw": " There are models for sustainable forestry that allow us to cut trees properly, and those are the only trees appropriate to use for these kinds of systems. Now I actually think that these ideas will change the economicsof deforestation.", "en": " 的確有一些可持續砍伐林地， 讓我們可以適當地砍樹。 而那些是唯一適合 運用在這些系統中的樹材。 其實我認為這些想法 將會改變伐木業的經濟狀況。"}, {"zh-tw": " In countries with deforestation issues, we need to find a way to provide better value for the forest and actually encouragepeople to make money through very fast growth cycles -- 10-, 12-, 15-year-old treesthat make these products and allow us to build at this scale. We've calculated a 20-story building: We'll grow enough wood in NorthAmerica every 13 minutes.", "en": " 針對有砍伐森林問題的國家， 我們要找到一個方式 幫助森林創造更大的價值， 並且實際鼓勵人們 透過快速的生長週期來賺錢—— 十、十二或十五年生的樹木能用來製作這些產品， 而且可以讓我們建造這樣大規模的建築物。 我們計算過一棟二十層樓高的建物： 只要每十三分鐘在北美種植的樹木就足夠了，"}, {"zh-tw": " That's how much it takes. The carbon story hereis a really good one.", "en": " 只要這麼多就夠了。 在這裡碳足跡是很好的問題。"}, {"zh-tw": " If we built a 20-story buildingout of cement and concrete, the process would resultin the manufacturing of that cement and 1,200tonnes of carbon dioxide. If we did it in wood, in this solution, we'd sequester about 3,100 tonnes, for a net difference of 4,300 tonnes.", "en": " 如果我們用鋼筋水泥建造二十層樓高的建築物， 水泥的整個製造過程會產生 一千二百噸的二氧化碳。 如果我們用木頭來建造，用同樣的算式， 還能吸收三千一百噸的二氧化碳， 這可是四千三百噸的差別。"}, {"zh-tw": " That's the equivalent of about 900 cars removed from the road in one year. Think back to that three billion people that need a new home, and maybe thisis a contributor to reducing.", "en": " 相當將九百輛汽車 從公路上移開一整年。 回頭想想那三十億人， 他們需要一個新的家， 也許這是減少碳排放量的好方式。"}, {"zh-tw": " We're at the beginningof a revolution, I hope, in the way we build, because thisis the first new way to build a skyscraperin probably 100 years or more.

It just happens to be that MotherNature holds the patent, and we don't really feelcomfortable with it.", "en": " 我們選擇這裡是因為它是科技大學， 我相信木頭在科技上是 最先進的材質，讓我能運用在建築中。 這恰好是大自然持有的專利， 我們只是不太能接受而已。"}, {"zh-tw": " But that's the way it should be, nature's fingerprintsin the built environment.
