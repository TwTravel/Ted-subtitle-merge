There was this equation in my family that went something like this: if you are intelligent, you therefore are not spiritual.", "en": " 我把這兩個性格一個叫“神秘家” 一個叫“戰士” 我從小生在一個 在政治上活躍 無神論的家庭裏。 家裏有以下的認知： 你如果有智慧 那你就不該相信靈性的東西。"}, {"zh-tw": " I was the freak of the family. I was this weird little kid who wanted to have deep talks about the worlds that might exist beyond the ones that we perceive with our senses.", "en": " 我是家裏的怪胎 我是一個怪小孩 喜歡深入地探討 這個我們感觸不到 但是可能存在的世界。"}, {"zh-tw": " I wanted to know if what we human beings see and hear and think is a full and accurate picture of reality. So, looking for answers, I went to Catholic mass.", "en": " 我想知道 我們人類 所看所聼所想的 是不是跟事實的真相 一模一樣？ 爲了找尋答案 我去了參加天主教的彌撒"}, {"zh-tw": " I tagged along with my neighbors. I read Sartre and Socrates.", "en": " 我跟著我的鄰居一起去的。 我讀沙特和蘇格拉底。"}, {"zh-tw": " And then a wonderful thing happened when I was in high school: Gurus from the East started washing up on the shores of America. And I said to myself, \"I wanna get me one of them.\" And ever since, I've been walking the mystic path, trying to peer beyond what Albert Einstein called \"the optical delusion of everyday consciousness.\" So what did he mean by this? I'll show you.", "en": " 後來發生了一件美妙的事： 在我高中的時候 從東方來的精神導師 開始來到了美國。 我跟我自己說 “我也想跟一個導師學習。” 從此以後 我就走上探索神秘靈性的道路 試著去窺探 超越那個愛因斯坦所謂的 “日常生活意識的 光學幻象”。 他這麽說是什麽意思？接下來我會告訴你"}, {"zh-tw": " Take a breath right now of this clear air in this room. Now, see this strange, underwater, coral reef-looking thing? It's actually a person's trachea, and those colored globs are microbes that are actually swimming around in this room right now, all around us.", "en": " 大家先吸一口 這禮堂裏清淨的空氣。 現在，看看這裡這個奇怪的 像是水底下 珊瑚礁的東西？ 這事實上是人的氣管末梢分支。 還有這些彩色的像泥巴的東西 是微生物 他們懸浮在空氣間 此時此刻，就在我們的身邊。"}, {"zh-tw": " If we're blind to this simple biology, imagine what we're missing at the smallest subatomic level right now and at the grandest cosmic levels. My years as a mystic have made me question almost all my assumptions.", "en": " 如果光對這簡單的生物學我們都看不出來 那麽去想想 在最小的原子和最大的宇宙之間 我們看不到的東西有多少？ 我追尋靈性的過程中 讓我對所有的假設 都產生疑問。"}, {"zh-tw": " They've made me a proud I-don't-know-it-all.

She's worried.", "en": " 她很關心 現時當下的世間發生的大小事。 她很擔心"}, {"zh-tw": " She says, \"Excuse me, I'm pissed off, and I know a few things, and we better get busy about them right now.\" I've spent my life as a warrior, working for women's issues, working on political campaigns, being an activist for the environment. And it can be sort of crazy-making, housing both the mystic and the warrior in one body.", "en": " 她說，“對不起，我很不高興 我是知道一些事的， 而且我們最好現在就認真地來處理這些事。” 我這一輩子活得像一個戰士 為女性議題來奮戰 從事政治活動 也還是環保運動的活躍分子。 在我的體内 有神祕家和戰士共存 這看起來是聼瘋狂的。"}, {"zh-tw": " I've always been attracted to those rare people who pull that off, who devote their lives to humanity with the grit of the warrior and the grace of the mystic -- people like Martin Luther King, Jr., who wrote, \"I can never be what I ought to be until you are what you ought to be. This,\" he wrote, \"is the interrelated structure of reality.\" Then Mother Teresa, another mystic warrior, who said, \"The problem with the world is that we draw the circle of our family too small.\" And Nelson Mandela, who lives by the African concept of \"ubuntu,\" which means \"I need you in order to be me, and you need me in order to be you.\" Now we all love to trot out these three mystic warriors as if they were born with the saint gene.", "en": " 有少數的特種個性的人 深深地吸引著我 這種人能在競賽中勝出， 將他們的生命奉獻給人類 還有著戰士般的膽量 和神秘家的優雅-- 像馬丁路德金 他曾寫過，“在你沒成爲 你該成爲的人之前， 我也無法成爲 我該成爲的人。“ 他寫道，”這就是 有著交錯盤結結構的現實。“ 泰瑞沙修女，另一個神秘的戰士 她說，“這世界的問題 皆起因于我們把家庭的範圍 定義得太小。” 曼德拉 他按照一種非洲的觀念在生活 “烏班圖（ubuntu）” 意思是沒有了你 我就無法成爲我， 而你也需要我，來成就你自己。 我們都很喜歡誇讚 這三個神秘的戰士 他們好像與生俱來 都有聖人的基因。"}, {"zh-tw": " But we all actually have the same capacity that they do, and we need to do their work now.

That was Adolf Hitler's first title for \"Mein Kampf\" -- \"My Struggle\" -- the book that launched the Nazi party. The worst eras in human history, whether in Cambodia or Germany or Rwanda, they start like this, with negative other-izing.", "en": " 這跟下面的這本書的標題聼起來很類似 但是知道作者的話你們會大吃一驚： “四年半的 對抗謊言、愚昧 及對抗懦弱的抗爭。” 這是誰寫的？ 這是希特勒寫的 “Mein Kamp(我的奮鬥)”的原先標題 就是這本書策動了納粹黨。 人類最黑暗的歷史時期裏 不管在柬埔寨、德國 或是盧安達 都是從負面地分化你我開始"}, {"zh-tw": " And then they morph into violent extremism.

Maybe that person who worships at the mosque, or the church or the synagogue, down the street.", "en": " 要是請以上這些人吃午餐的想法 讓你胃口盡失 我建議你可以從身邊做起 因爲我們永遠有很多“對手” 就在你的左右。 這個人 可能是去清真寺禮拜的回教徒； 或是猶太教徒；"}, {"zh-tw": " Or someone from the other side of the abortion conflict.

A couple of weeks ago, I took a Conservative Tea Party woman to lunch.", "en": " 或者生活方式讓你害怕的人； 或是那個論調會讓你 氣得七竅生煙的人； 幾個星期前 我請一個茶葉黨的女士去吃午餐"}, {"zh-tw": " Now on paper, she passed my smoking ears test. She's an activist from the Right, and I'm an activist from the Left.", "en": " 看看報紙上她的言論，是夠讓我七竅生煙的。 她是右派的活躍分子 我是左派的活躍分子"}, {"zh-tw": " And we used some guidelines to keep our conversation elevated, and you can use them too, because I know you're all going to take an Other to lunch. So first of all, decide on a goal: to get to know one person from a group you may have negatively stereotyped.", "en": " 我們約定了一些原則 使我們的談話能愉快地進行 你們也可以套用這些原則， 因爲我知道 你們也都會跟“對手”去吃午餐。 首先，決定一個目標： 你要去認識一個 刻板印象十分負面的團體裏面的一個人。"}, {"zh-tw": " And then, before you get together, agree on some ground rules. My Tea Party lunchmate and I came up with these: don't persuade, defend or interrupt.", "en": " 再來，見面以前 先講好一些規則。 我跟那個茶葉黨女士 是這麽約定的： 不去說服、答辯 或打斷對方。"}, {"zh-tw": " Be curious; be conversational; be real. And listen.", "en": " 要對對方有好奇心 要維持會話的進行，還要真誠 還有注意傾聽。"}, {"zh-tw": " From there, we dove in. And we used these questions: Share some of your life experiences with me.", "en": " 我們從這幾個點切入。 我們問了這樣的問題： 請跟我分享你的一些經驗。"}, {"zh-tw": " What issues deeply concern you? And what have you always wanted to ask someone from the other side? My lunch partner and I came away with some really important insights, and I'm going to share just one with you. I think it has relevance to any problem between people anywhere.", "en": " 有什麽議題 讓你十分牽挂？ 有什麽問題是你一直想問 對方陣營的嗎？ 吃完午餐後， 我的午餐伴和我得到了一些啓示 我現在要來跟你們分享。 因爲我覺得這跟世上 任何人、任何問題 都有關。"}, {"zh-tw": " I asked her why her side makes such outrageous allegations and lies about my side. \"What?\" she wanted to know.", "en": " 我問她，為什麽她的陣營 捏造出這些不實的指控和謊言 加諸在我們這邊。 “譬如說呢？”她想知道。"}, {"zh-tw": " \"Like we're a bunch of elitist, morally-corrupt terrorist-lovers.\" Well, she was shocked. She thought my side beat up on her side way more often, that we called them brainless, gun-toting racists, and we both marveled at the labels that fit none of the people we actually know.", "en": " “像，我們是一票 道德淪喪，又喜歡恐怖分子的 精英分子。” 她十分的震驚 她以爲我們更常 放話攻擊他們， 像，我們說他們沒大腦 是崇拜槍支的種族主義者。 我們兩邊都很吃驚 因爲這些標簽 跟我們認識的對方 完全不符合。"}, {"zh-tw": " And since we had established some trust, we believed in each other's sincerity. We agreed we'd speak up in our own communities when we witnessed the kind of \"otherizing\" talk that can wound and fester into paranoia and then be used by those on the fringes to incite.", "en": " 因爲我們互相建立起了一些信任 我們相信對方的誠意。 我們同意下一次 在自己的陣營裏聽到 這種分化人們的言論時 要出言制止 因爲這類的言論會傷人 製造偏執，而進而被偏激分子 用來煽動人群。"}, {"zh-tw": " By the end of our lunch, we acknowledged each other's openness. Neither of us had tried to change the other.", "en": " 在午餐結束的時候 我們互相肯定了對方開誠佈公的態度 我們沒有試著要去改變對方。"}, {"zh-tw": " But we also hadn't pretended that our differences were just going to melt away after a lunch. Instead, we had taken first steps together, past our knee-jerk reactions, to the ubuntu place, which is the only place where solutions to our most intractable-seeming problems will be found.", "en": " 我們也沒有假裝說 吃一頓午餐後，我們之間的差異 就可以煙消雲散。 我們各往前邁了一部 放下了以前立即反擊的 反射性保衛 來到烏班圖（ubuntu）的境界 這也是唯一一個 互動良好 能夠找到解決問題的方法 的地方。"}, {"zh-tw": " Who should you invite to lunch? Next time you catch yourself in the act of otherizing, that will be your clue. And what might happen at your lunch? Will the heavens open and \"We Are the World\" play over the restaurant sound system? Probably not.", "en": " 那麽，你該邀誰來午餐？ 下一囘你發現自己 把他人當作非我族類時 這就是個很好的指標。 所以，你吃完這頓午餐後有什麽會改變？ 天堂的門會大開 餐廳的音響還會同時播放“四海一家”嗎？ 大概不會。"}, {"zh-tw": " Because ubuntu work is slow, and it's difficult. It's two people dropping the pretense of being know-it-alls.", "en": " 因爲要達到烏班圖的過程是漫長的 也是十分困難的。 這需要兩個人 同時放下 “我什麽都知道”的成見。"}, {"zh-tw": " It's two people, two warriors, dropping their weapons and reaching toward each other.
