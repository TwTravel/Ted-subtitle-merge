Now, to assist me in explaining this, I've enlisted the help of one of our greatest philosophers, the reigning king of the metaphorians, a man whose contributions to the field are so great that he himself has become a metaphor.", "en": " 但譬喻是一種思考的方式再轉化爲文字 爲了説明這點 我找來一位偉大的哲學家協助 他是譬喻領域的國王 他對譬喻的貢獻之大 使得他自己 也成為一個譬喻"}, {"zh-tw": " I am, of course, referring to none other than Elvis Presley. Now, \"All Shook Up\" is a great love song.", "en": " 我指的，當然，不作他人想 是貓王艾維斯·普利斯萊 神魂顛倒（按：也作”上下搖動“解）“是一首經典情歌"}, {"zh-tw": " It's also a great example of how whenever we deal with anything abstract -- ideas, emotions, feelings, concepts, thoughts -- we inevitably resort to metaphor. In \"All Shook Up,\" a touch is not a touch, but a chill.", "en": " 同時也是一個相當好的例子 當我們要描述抽象的事物 想法、情緒、感覺、概念、思想 無可避免地我們會用到譬喻 在”神魂顛倒“裏，觸摸不是觸摸，而是一陣冷顫"}, {"zh-tw": " Lips are not lips, but volcanoes. She is not she, but a buttercup.", "en": " 嘴唇不是嘴唇，而是火山 她不是她，而是金鳳花"}, {"zh-tw": " And love is not love, but being all shook up.

Because we instinctively find, or create, a pattern between the round shape and the round sound of Bouba, and the spiky shape and the spiky sound of Kiki.

And they had those expectations because agent metaphors imply the deliberate action of a living thing pursuing a goal.", "en": " 是因爲擬人化的譬喻暗示 大多覺得未來股價會繼續上揚 他們之所以會這麽覺得 是因爲擬人化的譬喻暗示了 生物追求一個目標的行動"}, {"zh-tw": " If, for example, house prices are routinely described as climbing and climbing, higher and higher, people might naturally assume that that rise is unstoppable.
