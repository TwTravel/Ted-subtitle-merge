So passwords are something that I hear a lot about.", "en": " 我是卡內基美隆大學(Carnegie Mellon)電腦科學及工程的教授 我研究的專長是有用的隱私權和安全性 所以我的朋友們喜歡提供我一些例子 使用電腦系統時遇到的挫折 尤其是 碰到不能用的隱私權和安全性 密碼就是常見的例子"}, {"zh-tw": " A lot of people are frustrated with passwords, and it's bad enough when you have to have one really good password that you can remember but nobody else is going to be able to guess. But what do you do when you have accounts on a hundred different systems and you're supposed to have a unique password for each of these systems? It's tough.", "en": " 很多人對密碼設定感到挫折 尤其是 當你需要一組很好用的密碼 你自己記得住 但沒人猜的到 但當你好幾個帳戶 都在不同的系統環境上 而每個帳戶都要有個獨特的密碼 你要怎麼辦呢？ 那不容易"}, {"zh-tw": " At Carnegie Mellon, they used to make it actually pretty easy for us to remember our passwords. The password requirement up through 2009 was just that you had to have a password with at least one character.", "en": " 卡內基美隆大學 過去設定密碼很簡單 我們很容易記住 到2009年以前 密碼設定只要求 至少一個字元"}, {"zh-tw": " Pretty easy. But then they changed things, and at the end of 2009, they announced that we were going to have a new policy, and this new policy required passwords that were at least eight characters long, with an uppercase letter, lowercase letter, a digit, a symbol, you couldn't use the samecharacter more than three times, and it wasn't allowed to be in a dictionary. Now, when they implemented this new policy, a lot of people, my colleagues and friends, came up to me and they said, \"Wow, now that's really unusable.", "en": " 非常簡單 但後來他們改變了規則 到了2009年底 他們公布了一項新規定 新規定要求 密碼至少要有八個字元 包括一個大寫字母 一個小寫字母 一個數字 一個符號 相同字元不能超過三次 不可是字典查得到的 現在他們實施新規定 我的同事 朋友 還有很多人 告訴我 說: 哇 現在真的變得好難用"}, {"zh-tw": " Why are they doing this to us, and why didn't you stop them?\" And I said, \"Well, you know what? They didn't ask me.\" But I got curious, and I decided to go talk to the people in charge of our computer systems and find out what led them to introduce this new policy, and they said that the university had joined a consortium of universities, and one of the requirements of membership was that we had to have stronger passwords that complied with some new requirements, and these requirements were that our passwords had to have a lot of entropy. Now entropy is a complicated term, but basically it measures the strength of passwords.", "en": " 他們為何這麼做 妳怎麼不阻止他們？ 我說: 你知道嗎？ 他們沒問我 可我也很好奇 所以決定要跟那些 管理我們電腦系統的人談談 了解到底什麼原因 讓他們導入這新政策 他們說卡內基美隆大學 加入了大學聯盟 成為會員的條件包括 提高密碼的安全性 好符合新的規定 新規定要求密碼 必須要有很多熵值 現在這熵值是個很複雜的名詞 基本上它可衡量密碼的強度"}, {"zh-tw": " But the thing is, there isn't actually a standard measure of entropy. Now, the National Instituteof Standards and Technology has a set of guidelines which have some rules of thumb for measuring entropy, but they don't have anything too specific, and the reason they only have rules of thumb is it turns out they don't actually have any good data on passwords.", "en": " 可事實上 熵值沒有衡量的標準 現在 國家標準與技術研究所 有整套指引 指引裡有一些經驗法則 用於測量熵值 但他們沒有什麼太具體的東西 他們會只有經驗法則 因為他們其實沒有很精確的 密碼數據"}, {"zh-tw": " In fact, their report states, \"Unfortunately, we do not have much data on the passwords userschoose under particular rules. NIST would like to obtain more data on the passwords users actually choose, but system administratorsare understandably reluctant to reveal password data to others.\" So this is a problem, but our research group looked at it as an opportunity.", "en": " 實際上他們的報告指出： 不幸的是我們數據不多 特別是 密碼使用者在特定規則下選擇密碼 NIST想獲得更多 使用者選擇密碼的資料 但系統管理員當然不願意 透露密碼資料給其他人 所以這是個問題 但我們的研究小組 視它作為一個機會"}, {"zh-tw": " We said, \"Well, there's a needfor good password data. Maybe we can collect some good password data and actually advance the state of the art here.", "en": " 我們說 好的密碼資料是有必要的 也許我們可以收集一些好的密碼資料 有助於提昇技術現況"}, {"zh-tw": " So the first thing we did is, we got a bag of candy bars and we walked around campus and talked to students, faculty and staff, and asked them for information about their passwords. Now we didn't say, \"Give us your password.\" No, we just asked them about their password.", "en": " 所以 我們做的第一件事是 我們拿了一包糖果 在校園裡 跟學生 教師和工作人員解釋 並跟他們要求取得 關於他們設定密碼的資訊 我們並不是說 請給我們您的密碼 我們只是詢問"}, {"zh-tw": " How long is it? Does it have a digit? Does it have a symbol? And were you annoyed at having to create a new one last week? So we got results from 470 students, faculty and staff, and indeed we confirmed that the new policy was very annoying, but we also found that people said they felt more secure with these new passwords. We found that most people knew they were not supposed towrite their password down, and only 13 percent of them did, but disturbingly, 80 percent of people said they were reusing their password.", "en": " 他們的密碼多長？有一個數字嗎？ 有一個符號嗎？ 上星期要重設的新密碼 會不會讓你覺得很煩？ 因此 我們得到了來自470位 學生 教師和工作人員的回饋 事實上我們也證實了新的政策 實在令人討厭 但我們也發現 有人說 他們認為這些新密碼更安全 我們發現大多數人都知道 不應該把密碼寫下來 而其中只有13％的人有把密碼寫下來 但令人不安的是 80％的人表示他們重複使用他們的密碼"}, {"zh-tw": " Now, this is actually more dangerous than writing your password down, because it makes you muchmore susceptible to attackers. So if you have to, write your passwords down, but don't reuse them.", "en": " 這其實比寫下密碼 來得更危險 因為你更容易受到駭客攻擊 所以 必要時寫下密碼 但不要重複使用"}, {"zh-tw": " We also found some interesting things about the symbols people use in passwords. So CMU allows 32 possible symbols, but as you can see, there's only a small number that most people are using, so we're not actually getting very much strength from the symbols in our passwords.", "en": " 我們還發現了一些有趣的事情 關於密碼中的符號 CMU允許使用的符號有32個 但正如你所見 只有少數符號 常常被使用 所以實際上 我們密碼也沒有變得更強 因為密碼裡有了符號"}, {"zh-tw": " So this was a really interesting study, and now we had data from 470 people, but in the scheme of things, that's really not very much password data, and so we looked around to see where could we find additional password data? So it turns out there are a lot of people going around stealing passwords, and they often go and post these passwords on the Internet. So we were able to get access to some of these stolen password sets.", "en": " 這是一個非常有趣的研究 現在我們有470人的資料 但對這項計劃而言 這些數據不算多 所以我們想周圍 那裡可以找到更多密碼資料？ 後來我們發現 原來有很多人 到處去竊取密碼 然後在網路上 發佈這些密碼 我們取得 其中一些被盜的密碼"}, {"zh-tw": " This is still not really ideal for research, though, because it's not entirely clear where all of these passwords came from, or exactly what policies were in effect when people created these passwords. So we wanted to find some better source of data.", "en": " 雖然這對研究來說不是很理想 因為我們不清楚 這些密碼從哪裡來 還是他們設密碼時 採取了什麼樣的策略 因此 我們希望找到較好的資料來源"}, {"zh-tw": " So we decided that one thing we could do is we could do a study and have people actually create passwords for our study. So we used a service calledAmazon Mechanical Turk, and this is a service where you can post a small job online that takes a minute, a few minutes, an hour, and pay people, a penny, ten cents, a few dollars, to do a task for you, and then you pay them through Amazon.com.", "en": " 所以我們發現可以做一件事 我們打算展開研究計畫 讓人們實際來設定密碼 我們使用了\"亞馬遜機器游牧民族\"提供的服務 這是一種群眾外包服務平台 在那裡 你可以張貼微型線上工作資訊 只需要幾分種 一小時就能完成 然後付些錢 給幫你完成工作的人 然後透過Amazon.com付費給他們"}, {"zh-tw": " So we paid people about 50 cents to create a password following our rules and answering a survey, and then we paid them again to come back two days later and log in using their password and answering another survey. So we did this, and we collected 5,000 passwords, and we gave people a bunch of different policies to create passwords with.", "en": " 我們一共付了約50分美元 讓人根據我們的規則 設立密碼 並回答問卷 然後 再付給他們一筆錢請他們兩天後回來 用他們的密碼登錄 再回答另一份問卷 就這樣我們收集了5,000個密碼 要求他們依不同規則 設立密碼"}, {"zh-tw": " So some people had a pretty easy policy, we call it Basic8, and here the only rule was that your password had to have at least eight characters. Then some people had a much harder policy, and this was very similar to the CMU policy, that it had to have eight characters including uppercase, lowercase, digit, symbol, and pass a dictionary check.", "en": " 有些人的規則很簡單 我們叫它Basic8 它只要求 密碼至少有八個字元 有些人的規則就比較困難 跟卡內基美隆大學的作法很像 它必須有8個字元 包括大寫 小寫 數字 符號 並通過字典檢查"}, {"zh-tw": " And one of the other policies we tried, and there were a whole bunch more, but one of the ones we tried was called Basic16, and the only requirement here was that your password hadto have at least 16 characters. All right, so now we had 5,000 passwords, and so we had much more detailed information.", "en": " 我們試過其中的規則之一 並還有更多 但其中一種稱為Basic16 唯一的要求是 密碼至少有16個字元 所以現在我們有5,000個密碼 還有詳細的資訊"}, {"zh-tw": " Again we see that there's only a small number of symbols that people are actually using in their passwords. We also wanted to get an idea of how strong the passwords were that people were creating, but as you may recall, there isn't a good measure of password strength.", "en": " 我們又看到 只有少數的符號 被使用在密碼中 我們也希望知道 人們設立的密碼的強度 但你可能還記得 還沒有一個很好的 衡量密碼強度的方法"}, {"zh-tw": " So what we decided to do was to see how long it would take to crack these passwords using the best cracking tools that the bad guys are using, or that we could find information about in the research literature. So to give you an idea of how bad guys go about cracking passwords, they will steal a password file that will have all of the passwords in kind of a scrambled form, called a hash, and so what they'll do is they'll make a guess as to what a password is, run it through a hashing function, and see whether it matches the passwords they have ontheir stolen password list.", "en": " 所以我們決定要看看 使用駭客用的破解工具 或是使用 我們在文獻可以找的到的資訊 需要多長時間 來破解這些密碼 因此 讓你們來看看駭客 如何破解密碼 他們竊取密碼檔案 這檔案中的密碼 呈現混亂形式 稱為散列 他們會用猜測的方式 來猜測密碼 再用散列函數程式跑過 看是否能在他們偷來的密碼中 找到相同密碼"}, {"zh-tw": " So a dumb attacker will try every password in order. They'll start with AAAAA and move on to AAAAB, and this is going to take a really long time before they get any passwords that people are really likely to actually have.", "en": " 所以 一個愚蠢駭客會將密碼一個一個順序試 從AAAAA開始 到AAAAB 這要花很長的時間 才能得到有可能 人們真正設置的密碼"}, {"zh-tw": " A smart attacker, on the other hand, does something much more clever. They look at the passwords that are known to be popular from these stolen password sets, and they guess those first.", "en": " 另一方面 一個聰明的駭客 作法就聰明些 他們猜測密碼時 先試 從這些偷來的密碼組中 常用的密碼"}, {"zh-tw": " So they're going to start by guessing \"password,\" and then they'll guess \"I love you,\" and \"monkey,\" and \"12345678,\" because these are the passwords that are most likely for people to have. In fact, some of you probably have these passwords.", "en": " 因此 他們要開始猜測“密碼”時 他們會先猜 “我愛你” 和 “猴子” 和“12345678” 因為這些密碼 是最多人用 事實上 你們可能也有這些密碼"}, {"zh-tw": " So what we found by running all of these 5,000 passwords we collected through these tests to see how strong they were, we found that the long passwords were actually pretty strong, and the complex passwords were pretty strong too. However, when we looked at the survey data, we saw that people were really frustrated by the very complex passwords, and the long passwords were a lot more usable, and in some cases, they were actually even stronger than the complex passwords.", "en": " 所以 我們發現 用我們收集的5,000個密碼 用這些測試 看看他們的強度是如何 我們發現 長密碼通常強度很高 而複雜的密碼也相當強 然而 當我們看到這調查數據 我們看到人們對非常複雜的密碼 很有挫折感 長的密碼會實用很多 在某些情況下 他們比複雜密碼更強"}, {"zh-tw": " So this suggests that, instead of telling people that they need to put all these symbols and numbers and crazy things into their passwords, we might be better off just telling people to have long passwords. Now here's the problem, though: Some people had long passwords that actually weren't very strong.", "en": " 這告訴我們 比較好是告訴人們使用長密碼 而不是告訴人們 他們要把這些符號和數字 和瘋狂的東西 放進自己的密碼中 現在 有個問題： 有些人有長密碼 但其實並不是很強"}, {"zh-tw": " You can make long passwords that are still the sort of thing that an attacker could easily guess. So we need to do more thanjust say long passwords.", "en": " 你可以有長的密碼 仍是那些 駭客可以很容易地猜到的密碼 所以我們需要的不只是長密碼"}, {"zh-tw": " There has to be some additional requirements, and some of our ongoing research is looking at what additional requirements we should add to make for stronger passwords that also are going to be easy for people to remember and type. Another approach to getting people to have stronger passwords is to use a password meter.", "en": " 還有一些其他的要求 我們正在進行的一些研究 是在尋找應該加入什麼樣的要求 讓密碼強度更高 並且很容易 讓人記住和輸入 讓人們設置強度高密碼的另一種方法 是使用一個密碼強度測量表"}, {"zh-tw": " Here are some examples. You may have seen these on the Internet when you were creating passwords.", "en": " 下面是一些例子 當你在網路上設立密碼時 你可能已經看過這些"}, {"zh-tw": " We decided to do a study to find out whether these password meters actually work. Do they actually help people have stronger passwords, and if so, which ones are better? So we tested password meters that were different sizes, shapes, colors, different words next to them, and we even tested one that was a dancing bunny.", "en": " 我們決定做研究找出 這些密碼強度測量表是否真的有用 它們是否真的 有助於設立強的密碼 若有的話 哪個更好？ 所以我們在密碼旁 加入不同的大小 形狀 顏色的 密碼強度測量表 我們甚至用一個跳舞的兔子"}, {"zh-tw": " As you type a better password, the bunny dances faster and faster. So this was pretty fun.", "en": " 當你輸入一個較好的密碼 兔子會跳舞跳得越來越快 這很有趣"}, {"zh-tw": " What we found was that password meters do work. Most of the password meters were actually effective, and the dancing bunny was very effective too, but the password meters that were the most effective were the ones that made you work harder before they gave you that thumbs up and said you were doing a good job, and in fact we found that most of the password meters on the Internet today are too soft.", "en": " 我們發現 密碼強度測量表真的有用 大部分的密碼測量表都真的有效 跳舞的兔子也很有效 最有效的密碼測量表 再給你大拇指讚之前 告訴你做的好之前 你已做了很多工做 而事實上 我們發現 目前網路上大部分的 測量表都太弱"}, {"zh-tw": " They tell you you're doing a good job too early, and if they would just wait a little bit before giving you that positive feedback, you probably would have better passwords. Now another approach to better passwords, perhaps, is to use pass phrases instead of passwords.", "en": " 他們都太早告訴你 你做的好 在給你的正面回饋之前 他們只要再等久一點點 你可能就會有更好的密碼 另一種更好地設密碼的方法 就是使用密語 而不是密碼"}, {"zh-tw": " So this was an xkcd cartoon from a couple of years ago, and the cartoonist suggests that we should all use pass phrases, and if you look at the second row of this cartoon, you can see the cartoonist is suggesting that the pass phrase \"correct horse battery staple\" would be a very strong pass phrase and something really easy to remember. He says, in fact, you've already remembered it.", "en": " 所以這是一個幾年前的XKCD卡通 漫畫家建議我 們都應該使用密語 如果你看這部動畫片的第二行 可以看到漫畫家建議 密語 “正確的馬電池主食” 是一個非常強密語 也很容易記住 他說 事實上 你已經記住了"}, {"zh-tw": " And so we decided to do a research study to find out whether this was true or not. In fact, everybody who I talk to, who I mention I'm doing password research, they point out this cartoon.", "en": " 所以我們決定做一個研究 看這是真還是假 事實上 我們訪問的對象 當我們提到是做密碼的研究 他們提到這部動畫片"}, {"zh-tw": " \"Oh, have you seen it? That xkcd. Correct horse battery staple.\" So we did the research study to see what would actually happen.", "en": " “你看過那XKCD嗎？ 正確的馬電池主食\" 所以我們做了調查研究 看看到底會發生什麼"}, {"zh-tw": " So in our study, we used Mechanical Turk again, and we had the computer pick the random words in the pass phrase. Now the reason we did this is that humans are not very good at picking random words.", "en": " 研究中 我們再次使用群眾外包平台 我們讓電腦隨機 在密語中選字 我們這樣做的原因是 人類不是很會"}, {"zh-tw": " If we asked a human to do it, they would pick things that were not very random. So we tried a few different conditions.", "en": " 隨機選字 如果我們找人來做 他們挑的都不是很隨機 因此 我們嘗試了一些不同的情況"}, {"zh-tw": " In one condition, the computer picked from a dictionary of the very common words in the English language, and so you'd get pass phrases like \"try there three come.\" And we looked at that, and we said, \"Well, that doesn't really seem very memorable.\" So then we tried picking words that came from specific parts of speech, so how about noun-verb-adjective-noun. That comes up with somethingthat's sort of sentence-like.", "en": " 在其中一種情況下 電腦從字典選出 英文很常見的字 所以你可能會有 “試那兒三來” 的密語 我們看了說 這似乎不是很好記 於是當我們嘗試 在演說中的特定部分來選字 就像名詞 動詞 形容詞 名詞 我們得到像句子的東西"}, {"zh-tw": " So you can get a pass phrase like \"plan builds sure power\" or \"end determines red drug.\" And these seemed a little bit more memorable, and maybe people would like those a little bit better. We wanted to compare them with passwords, and so we had the computerpick random passwords, and these were nice and short, but as you can see, they don't really look very memorable.", "en": " 這樣你就可以得到一個密語 像是 \"計畫建造肯定力量\" 或是 \"結束決定紅色藥\" 而這些似乎比較容易記住 也許人們會比較喜歡一點 我們希望將它們與密碼進行比較 所以我們用電腦挑隨機密碼 這些都是又短又好 但你會發現 他們看起來不好記"}, {"zh-tw": " And then we decided to try something called a pronounceable password. So here the computer picks random syllables and puts them together so you have something sort of pronounceable, like \"tufritvi\" and \"vadasabi.\" That one kind of rolls off your tongue.", "en": " 後我們決定嘗試一種叫做 可發音密碼 這是電腦隨機挑選的音節 並把它們放在一起 你得到這樣好像讀得出來的東西 “tufritvi”和“vadasabi” 又有點讓舌頭打結"}, {"zh-tw": " So these were random passwords that were generated by our computer. So what we found in this study was that, surprisingly, pass phrases were not actually all that good.", "en": " 這些都是電腦產生的 隨機密碼 我們在這項研究發現是 驚訝的是 密語實際上不是那麼好"}, {"zh-tw": " People were not really better at remembering the pass phrases than these random passwords, and because the pass phrases are longer, they took longer to type and people made more errors while typing them in. So it's not really a clear win for pass phrases.", "en": " 人們記密語 并不比隨機密碼記得更好 並且因為密語較長 需要較長的時間來輸入 輸入時容易出錯 所以密語不會比較好"}, {"zh-tw": " Sorry, all of you xkcd fans. On the other hand, we did find that pronounceable passwords worked surprisingly well, and so we actually are doing some more research to see if we can make thatapproach work even better.", "en": " xkcd的粉絲們 抱歉了 在另一方面 我們確實發現 那可發音密碼 出奇地好用 所以我們正在做一些調查研究 看看我們是否可以讓這方法做得更好"}, {"zh-tw": " So one of the problems with some of the studies that we've done is that because they're all done using Mechanical Turk, these are not people's real passwords. They're the passwords that they created or the computer created for them for our study.", "en": " 我們已經做的一些研究中 有一個問題就是 因為這些研究 都是在群眾外包平台上執行 這些都不是人們的真正密碼 這些是為研究而創造的密碼 或者為電腦產生的密碼"}, {"zh-tw": " And we wanted to know whether people would actually behave the same way with their real passwords. So we talked to the informationsecurity office at Carnegie Mellon and asked them if we couldhave everybody's real passwords.", "en": " 而我們想知道 是否實際上人們具有相同的行為方式 來設定他們的真實密碼 因此 我們請卡內積梅隆的資訊安全辦公室 為我們提供大家的真實密碼"}, {"zh-tw": " Not surprisingly, they were a little bit reluctant to share them with us, but we were actually able to work out a system with them where they put all of the real passwords for 25,000 CMU students, faculty and staff, into a locked computer in a locked room, not connected to the Internet, and they ran code on it that we wrote to analyze these passwords. They audited our code.", "en": " 不出意外 他們是有點不願意 與我們分享 但是我們共同想出 一個辦法 他們用來儲存 CMU25,000個學生，教師，和員工真實密碼的系統 放在一台鎖碼的電腦里 鎖在教室 沒有網路連線 他們操作我們所寫的代碼 來分析密碼"}, {"zh-tw": " They ran the code. And so we never actually saw anybody's password.", "en": " 他們審核我們的代碼 他們跑這些代碼 所以我們並沒真正看到 任何人的密碼"}, {"zh-tw": " We got some interesting results, and those of you Tepper students in the back will be very interested in this. So we found that the passwords created by people affiliated with theschool of computer science were actually 1.8 times stronger than those affiliated with the business school.", "en": " 我們得到了一些有趣的結果 那些在後面的太普學生 都會對此很感興趣 我們發現 電腦科學學院學生密碼 比那些商學院學生的密碼 要強1.8倍"}, {"zh-tw": " We have lots of other really interesting demographic information as well. The other interesting thing that we found is that when we comparedthe Carnegie Mellon passwords to the Mechanical Turk-generated passwords, there was actually a lot of similarities, and so this helped validate our research method and show that actually, collecting passwords using these Mechanical Turk studies is actually a valid way to study passwords.", "en": " 我們有很多其他的真的很有趣 人口統計資訊 另一個有趣的事情 當我們比較 卡內基梅隆和群眾外包平台生成的密碼 實際上存在很多的相似之處 所以這有助於驗證我們的研究方法 並顯示 實際上 群眾外包平台收集的密碼 對我們的研究很有效"}, {"zh-tw": " So that was good news. Okay, I want to close by talking about some insights I gained while on sabbatical last year in the Carnegie Mellon art school.", "en": " 所以這是個好消息 好吧 我想用下面所說的來做總結 一些我去年在卡內基·梅隆藝術學校 公休時獲得的啟發"}, {"zh-tw": " One of the things that I did is I made a number of quilts, and I made this quilt here. It's called \"Security Blanket.\" And this quilt has the 1,000 most frequent passwords stolen from the RockYou website.", "en": " 其中一個我做的事就是 我做了一些拼布棉被 這是我在這裡做的 叫做 \"安全性毯子\" 這棉被上有RockYou網站上公布的 1000個 最常被偷的密碼"}, {"zh-tw": " And the size of the passwords is proportional to how frequently they appeared in the stolen dataset.
