We add Japan to it.", "en": " 你看，日本是那樣往上走的 我們把日本放進來"}, {"zh-tw": " And there is no doubt that fast catch up can take place. Can you see here what Japan did? Japan did it like this, until full catch up, and then they follow with the other high-income economies.", "en": " 我們可以看到：快速的發展 是有可能發生的 你看到日本了嗎？ 日本是這樣發展的，一直到完全趕上 接下來還一直跟高所得國家齊頭並進"}, {"zh-tw": " But the real projections for those ones, I would like to give it like this. Can be worse, can be better.", "en": " 但是如果真要預測這些國家的未來走勢 我傾向用這個 有可能更好，也有可能更壞"}, {"zh-tw": " It's always difficult to predict, especially about the future. Now, a historian tells me it's even more difficult to predict about the past.", "en": " 要預測什麽總是難的，尤其是關於未來 可是，一個歷史學家告訴我，預測過去還要更困難"}, {"zh-tw": " I think I'm in a difficult position here.

Will the former rich countries really accept a completely changed world economy, and a shift of power away from where it has been the last 50 to 100 to 150 years, back to Asia? And will Asia be able to handle that new position of being in charge of being the most mighty, and the governors of the world? So, always avoid war, because that always pushes human beings backward.", "en": " 但是我真正擔心的是戰爭 有錢的國家真的可以接受 一個完全改變的世界經濟嗎？ 他們可以接受過去50、100年、 150年間享有的權力 被亞洲奪回嗎？ 又，亞洲能夠處理 它的新地位 作為世界第一強權統理世界嗎？ 所以，一定要避免戰爭 因爲戰爭總是使人類文明往後退"}, {"zh-tw": " Now if these inequalities, climate and war can be avoided, get ready for a world in equity, because this is what seems to be happening. And that vision that I got as a young student, 1972, that Indians can be much better than Swedes, is just about to happen.", "en": " 如果這些貧富不均、氣候、和戰爭問題能避免的話 我們將可以準備迎接一個平等的世界 因爲這些是看起來即將要發生的事 而這個1972年我還在做學生時洞察到的看法 印度人會比瑞典人還好 正在發生"}, {"zh-tw": " And it will happen precisely the year 2048 in the later part of the summer, in July, more precisely, the 27th of July. The 27th of July, 2048 is my 100th birthday.", "en": " 更精確地説 它會發生在2048年 夏天的尾聲，在七月 再更精確來説，七月二十七號 2048年7月27號 是我100歲的生日"}, {"zh-tw": " And I expect to speak in the first session of the 39th TED India.
