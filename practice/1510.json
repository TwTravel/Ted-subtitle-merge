Remember that? Y2K, the dotcom bubble, stressing about whose party you're going to go to as the clock strikes midnight, before the champagne goes flat, and then there's that inchoate yearning that was felt, I think, by many, that the millennium, that the year 2000, should mean more, more than just a two and some zeroes. Well, amazingly, for once, our world leaders actually lived up to that millennium moment and back in 2000 agreed to some pretty extraordinary stuff: visionary, measurable, long-term targets called the Millennium Development Goals.", "en": " 讓我們一起回想 回到你們記憶的深處 也許是在你們生命中最期待的一年 也可能是整個人類歷史上 備受期待的一年 就是西元2000年，記得嗎? 千禧年、網路泡沫化 煩惱著，在香檳走味之前 跨年倒數時分 到底該參加誰的派對? 還有一些未曾深思的渴望? 對很多人來說，千禧年 西元2000年，應該具有更多意義 不只是一個2跟幾個0 令人驚訝的，那些世界領袖們 難能可貴，在千禧年那時刻 在2000年同意了一些 非常特殊的事情 具有遠見的、可衡量的、長期的目標 所謂的（聯合國）千年發展目標"}, {"zh-tw": " Now, I'm sure you all keep a copy of the goals under your pillow, or by the bedside table, but just in case you don't, and your memory needs some jogging, the deal agreed then goes like this: developing countries promised to at least halve extreme poverty, hunger and deaths from disease, alongside some other targets, by 2015, and developed nations promised to help them get that done by dropping debts, increasing smart aid, and trade reform. Well, we're approaching 2015, so we'd better assess, how are we doing on these goals? But we've also got to decide, do we like such global goals? Some people don't. And if we like them, we've got to decide what we want to do on these goals going forward.", "en": " 我很確定你們都有一份 不是在你的枕頭下，就是在床頭櫃上 但萬一沒有 而你需要被提醒一下 這項協議就是： 發展中國家承諾戮力於幾項目標， 包括要在2015年前，將極端貧窮、飢餓 與因疾病造成的死亡減少一半 已開發國家承諾要來協助他們達到這個目標 透過勾銷債權 提升正確實惠的協助和貿易改革等手段 眼看2015年迫在眉睫 我們應該來評估一下，這些目標的進展如何 我們也該評斷，我們真的接受這些目標嗎? 有些人不接受。如果我們認同，我們應該決定接下來 我們應該怎麼執行這些目標?"}, {"zh-tw": " What does the world want to do together? We've got to decide a process by which we decide. Well, I definitely think these goals are worth building on and seeing through, and here's just a few reasons why.", "en": " 究竟整個世界想要做到的又是甚麼? 我們現在應該制定一個方法，來找出這個世界要什麼 我當然認為這些目標值得繼續執行和完成 這裡有一些理由"}, {"zh-tw": " Incredible partnerships between the private sector, political leaders, philanthropists and amazing grassroots activists across the developing world, but also 250,000 people marched in the streets of Edinburgh outside this very building for Make Poverty History. All together, they achieved these results: increased the number of people on anti-retrovirals, life-saving anti-AIDS drugs; nearly halved deaths from malaria; vaccinated so many that 5.4 million lives will be saved.", "en": " 私人機構、政治領袖和慈善家之間 不可思議的攜手合作 還有各發展中國家的 草根積極社運人士 還有二十五萬人在街頭遊行 就在愛丁堡，就在這棟建築外面 提倡「讓貧窮走入歷史」 大家一起達成了這些結果 增加抗逆轉過濾性病毒的人數 增加救命的抗愛滋藥物 死於瘧疾的人數減半 推廣疫苗注射使得5百40萬條生命免於死亡"}, {"zh-tw": " And combined, this is going to result in two million fewer children dying every year, last year, than in the year 2000. That's 5,000 fewer kids dying every day, ten times you lot not dead every day, because of all of these partnerships.", "en": " 這些努力加在一起 每一年可以挽救兩百萬個孩童的性命 去年，相較於2000年 每日死亡的孩童數目少了5千人 是在座聽眾人數的十倍 都是因為這些人的合作"}, {"zh-tw": " So I think this is amazing living proof of progress that more people should know about, but the challenge of communicating this kind of good news is probably the subject of a different TEDTalk. Anyway, for now, anyone involved in getting these results, thank you. I think this proved these goals are worth it.", "en": " 所以我覺得這些了不起的活生生的進步的證據 應該讓更多人知道 但是如何傳播這些好成績 可能是不同的TED Talk的主題 無論如何，現在，對投身這些目標促進這些結果產生的人們 我要說：謝謝你們，我想這證明了這些目標是值得的"}, {"zh-tw": " But there's still a lot of unfinished business. Still, 7.6 million children die every year of preventable, treatable diseases, and 178 million kids are malnourished to the point of stunting, a horrible term which means physical and cognitive lifelong impairment.", "en": " 但還有很多未完成的任務 每年還有七百六十萬名孩童 死於可預防、可治療的疾病 一億七千八百萬孩童營養不良 導致成長遲緩停滯，讓人痛心 這些是對身體和智力上終身的傷害"}, {"zh-tw": " So there's plainly a lot more to do on the goals we've got. But then, a lot of people think there are things that should have been in the original package that weren't agreed back then that should now be included, like sustainable development targets, natural resource governance targets, access to opportunity, to knowledge, equity, fighting corruption.", "en": " 因此，對於這些目標我們還有很長的一段路要走 然而，有些人認為，有些事 本來就應涵蓋在當時的目標裡的事情 現在更應該要考慮加進去 像是永續發展 自然資源的管理 機會平等，都有接受教育的機會 公平、打擊貪腐等"}, {"zh-tw": " All of this is measurable and could be in the new goals. But the key thing here is, what do you think should be in the new goals? What do you want? Are you annoyed that I didn't talk about gender equality or education? Should those be in the new package of goals? And quite frankly, that's a good question, but there's going to be some tough tradeoffs and choices here, so you want to hope that the process by which the world decides these new goals is going to be legitimate, right? Well, as we gather here in Edinburgh, technocrats appointed by the U.N. and certain governments, with the best intentions, are busying themselves designing a new package of goals, and currently they're doing that through pretty much the same old late-20th-century, top-down, elite, closed process.", "en": " 這些目標都是具體可衡量的、可以被加入到新目標之內 重點是 你認為哪些事情應該被包括在新的目標之內? 你想要甚麼? 當我沒提到性別平等或教育 你是否感到不滿意? 這些該納入新的目標裡嗎? 說實在的，這真是個好問題 我們將面對困難的妥協跟選擇， 所以你希望 世界能依循合法且合理的流程 來制定新目標? 然而，當我們現在聚集在愛丁堡演講 由聯合國指定的技術官僚和一些國家 正用心良苦 為設計新的目標而忙碌 但是他們是依照20世界末期慣見的 由上而下、精英領導的封閉式流程"}, {"zh-tw": " But, of course, since then, the Web and mobile telephony, along with ubiquitous reality TV formats have spread all around the world. So what we'd like to propose is that we use them to involve people from all around the world in an historic first: the world's first truly global poll and consultation, where everyone everywhere has an equal voice for the very first time.", "en": " 當然，那時起，網路、行動電話通訊 以及普遍存在的實境秀電視節目 已經遍佈全世界 因此，我們期望的是利用這些科技 讓全世界的人 參與這個「史上第一」 史上頭一遭全球意見調查及諮詢 每個角落的每個人都可以公平表達意見"}, {"zh-tw": " I mean, wouldn't it be a huge historic missed opportunity not to do this, given that we can? There's hundreds of billions of your aid dollars at stake, tens of millions of lives, or deaths, at stake, and, I'd argue, the security and future of you and your family is also at stake. So, if you're with me, I'd say there's three essential steps in this crowdsourcing campaign: collecting, connecting and committing.", "en": " 我是說，如果是能做卻不這麼做 難道不是歷史上的一大憾事? 我們討論的是大家所提供的數以千億元的金援 數以百萬計的人命的死活 甚至攸關你自己 和你家庭的未來 如果你認同我 「向世界公民徵詢」計畫運動有三個基本步驟 收集資料、集結群力和做出承諾"}, {"zh-tw": " So first of all, we've got to ground this campaign in core polling data. Let's go into every country that will let us in, ask 1,001 people what they want the new goals to be, making special efforts to reach the poorest, those without access to modern technology, and let's make sure that their views are at the center of the goals going forward.", "en": " 首先，我們必須以核心意見調查資料 做為本運動的基礎 讓我們進入每一個願意合作的國家 詢問一千零一人 他們期望中的新目標是甚麼? 特別努力接觸貧窮人家 那些沒有機會使用現代化科技的人 確保他們的想法成為這個目標的核心"}, {"zh-tw": " Then, we've got to commission a baseline survey to make sure we can monitor and progress the goals going forward. The original goals didn't really have good baseline survey data, and we're going to need the help of big data through all of this process to make sure we can really monitor the progress. And then we've got to connect with the big crowd.", "en": " 然後，進一步建立基線資料 以確保我們可以監管這些目標 並持續推進 原先的目標並沒有真正具備好的基線資料 在執行過程裡，我們會需要這些充分的資料 以確認我們真的能監督進度 然後我們要把廣大群眾結合起來"}, {"zh-tw": " Now here, we see the role for an unprecedented coalition of social media giants and upstarts, telecoms companies, reality TV show formats, gaming companies, telecoms, all of them together in kind of their \"We Are The World\" moment. Could they come together and help the Millennium Development Goals get rebranded into the Millennial Generation's Goals? And if just five percent of the five billion plus who are currently connected made a comment, and that comment turned into a commitment, we could crowdsource a force of 300 million people around the world to help see these goals through.", "en": " 現在，我看到空前的、非常大群的群體合作 包括社群媒體巨人、新興企業 電信公司、實境電視節目、遊戲廠商等 全部結合在一起 形成「我們是一個世界」的狀態 他們是否能一起合作 將「千年發展目標」 轉變為「千年世代的目標」? 如果已經互連的五十億人口中有百分之五 共同表達意見 而這些意見變成承諾 我們就可以集結這三億人口的群體力量 來協助完成計畫"}, {"zh-tw": " If we have this collected data, and this connected crowd, based upon our experience of campaigning and getting world leaders to commit, I think world leaders will commit to most of the crowdsourced recommendations. But the question really is, through this process will we all have become committed? And if we are, are we ready to iterate, monitor and provide feedback, make sure these promises are really delivering results? Well, there's some fantastic examples here to scale up, mostly piloted within Africa, actually.", "en": " 如果我們擁有這些集合資料，和這群聯結起來的民眾 依據我們的經驗 我們將可以使世界領袖們做出承諾 我想世界領袖們 願意為這些群眾建議做出承諾 但真正的問題是，經過這些流程 表示我們大家都同意了嗎? 如果是，我們準備好去再三重申、監督 和提供回覆 以確保這些承諾會有成果嗎? 這裡有些很棒的實例，很適合擴大規模 這些大多是在非洲的一些先驅測試計畫"}, {"zh-tw": " There's Open Data Kenya, which geocodes and crowdsources information about where projects are, are they delivering results. Often, they're not in the right place.", "en": " 有一個叫做”肯亞開放數據(Open Data Kenya)”的網路平台 裡面有關於各項援助專案所在，及其成效 全由當地民眾彙報訊息 通常，這些訊息不完全正確"}, {"zh-tw": " And Ushahidi, which means \"witness\" in Swahili, which geocodes and crowdsources information in complex emergencies to help target responses. This is some of the most exciting stuff in development and democracy, where citizens on the edge of a network are helping to force open the process to make sure that the big global aid promises and vague stuff up at the top really delivers for people at a grassroots level and inverts that pyramid.", "en": " Ushahidi這間公司 (Swahili語，意為眼見為憑) 透過當地民眾收集複雜的緊急狀況及地理位置訊息 幫助援助送到對的地方 這是發展和民主之中 最令人興奮的東西 這些位於邊陲地帶的人們 都在協助強力開放此流程 確保來自上層的大規模的的全球援助承諾 可以確實被傳遞到居於下層鄉村人民 逆轉形成了頭重腳輕的金字塔，"}, {"zh-tw": " This openness, this forcing openness, is key, and if it wasn't entirely transparent already, I should be open: I've got a completely transparent agenda. Long-term trends suggest that this century is going to be a tough place to live, with population increases, consumption patterns increasing, and conflict over scarce natural resources.", "en": " 這種開放，這種強制性開放就是關鍵 如果這還不夠完全的透明 我還要說：我還有完全透明的目的 根據長期的趨勢 這個世紀的生活環境將會更艱困 人口增加、消費擴張 爭奪稀有的自然資源"}, {"zh-tw": " And look at the state of global politics today. Look at the Rio Earth Summit that happened just last week, or the Mexican G20, also last week.", "en": " 看看今日的全球政局 看看上周才舉行的里約地球高峰會 還有同樣上周舉辦的墨西哥G20會議"}, {"zh-tw": " Both, if we're honest, a bust. Our world leaders, our global politics, currently can't get it done.", "en": " 這兩者，老實說都是失敗的 我們的世界領袖和全球政治 目前都無法把事做好"}, {"zh-tw": " They need our help. They need the cavalry, and the cavalry's not going to come from Mars. It's got to come from us, and I see this process of deciding democratically in a bottom-up fashion what the world wants to work on together as one vital means by which we can crowdsource the force to really build that constituency that's going to reinvigorate global governance in the 21st century.", "en": " 他們需要我們的幫忙，他們需要援兵 而這援兵不會天外飛來 是來自於我們 我看到這種是由下往上的民主過程是重要的工具 世界想要通力合作 要透過這工具真正集合群眾力量 真正在21世紀 重振 全球共同治理"}, {"zh-tw": " I started in 2000. Let me finish in 2030. Many people made fun of a big campaign a few years ago we had called Make Poverty History.", "en": " 這計畫我在2000年開始，將在2030年結束 幾年前，很多人嘲弄一個稱做 「讓貧窮走入歷史」的大型運動"}, {"zh-tw": " It was a naive thought in many people's minds, and it's true, it was just a t-shirt slogan that worked for the moment. But look. The empirical condition of living under a dollar and 25 is trending down, and look where it gets to by 2030.", "en": " 在很多人心裡那實在很天真 這也是事實 那不過是一句短命的T恤上的標語 但是，曾經只靠1點25美元生存的情況已經減少了 在2030年會達到甚麼地步"}, {"zh-tw": " It's getting near zero. Now sure, progress in China and India and poverty reduction there was key to that, but recently also in Africa, poverty rates are being reduced.", "en": " 它將幾乎快消失 現在肯定的是，中國及印度的貧窮減低的比率 將會是關鍵 最近連非洲的貧窮比率都在降低"}, {"zh-tw": " It will get harder as we get towards zero, as the poor will be increasingly located in post-conflict, fragile states, or maybe in middle income states where they don't really care about the marginalized. But I'm confident, with the right kind of political campaigning and creative and technological innovation combined working together more and more as one, I think we can get this and other goals done.", "en": " 數字越接近零，將會更困難 因為貧窮 會出現在戰爭過後、脆弱的地區 或著在中等收入的國家 並不太被在意被邊緣化的那些人 但我有信心，藉由正確的政治運動 和具有創意和科技化的創新 一起運作，同心同力 我想我們可以達到這個和其他的目標"}, {"zh-tw": " Thank you. Chris Anderson: Jamie, here's the puzzle to me.", "en": " 謝謝 詹姆，我有個問題"}, {"zh-tw": " If there was an incident today where a hundred kids died in some tragedy or where, say, a hundred kids were kidnapped and then rescued by special forces, I mean, it would be all over the news for a week, right?
