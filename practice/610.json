I found these little bits of glass.", "en": " 言歸正傳，說回那些玻璃。 我找來這些玻璃碎"}, {"zh-tw": " And I had to make them square. So I'm thinking \"How can I do this?\" So what I did, I got an oilstone. Broke the edge of an oilstone off.", "en": " 還得把它們弄得方方正正。 我當時想:「我如何才能做到呢?」 於是我找來一塊磨刀石，把邊角弄了一小片下來，"}, {"zh-tw": " And what I did, I took pieces of glass. And I started to rub them. I used a little tweezer which I made from a hair clip.", "en": " 然後我拿起玻璃碎在上面打磨， 我用的是一把由髮夾改造成的鑷子"}, {"zh-tw": " And I built rubber around the end of the tweezer so it wouldn't crush the glass.

And then pushing the glass in with its own friction.", "en": " 構建的方法 是先在釘頭上弄出坑紋 然後利用玻璃本身的摩擦力把它推進坑裡"}, {"zh-tw": " And as I was doing it, what happened? The instrument that I used turned into a catapult. And it went like this ...", "en": " 當我這樣做時，發生了甚麼事呢? 我用的工具成了投石器 屋子像這樣被彈走..."}, {"zh-tw": " And then that was it. Gone.", "en": " 就這樣 一去不回"}, {"zh-tw": " So I'm thinking, \"Mr. Huf isn't going to be very happy when I told him his house has gone to another, into the atmosphere somewhere.\" So to cut the story short, I decided that I had to go back and do it.

And I decided to, sort of, construct it very, very slowly, holding my breath, working between my heartbeat, and making sure everything is leveled.", "en": " 我心想:「Huf先生一定不會太高興 要是我告訴他他的房子 一飛沖天去了 長話短說 我決定重頭開始 於是我找來更多材料。今次我決定 很慢很慢地構建它 屏息靜氣，小心亦亦地工作 並確保一切都四平八穩。"}, {"zh-tw": " Because it's such a small sculpture, nothing can go wrong. And I decided to build it up.", "en": " 這個雕塑太細小了 實在不容有失 然後我決定著手搭建這屋子"}, {"zh-tw": " Then I used fibers out of my jumper, which I held and stretched. And made the beams going around the house.", "en": " 我拿毛衣上的纖維 把它們拉直 弄成房子外圍的樑"}, {"zh-tw": " And the actual windows and the balcony had to be sort of constructed. I used a money spider's web to actually attach certain things, which sent me insane.", "en": " 原屋的窗戶和露台 也需要構造出來 我用了一隻金錢蜘蛛的網 去作固定用途 這差點沒把我弄瘋"}, {"zh-tw": " But I managed to do it. And when I finished it, I came back the next day.", "en": " 不過我還是做到了 完成後的第二天，我回去一看"}, {"zh-tw": " I noticed that the house was occupied. Have we ever heard of a dust mite? Darren dust mite and his family moved in.", "en": " 發現那小屋已經有住客了 你們認識一隻塵蹣嗎? 塵蹣Darren舉家搬進來了"}, {"zh-tw": " So basically I'd completed the house.

I think they're arguing about the space on the pin.", "en": " 好，如你所見 Bart Simpson 正和它老爸爭執 我想他們在爭論針頭上的空間"}, {"zh-tw": " There's not enough room for the two of them.

So I have to be very quick.", "en": " 而且很快地變乾 所以我的行動要快"}, {"zh-tw": " If I'm not, it will end up looking not like what it's supposed to look like. It could end up looking like Humpty Dumpty or somebody else.", "en": " 要不然它最後看起來 便半點不像了 它可能落得一個矮胖子或者其他人的模樣"}, {"zh-tw": " So I have to be very very careful.
