But as we started asking ourselves about how we were addressing the higher needs of our employees and our customers, I realized we had no metrics.", "en": " 這三層的需求層次 其實跟馬斯洛的 五階層需求層次有關 可是當我們要著手衡量 員工和顧客的高階需求的時候 我才發現，我們沒有衡量標準。"}, {"zh-tw": " We had nothing that actually could tell us whether we were actually getting it right. So we started asking ourselves: What kind of less obvious metrics could we use to actually evaluate our employees' sense of meaning, or our customers' sense of emotional connection with us? For example, we actually started asking our employees, do they understand the mission of our company, and do they feel like they believe in it, can they actually influence it, and do they feel that their work actually has an impact on it? We started asking our customers, did they feel an emotional connection with us, in one of seven different kinds of ways.", "en": " 不知道怎樣衡量才是對的。 所以我們反問自己 還有什麼我們看不見的變數 可以用來實際地評估 員工的感覺 或是顧客跟我們的情感聯係度 舉例來說，我們問員工說 你們了解我們公司的服務宗旨嗎？ 你們認同我們的服務宗旨嗎？ 你們能為公司帶來任何改變嗎？ 你們真的覺得自己的工作對公司有影響嗎？ 我們也問顧客 是否覺得和我們有 七種程度不同的情感的聯係。"}, {"zh-tw": " Miraculously, as we asked these questions and started giving attention higher up the pyramid, what we found is we created more loyalty. Our customer loyalty skyrocketed.", "en": " 神奇的是，藉由問這些問題 還有漸漸注重金字塔頂端的需求後 我們竟然讓顧客的忠誠度提高了。 顧客對我們的忠誠度疾速攀升"}, {"zh-tw": " Our employee turnover dropped to one-third of the industry average, and during that five year dotcom bust, we tripled in size. As I went out and started spending time with other leaders out there and asking them how they were getting through that time, what they told me over and over again was that they just manage what they can measure.", "en": " 員工的離職律也降低到 產業平均的三分之一。 網路股泡沫化為期五年 那五年裡，我們的營業規模變為三倍。 之後我跟其他領導者聊天 問他們如何撐過那段時期 我聼到的都是 他們只管理有形的看得到的"}, {"zh-tw": " What we can measure is that tangible stuff at the bottom of the pyramid. They didn't even see the intangible stuff higher up the pyramid.", "en": " 他們能看到的就是金字塔底端 有形的資產 大家都沒看倒金字塔上層 無形的資產。"}, {"zh-tw": " So I started asking myself the question: How can we get leaders to start valuing the intangible? If we're taught as leaders to just manage what we can measure, and all we can measure is the tangible in life, we're missing a whole lot of things at the top of the pyramid. So I went out and studied a bunch of things, and I found a survey that showed that 94 percent of business leaders worldwide believe that the intangibles are important in their business, things like intellectual property, their corporate culture, their brand loyalty, and yet, only five percent of those same leaders actually had a means of measuring the intangibles in their business.", "en": " 所以我開始問自己 要如何讓大家重視無形的資產？ 如果大家跟企業家一樣，只管理能夠量化的 也就是人生中有形的資產 我們就會失去金字塔頂端的所有東西。 所以我繼續作了一些研究 發現一則調查顯示 百分之九十四的 企業領導者相信 對於自己的企業來說，無形資產是很重要的 包括智慧財產 企業文化、品牌忠誠度。 但是其中只有百分之五的企業主 真的有一套標準來衡量事業上無形的資產。"}, {"zh-tw": " So as leaders, we understand that intangibles are important, but we don't have a clue how to measure them. So here's another Einstein quote: \"Not everything that can be counted counts, and not everything that counts can be counted.\" I hate to argue with Einstein, but if that which is most valuable in our life and our business actually can't be counted or valued, aren't we going to spend our lives just mired in measuring the mundane? It was that sort of heady question about what counts that led me to take my CEO hat off for a week and fly off to the Himalayan peaks.", "en": " 跟企業主一樣，我們也知道 無形資產很重要 但是壓根不知道怎麼衡量無形資產。 愛因斯坦說 不是所有算的出來的東西都有意義 有意義的事情不一定算的出來。 我不想跟愛因斯坦爭論 但最有價值的東西 無論是人生中還是事業上 都算不清，也估不得 難道要任由生命陷在 對世俗東西的計算嗎？ 因爲對這量化的問題百思不解 讓我拋掉執行長的頭銜一個禮拜 飛到喜馬拉雅山區"}, {"zh-tw": " I flew off to a place that's been shrouded in mystery for centuries, a place some folks call Shangri-La. It's actually moved from the survival base of the pyramid to becoming a transformational role model for the world.", "en": " 這地方已經藏在神祕的面紗後好幾世紀了 就是人們口中香格里拉。 香格里拉就是從金字塔底部的生存層 轉型成功的例子 值得借鏡。"}, {"zh-tw": " I went to Bhutan. The teenage king of Bhutan was also a curious man, but this was back in 1972, when he ascended to the throne two days after his father passed away.", "en": " 我去了不丹 不丹的國王還是少年，頗具好奇心 在1972年 他的父親去世兩天後 不丹國王便登基"}, {"zh-tw": " At age 17, he started asking the kinds of questions that you'd expect of someone with a beginner's mind. On a trip through India, early in his reign as king, he was asked by an Indian journalist about the Bhutanese GDP, the size of the Bhutanese GDP.", "en": " 那時國王年僅17歲，他開始思考一些問題 一些聼起來像初學者的問題。 在他剛開始統治不丹的時候 有一次去印度拜訪 有個記者問國王 不丹的國内生産毛額 不丹的國内生産毛額有多少"}, {"zh-tw": " The king responded in a fashion that actually has transformed us four decades later. He said the following, he said: \"Why are we so obsessed and focused with gross domestic product? Why don't we care more about gross national happiness?\" Now, in essence, the king was asking us to consider an alternative definition of success, what has come to be known as GNH, or gross national happiness.", "en": " 國王的那時的囘答 影響了四十年後的我們。 國王說，我們為什麼那麼執意、 注重國内生産毛額 我們為什麼不多注意， 國内幸福毛額 事實上，國王要我們多想想 成功另外的定義 也就是後來的 GNH，或稱為國内幸福毛額。"}, {"zh-tw": " Most world leaders didn't take notice, and those that did thought this was just \"Buddhist economics.\" But the king was serious. This was a notable moment, because this was the first time a world leader in almost 200 years had suggested that intangible of happiness -- that leader 200 years ago, Thomas Jefferson with the Declaration of Independence -- 200 years later, this king was suggesting that intangible of happiness is something that we should measure, and it's something we should actually value as government officials.", "en": " 大多數的國家領導者都不注重GNH 或者認為這只是「佛教經濟學」 但國王卻很認真 這是重要的一刻 因為這是第一次 在近兩百年來 有領導人物提出 幸福的無形價值。 兩百年前也有領導者提過 那人就是提出「獨立宣言」的湯瑪斯傑弗遜 兩百年後 不丹王提出幸福的無形價值 正是我們該去衡量的 而且我們是應該要珍視的 身為政府官員，理應如此。"}, {"zh-tw": " For the next three dozen years as king, this king actually started measuring and managing around happiness in Bhutan -- including, just recently, taking his country from being an absolute monarchy to a constitutional monarchy with no bloodshed, no coup. Bhutan, for those of you who don't know it, is the newest democracy in the world, just two years ago.", "en": " 在他執政的三十六年中 確實去衡量 且提昇不丹的幸福指數。 不丹國王最近還把自己的國家 從絕對君主制變成君主立憲制 改革期間沒有傷亡，也沒有政變 對那些不太了解不丹的人來說 不丹是世上最年輕的民主國家，現在才兩歲。"}, {"zh-tw": " So as I spent time with leaders in the GNH movement, I got to really understand what they're doing. And I got to spend some time with the prime minister.", "en": " 我跟其他領導者參加GNH運動的時候 才真正了解他們在做什麼。 我跟首相處了一段時間"}, {"zh-tw": " Over dinner, I asked him an impertinent question. I asked him, \"How can you create and measure something which evaporates -- in other words, happiness?\" And he's a very wise man, and he said, \"Listen, Bhutan's goal is not to create happiness.", "en": " 晚宴時，問了首相一個很直接的問題 我問首相 「你們怎麼能創造、衡量 摸不到的東西 也就是『幸福』？」 首相非常有智慧，跟我說 我告訴你呀，不丹並不是要創造幸福"}, {"zh-tw": " We create the conditions for happiness to occur. In other words, we create a habitat of happiness.\" Wow, that's interesting.", "en": " 我們創造的是環境，讓幸福來臨的環境 也就是說，我們為幸福建造家園 哇！那可真有趣！"}, {"zh-tw": " He said that they have a science behind that art, and they've actually created four essential pillars, nine key indicators and 72 different metrics that help them to measure their GNH. One of those key indicators is: How do the Bhutanese feel about how they spend their time each day? It's a good question. How do you feel about how you spend your time each day? Time is one of the scarcest resources in the modern world.", "en": " 首相又說這藝術的背後，有著科學根據。 我們創造了四大項目 九個關鍵指標 七十二個單位 來計算國民幸福毛額 其實，其中一種關鍵指標就是 不丹人覺得 自己每天怎麼花時間的情況為何 這問題問的真好 你對自己每天花時間的情況覺得滿意嗎？ 時間這資源 對現代來說是極其珍貴的"}, {"zh-tw": " And yet, of course, that little intangible piece of data doesn't factor into our GDP calculations. As I spent my week up in the Himalayas, I started to imagine what I call an emotional equation.", "en": " 當然 這少量的無形資料 並不記入GDP的算式裡 在喜瑪拉雅山上的那七天 我開始構思 我所謂的情緒方程式。"}, {"zh-tw": " And it focuses on something I read long ago from a guy named Rabbi Hyman Schachtel. How many know him? Anybody? 1954, he wrote a book called \"The Real Enjoyment of Living,\" and he suggested that happiness is not about having what you want; instead, it's about wanting what you have.", "en": " 這方程式著重在很久以前讀的東西上 就是史查鐵的著作 有人知道這個人嗎？誰知道？ 史查鐵再1954年時寫了「人生真趣」 書中提到幸福 並不是擁有你想要的東西 而是珍惜你所有的。"}, {"zh-tw": " Or in other words, I think the Bhutanese believe happiness equals wanting what you have -- imagine gratitude -- divided by having what you want -- gratification. The Bhutanese aren't on some aspirational treadmill, constantly focused on what they don't have.", "en": " 換句話說，我覺得不丹人認為 幸福就是珍惜所有 想一下，“感激”除以 欲望 等於滿足 不丹人不是在跑步機上 不斷追尋自己沒有的。"}, {"zh-tw": " Their religion, their isolation, their deep respect for their culture and now the principles of their GNH movement all have fostered a sense of gratitude about what they do have.

We are a bottom-heavy culture in more ways than one.", "en": " 不丹人的信仰、孤立的情勢 對本土文化的崇高敬意 還有現在國内幸福毛額的原則 都讓不丹人感激 握在手中的東西。 我們在座有多少位TED會員 把時間花在 方程式的下半部，也就是分母上？ 我們的文化頭輕腳重 很多方面都是如此 笑聲"}, {"zh-tw": " The reality is, in Western countries, quite often we do focus on the pursuit of happiness as if happiness is something that we have to go out -- an object that we're supposed to get, or maybe many objects. Actually, in fact, if you look in the dictionary, many dictionaries define pursuit as to \"chase with hostility.\" Do we pursue happiness with hostility? Good question. But back to Bhutan.", "en": " 其實，西方國家的人 常常把追求幸福掛在嘴邊 好像幸福是在外頭 要去追求的東西或很多的東西。 其實，你查查字典 很多字典對「追求」的定義是 「帶著惡意追逐」 我們會帶著惡意追逐幸福嗎 好問題！回到不丹"}, {"zh-tw": " Bhutan's bordered on its north and south by 38 percent of the world's population. Could this little country, like a startup in a mature industry, be the spark plug that influences a 21st century of middle-class in China and India?

Just three days ago, three days ago here at TED, we had a simulcast of David Cameron, potentially the next prime minister of the UK, quoting one of my favorite speeches of all-time, Robert Kennedy's poetic speech from 1968 when he suggested that we're myopically focused on the wrong thing and that GDP is a misplaced metric.", "en": " 這是個品牌合作的機會。 三天前，就在TED這裡 有卡麥隆的聯播 卡麥隆是英國下任總理候選人 他引用了我最愛的演講之一 勞伯甘迺迪在1968年的演講中 提到我們太過短視 並注重在錯誤的事上 GDP就是其一"}, {"zh-tw": " So it suggests that the momentum is shifting.
