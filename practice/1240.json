I, as the conductor, have to come to the rehearsal with a cast-iron sense of the outer architecture of that music, within which there is then immense personal freedom for the members of the orchestra to shine.", "en": " 現在我們用更民主的觀點及方式來製作音樂─ 溝通是雙向的 我身為指揮，在排練時，必須對曲目的整體架構 抱著堅不可摧的信念 但在其中又要讓樂手能自由地發揮 讓他們在表演中綻放光芒"}, {"zh-tw": " For myself, of course, I have to completely trust my body language. That's all I have at the point of sale.", "en": " 當然，對我而言 我一定要完全相信我的肢體語言 那是我唯一的賣點"}, {"zh-tw": " It's silent gesture.

Back in 2000, I had the opportunity to go to South Africa to form a new opera company.", "en": " 現在就音樂經歷而言 我有一段既基本又真誠又重要的經驗 來自我在南非的冒險 我認為南非是世上最令人目眩神迷的音樂國家 但也就是這個國家，透過它的音樂文化 教了我一個根本的功課 就是透過音樂製作 能讓最基本 又激發生命力的信任關係進入更深的層次 回溯到西元2000年，一個機緣我到了南非 去組一個新的歌劇團"}, {"zh-tw": " So I went out there, and I auditioned, mainly in rural township locations, right around the country.

And in the last years of the old regime, he would routinely be detailed to go into the township to aggress the community.", "en": " 有個問題在第一次排練時浮上檯面 就是其中一位白人 他之前的身分 是南非警察的一分子 在種族隔離政策結束前幾年 他很可能是那個接受詳盡的指令 定期到鄉間攻擊黑人社群的一員"}, {"zh-tw": " Now you can imagine what this knowledge did to the temperature in the room, the general atmosphere. Let's be under no illusions.", "en": " 想像一下這樣的認知對排演場的影響 整體氣氛就怪怪的 讓我們面對現實吧"}, {"zh-tw": " In South Africa, the relationship most devoid of trust is that between a white policeman and the black community.

Simply through singing.", "en": " 在南非，最不能彼此信賴的兩種人 就是白人警察 與黑人族群 所以我們要如何彌補傷痕，各位？ 很簡單，就是唱歌"}, {"zh-tw": " We sang, we sang, we sang, and amazingly new trust grew, and indeed friendship blossomed.

We started touring them internationally.

It's called \"U-Carmen e-Khayelitsha\" -- literally \"Carmen of Khayelitsha.\" I want to play you a tiny clip of it now for no other reason than to give you proof positive that there is nothing tiny about South African music making.", "en": " 這部電影全以科薩語唱 科薩語非常具音樂性，如果你們不知道的話 這部電影名為「卡雅利莎的卡門」 意思就是「從卡雅利莎來的卡門」 現在讓我播一小段影片 不為別的，只為了證明 不能小看南非的音樂製作"}, {"zh-tw": " (Music) Something which I find utterly enchanting about South African music making is that it's so free. South Africans just make music really freely.", "en": " （音樂） 有一件關於南非的音樂製作的事 讓我非常著迷 就是，它非常自由 南非人作音樂就是很自由"}, {"zh-tw": " And I think, in no small way, that's due to one fundamental fact: they're not bound to a system of notation. They don't read music.", "en": " 而我認為，不是隨便想想而已 這是基於一個根本的事實 就是他們不被音樂標記法束縛 他們不看樂譜"}, {"zh-tw": " They trust their ears. You can teach a bunch of South Africans a tune in about five seconds flat.", "en": " 他們相信自己的音感 你可以用五秒鐘教一群南非人唱一段曲調"}, {"zh-tw": " And then, as if by magic, they will spontaneously improvise a load of harmony around that tune because they can.

And yet, ladies and gentlemen, every single one of us on this planet probably engages with music on a daily basis.", "en": " 所以這是保留給 菁英份子，有天分的人的 但是各位，在地球上的每一個人 每天都或多或少會跟音樂扯上關係"}, {"zh-tw": " And if I can broaden this out for a second, I'm willing to bet that every single one of you sitting in this room would be happy to speak with acuity, with total confidence, about movies, probably about literature. But how many of you would be able to make a confident assertion about a piece of classical music? Why is this? And what I'm going to say to you now is I'm just urging you to get over this supreme lack of self-confidence, to take the plunge, to believe that you can trust your ears, you can hear some of the fundamental muscle tissue, fiber, DNA, what makes a great piece of music great.", "en": " 容我放寬角度多說一些 我可以打賭，就是在座的每一位 都可以興高采烈地高談闊論 電影，甚或是文學 但是有多少人可以很有信心的評論 一首古典音樂呢？ 為什麼會這樣？ 我想要說的是 我鼓勵你們克服 這種超級沒自信的感覺 就讓我們大膽嘗試一下，相信你可以信任你的音感 聽到音樂的成分，就像看到基本的肌肉組織 纖維，DNA 那些偉大的音樂之所以偉大的地方"}, {"zh-tw": " I've got a little experiment I want to try with you. Did you know that TED is a tune? A very simple tune based on three notes -- T, E, D.", "en": " 我想跟你們做一段小小的實驗 你們可知 TED 是一段旋律？ 一段由T、E、D三個音組成，非常簡單的曲調"}, {"zh-tw": " Now hang on a minute. I know you're going to say to me, \"T doesn't exist in music.\" Well ladies and gentlemen, there's a time-honored system, which composers have been using for hundreds of years, which proves actually that it does.", "en": " 等一等 我知道你要說「沒有 T 這個音」 是的，各位來賓，有個歷史悠久的系統 作曲家已經用了好幾百年 可以證明「T」的確存在"}, {"zh-tw": " If I sing you a musical scale: A, B, C, D, E, F, G -- and I just carry on with the next set of letters in the alphabet, same scale: H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T -- there you go. T, see it's the same as F in music.", "en": " 如果你唱一段音階 A(La) B(Si) C(Do) D(Re) E(Mi) F(Fa) G(Sol) (唱名) 然後我把下一組的英文字母比照上述音階排列 H(La) I(Si) J(Do) K(Re) L(Mi) M(Fa) N(Sol) O(La) P(Si) Q(Do) R(Re) S(Mi) T(Fa)─你看 T 可以視為 F"}, {"zh-tw": " So T is F.

I think we should make this even more explicit.", "en": " （音樂） 喔我的天，真是響亮 我認為應該讓它更明顯一點"}, {"zh-tw": " Ladies and gentlemen, it's nearly time for tea. Would you reckon you need to sing for your tea, I think? I think we need to sing for our tea.", "en": " 各位，差不多是午茶時間了 你是不是覺得該唱首歌助興，對吧？ 我想我們是該唱首歌來配茶"}, {"zh-tw": " We're going to sing those three wonderful notes: T, E, D. Will you have a go for me?
