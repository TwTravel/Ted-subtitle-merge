Like them, many species of whalessaw their numbers drastically reduced by 200 years of whaling, where they were hunted and killedfor their whale meat, oil and whale bone.", "en": " 如今，牠們只剩數百隻，瀕臨滅絕。 同露脊鯨一樣，許多其他種類的鯨魚數量也急劇下降， 正是由於這兩百年來的捕鯨活動。 這期間鯨魚被獵殺，被獵取鯨魚肉、鯨魚油，和鯨魚骨。"}, {"zh-tw": " We only have whales in our waters today because of the Save the Whalesmovement of the '70s. It was instrumental in stoppingcommercial whaling, and was built on the idea thatif we couldn't save whales, what could we save? It was ultimately a testof our political ability to halt environmental destruction.", "en": " 今天我們的海域中之所以還有鯨魚， 是因為70年代的「拯救鯨魚」運動。 該運動有效阻止了商業捕鯨， 其基本理念是：如果我們連鯨魚都拯救不了， 我們還能拯救什么？ 這實質上考驗了我們的政治能力， 阻止環境破壞的政治能力。"}, {"zh-tw": " So in the early '80s, there wasa ban on commercial whaling that came into forceas a result of this campaign. Whales in our waters are stilllow in numbers, however, because they do face a rangeof other human-induced threats.", "en": " 這項運動的一個成果就是1980年代初 商業捕鯨禁令的頒布。 不過，我們的海域中鯨魚數量仍舊稀少， 因為鯨魚還面臨一系列其他的人類造成的威脅。"}, {"zh-tw": " Unfortunately, many people still thinkthat whale conservationists like myself do what we do only because these creaturesare charismatic and beautiful. This is actually a disservice, because whales are ecosystem engineers.", "en": " 很不幸，很多人仍覺得我這樣的鯨魚保護人士 是出於欣賞鯨魚的魅力和美麗而保護鯨魚。 這種思維其實會起反作用， 因為鯨魚是生態系統的工程師。"}, {"zh-tw": " They help maintain the stabilityand health of the oceans, and even provide servicesto human society. So let's talk about whysaving whales is critical to the resiliency of the oceans.", "en": " 牠們幫助維護海洋的穩定和健康， 甚至還能為人類社會做貢獻。 讓我們來談談為什麼拯救鯨魚 對保證海洋的自我調節很重要。"}, {"zh-tw": " It boils down to two main things: whale poop and rotting carcasses. As whales dive to the depths to feedand come up to the surface to breathe, they actually release theseenormous fecal plumes.", "en": " 歸根結底是兩個主要的東西： 鯨魚糞便和腐爛遺骸。 當鯨魚潛入深海捕食然後浮上海面呼吸時， 牠們排放出巨量的排泄流。"}, {"zh-tw": " This whale pump, as it's called, actually brings essential limiting nutrients from the depths to the surface waters where they stimulate the growth of phytoplankton, which forms the baseof all marine food chains. So really, having more whalesin the oceans pooping is really beneficialto the entire ecosystem.", "en": " 這種所謂的鯨魚泵 能將深海中的稀缺關鍵養分 帶到水表，促進浮游生物的生長， 而浮游生物是一切海洋食物鏈的基礎。 所以，讓更多的鯨魚在海洋中排泄 會對整個生態系統都有好處。"}, {"zh-tw": " Whales are also known to undertake some of the longest migrations of all mammals. Gray whales off Americamigrate 16,000 kilometers between productive feeding areas and lessproductive calving, or birthing, areas and back every year.", "en": " 鯨魚還是遷徙距離最遠的哺乳動物之一。 灰鯨每年遷徙1萬6千公里 來回在營養豐富的捕食水域和 營養欠缺的繁殖水域之間。"}, {"zh-tw": " As they do so, they transport fertilizerin the form of their feces from places that have itto places that need it. So clearly, whales are reallyimportant in nutrient cycling, both horizontally and vertically,through the oceans.", "en": " 在此過程中，牠們的糞便作為肥料 被從養分富饒的地方運送到養分稀缺的地方。 很顯然，鯨魚在海洋的營養循環中起重要作用， 無論是縱向還是橫向的營養循環。"}, {"zh-tw": " But what's really cool is that they're also really important after they're dead. Whale carcasses are some of the largest form of detritus to fall from the ocean's surface, and they're called whale fall.", "en": " 但非常有意思的是，牠們死後也起重要作用。 鯨魚遺骸是海平面下最大的腐質之一， 它們被稱作鯨魚下沉物。"}, {"zh-tw": " As these carcasses sink, they provide a feastto some 400-odd species, including the eel-shaped, slime-producing hagfish. So over the 200 years of whaling, when we were busy killing and removingthese carcasses from the oceans, we likely altered the rate and geographic distribution of these whale falls that would descend into deep oceans, and as a result, probably ledto a number of extinctions of species that were most specialized and dependent on these carcassesfor their survival.", "en": " 當遺骸下沉時， 它們給400個物種提供了盛宴， 其中包括鰻魚狀的、產生粘液的盲鰻。 所以，超過200年的捕鯨， 我們在匆忙殺戮，從海洋中移除這些遺骸的同時， 我們也很可能改變了這些鯨魚下沉物的 產生率和地理分布， 而這很可能導致了一些 專門食用和依靠這種遺骸生存的生物的滅絕。"}, {"zh-tw": " Whale carcasses are also knownto transport about 190,000 tons of carbon, which is the equivalent of that produced by 80,000 cars per year from the atmosphere to the deep oceans, and the deep oceansare what we call \"carbon sinks,\" because they trap and holdexcess carbon from the atmosphere, and therefore helpto delay global warming. Sometimes these carcassesalso wash up on beaches and provide a meal to a numberof predatory species on land.", "en": " 鯨魚的遺骸也能運輸約19萬噸的碳， 這相當於 8萬輛汽車 一年從大氣到海洋的碳排放。 深海被我們稱為「碳池」， 因為那裡能鎖住和存儲大氣中多餘的碳， 從而幫助減緩全球暖化。 有時這些遺骸還被沖刷上海岸， 為陸地上的一些捕獵生物提供食物。"}, {"zh-tw": " The 200 years of whalingwas clearly detrimental and caused a reductionin the populations of whales between 60 to 90 percent. Clearly, the Save the Whales movement was instrumental in preventingcommercial whaling from going on, but we need to revise this.", "en": " 這二百年的捕鯨行為破壞巨大， 它導致鯨魚數量減少了 60%到90%。 拯救鯨魚行動 在阻止商業捕鯨中確實起了關鍵作用， 但我們還需要做一些改進。"}, {"zh-tw": " We need to address the more modern,pressing problems that these whales face in our waters today. Amongst other things, we need to stop them from getting plowed down by container ships when they're in their feeding areas, and stop them from gettingentangled in fishing nets as they float around in the ocean.", "en": " 我們需要應對如今鯨魚所面臨的 更當代，更緊迫的問題。 其中，我們要防止鯨魚 在餵養水域中被運輸船撞死， 還要防止鯨魚在海洋上游蕩時 被漁網纏住。"}, {"zh-tw": " We also need to learn to contextualizeour conservation messages, so people really understand the true ecosystem value of these creatures. So, let's save the whales again, but this time, let's not just do it for their sake.", "en": " 我們還需學會將我們的動物保護資訊具體化， 以便人們能夠真正了解這些生物的實際生態價值。 讓我們再次拯救鯨魚， 然而這次，我們這樣做不僅是為鯨魚，"}, {"zh-tw": " Let's also do it for ours.
