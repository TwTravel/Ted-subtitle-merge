This is the aim of the third approach I want to talk about -- the Swedish or Nordicmodel of sex-work law. The idea behind this law is that selling sexis intrinsically harmful and so you're, in fact, helpingsex workers by removing the option.", "en": " 既然罪犯化處治性工作者會傷害他們， 那何不就只罪犯化嫖客？ 這就是接下來要講的 第三種法制， 瑞典和北歐的性工作法律模式。 這法律的理念是 賣淫在本質上是有害的， 所以借由除去市場需求，挽救性工作者。"}, {"zh-tw": " Despite growing support for what's often describedas the \"end demand\" approach, there's no evidence that it works.

It's because people selling sex often don't have other options for income. If you need that money, the only effect that a dropin business is going have is to force you to lower your prices or offer more risky sexual services.", "en": " 怎麼會這樣呢？ 這是因為賣淫者 通常沒有其它收入方式。 如果你需要錢， 而生意卻低落時， 你只能降價求售， 或提供高危險的性服務。"}, {"zh-tw": " If you need to find more clients, you might seek the help of a manager. So you see, rather than putting a stop to what's often descried as pimping, a law like this actually gives oxygen to potentially abusive third parties.", "en": " 如果需要更多客戶， 你會求經理人幫助。 所以你看，這並未制止所謂的拉皮條， 這樣的法律， 反而助長仲介濫用的機會。"}, {"zh-tw": " To keep safe in my work, I try not to take bookings from someone who calls me from a withheld number.

If you work outdoors, that means working aloneor in isolated locations, just as if you were criminalized yourself.", "en": " 而你又需要他的錢， 你就不會報警。 如果你在街上應召， 就得單獨或在偏暗地點， 就像在跑路一樣。"}, {"zh-tw": " It might mean getting into cars quicker, less negotiating timemeans snap decisions. Is this guy dangerous or just nervous? Can you afford to take the risk? Can you afford not to?

And in state-controlled prostitution, commercial sex can only happen in certain legally-designatedareas or venues, and sex workers are made to complywith special restrictions, like registrationand forced health checks.", "en": " 但它並不是很好的人權模範。 州政控管的賣淫制度， 性交易只能在 特定場所發生， 而且性工作者得遵守特殊規定， 像是註冊工作證和強制健康檢查。"}, {"zh-tw": " Regulation sounds great on paper, but politicians deliberately makeregulation around the sex industry expensive and difficult to comply with.

So.", "en": " 在這雙重體系下， 走投無路的人只能非法工作， 所以他們仍然暴露在我之前提過的 重重危險。 所以，"}, {"zh-tw": " It's looking like all attempts to control or prevent sex work from happening makes things more dangerousfor people selling sex. Fear of law enforcement makes themwork alone in isolated locations, and allows clients and even cops to get abusive in the knowledgethey'll get away with it.", "en": " 似乎所有企圖控制 或阻止性交易的辦法， 只使賣淫者的處境更加危險。 對執法的恐懼，使他們在偏僻的地方單獨工作， 嫖客甚至警察藉機虐待， 因為知道她們無從抵抗。"}, {"zh-tw": " Fines and criminal records forcepeople to keep selling sex, rather than enabling them to stop.

When France temporarily brought inthe Swedish model two years ago, ordinary citizens took it as a cue to start carrying out vigilante attacks against people working on the street.", "en": " 這些法律同時構成社會對性工作者的歧視及仇恨。 兩年前，法國試用瑞典模式期間， 一般市民就將它視為警訊， 民團開始襲擊 街上的妓女。"}, {"zh-tw": " In Sweden, opinion surveys show that significantly more people wantsex workers to be arrested now than before the law was brought in.

The solution is clearly to giveworkers more legal protections, allowing them to resist abuse and report it to authoritieswithout fear of arrest.", "en": " 在 2004 年，當 23 名中國偷渡客 在莫克姆灣採集海蚶時遇難， 也並沒因此取締整個海鮮行業 來拯救人口販賣受害者。 解決的辦法顯然是給勞工更多的法律保護， 讓他們不用擔心被拘捕， 能安心報案，抵制這些惡行。"}, {"zh-tw": " The way the term traffickingis thrown around implies that all undocumentedmigration into prostitution is forced. In fact, many migrantshave made a decision, out of economic need, to place themselves into the handsof people smugglers.", "en": " 「人口販賣」的字眼 常暗示所有賣淫的偷渡客都是被脅迫的。 但事實上，這是大多偷渡客所做的決定， 出於經濟需求， 將自己交入人口販子手上。"}, {"zh-tw": " Many do this with the full knowledge that they'll be selling sexwhen they reach their destination.
