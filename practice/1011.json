Instead, they just make me green with envy that my colleague from IUCN was able to go on this journey to the south of Madagascar seamounts to actually take photographs and to see these wondrous creatures of the deep.", "en": " 它在古代地圖上被標注 為‘怪物出沒’ 每一次到這裡新的探索 都帶回了許多驚奇特異生物的發現 它們曾被我們的祖先們認為是怪物 然而，它們卻讓我充滿羡慕嫉妒 因為我的IUCN(國際自然保護聯盟)的同事 能夠到馬達加斯加海嶺南部進行這次探索旅行 拍到真實的照片 並且親眼看到這些驚奇的深海生物"}, {"zh-tw": " We are talking about the high seas. The \"high seas\" is a legal term, but in fact, it covers 50 percent of the planet.", "en": " 我們談論的是公海 公海是一個法律概念 但實際上，公海的範圍覆蓋了整個地球的一半"}, {"zh-tw": " With an average depth of the oceans of 4,000 meters, in fact, the high seas covers and provides nearly 90 percent of the habitat for life on this Earth. It is, in theory, the global commons, belonging to us all.", "en": " 公海平均深度 為四千米 事實上，公海提供了 幾乎百分之九十的生存場所 為地球上的生命 理論上說，它是全球所共有的 屬於我們大家"}, {"zh-tw": " But in reality, it is managed by and for those who have the resources to go out and exploit it. So today I'm going to take you on a voyage to cast light on some of the outdated myths and legends and assumptions that have kept us as the true stakeholders in the high seas in the dark.", "en": " 但是實際上 它的管理者是 那些能夠有條件 去公海航行和探索的人們 所以今天我會帶大家進行一次航行 去消除一些陳舊的謎團 傳說和假設 這些一直阻礙我們成為真正的利益相關者 在昏暗的公海海洋中"}, {"zh-tw": " We're going to voyage to some of these special places that we've been discovering in the past few years to show why we really need to care. And then finally, we're going to try to develop and pioneer a new perspective on high seas governance that's rooted in ocean-basin-wide conservation, but framed in an arena of global norms of precaution and respect.", "en": " 我們將要去的是一些十分特別的地方 這些地方我們已經在過去幾年有了很多探索和發現 我要向大家展示我們應該真正關心公海的原因 而且最終我們將會嘗試 去發展和開創出一個嶄新的觀念 對於公海管理 根植于海盆的保護 但是卻有著國際準則的框架 的預防和重視"}, {"zh-tw": " So here is a picture of the high seas as seen from above -- that area in the darker blue. To me, as an international lawyer, this scared me far more than any of the creatures or the monsters we may have seen, for it belies the notion that you can actually protect the ocean, the global ocean, that provides us all with carbon storage, with heat storage, with oxygen, if you can only protect 36 percent.", "en": " 這是一張公海的圖片 正如我們之前所看到 這些範圍用深藍色表示 我作為一個國際法工作者 這讓我感到害怕 比任何我們可能見過的生物或怪物更為害怕 因為這證明了我們沒有真正地保護海洋 全球海域 它提供給我們所有的碳 熱，還有氧 如果你只保護了其中的百分之三十六"}, {"zh-tw": " This is indeed the true heart of the planet. Some of the problems that we have to confront are that the current international laws -- for example, shipping -- provide more protection to the areas closest to shore.", "en": " 這是這個星球的真正的心臟 我們不得不面對的一些問題是 現在的國際法 例如，航行條例 提供了保護更多的是 對那些靠近海岸的海域"}, {"zh-tw": " For example, garbage discharge, something you would think just simply goes away, but the laws regulating ship discharge of garbage actually get weaker the further you are from shore. As a result, we have garbage patches the size of twice-Texas.", "en": " 例如，垃圾排放 有些你考慮到的僅僅是略過 但是監管 航船垃圾排放的法律 當你越遠離海岸實際上越鬆散 結果，我們排放的垃圾面積 有兩個德克薩斯大"}, {"zh-tw": " It's unbelievable. We used to think the solution to pollution was dilution, but that has proved to be no longer the case.", "en": " 真是難以置信 我們曾經想過解決污染的辦法 那就是稀釋 但是那已被證實無法繼續奏效"}, {"zh-tw": " So what we have learned from social scientists and economists like Elinor Ostrom, who are studying the phenomenon of management of the commons on a local scale, is that there are certain prerequisites that you can put into place that enable you to manage and access open space for the good of one and all. And these include a sense of shared responsibility, common norms that bind people together as a community.", "en": " 所以我們從一些社會學家 和像Elinor Ostrom這樣的經濟學家 他們研究的現象 是局部地區公共財產的管理 學習到的是有一些特定前提條件 你需要置定 這些條件讓你能夠管理 和接觸公共領域 為了個人和社會的利益 這些包括一種共同的責任感 讓人們組成社會的共同規範"}, {"zh-tw": " Conditional access: You can invite people in, but they have to be able to play by the rules.

For a group of very dedicated individuals -- scientists, conservationists, photographers and states -- were able to actually change a tragic trajectory that was destroying fragile seascapes such as this coral garden that you see in front of you.", "en": " 我想要傳達的是 劫難和陰暗 並不是我們在公海上所看到的全部 對於那些十分具有奉獻精神的人們 科學家，生態環境保護者 攝影師和國家等 有能力去阻止一個悲劇的發生 摧毀那些脆弱的海洋風光 正如這個珊瑚群 你們所看到的這個"}, {"zh-tw": " That is, we're able to save it from a fate of deep-sea bottom trawling. And how did we do that? Well, as I said, we had a group of photographers that went out on board ships and actually photographed the activities in process.", "en": " 我們有能力拯救它 免受深海海底拖網作業的破壞 我們是如何做到的呢 正如我所說，我們有一群攝影師，他們登上開往公海的船 拍攝這些拖網作業活動的照片"}, {"zh-tw": " But we also spent many hours in the basements of the United Nations, trying to work with governments to make them understand what was going on so far away from land that few of us had ever even imagined that these creatures existed. So within three years, from 2003 to 2006, we were able to get norm in place that actually changed the paradigm of how fishers went about deep-sea bottom trawling.", "en": " 另外我們也投入大量時間 在聯合國的機構 努力與各國政府合作并讓他們瞭解到 遠離陸地的深海上鎖發生的這一切 這些我們從未能想像得到 這些生物的存在 在這三年中 二〇〇三年到二〇〇六年 我們能夠建立規範 這些規範改變了過去的範式 關於捕魚業者去 深海海底的拖網作業"}, {"zh-tw": " Instead of \"go anywhere, do anything you want,\" we actually created a regime that required prior assessment of where you're going and a duty to prevent significant harm.

But what it does mean is that a group of individuals can form a community to actually shape the way high seas are governed, to create a new regime.", "en": " 這並不意味著這就是公海問題的最終解決方案 也不意味著這為公海提供了永久的保護 但是這意味著 一群個體能夠組成一個社會 去塑造 公海時代的管理方法 去創造新的規範制度"}, {"zh-tw": " So I'm looking optimistically at our opportunities for creating a true, blue perspective for this beautiful planet. Sylvia's wish provides us with that leverage, that access to the heart of human beings, you might say, who have rarely seen places beyond their own toes, but are now hopefully going to become interested in the full life-cycle of creatures like these sea turtles, who indeed spend most of their time in the high seas.", "en": " 所以我十分看好我們的機遇 創造一個真正的蔚藍樣貌 為這個美麗的星球 西爾維婭的希望(項目名稱) 為我們提供了捷徑 到人類的內心 也許你會說 這些人幾乎沒看過自己腳尖外一點的地方 現在卻好像越來越感興趣 像海龜這樣的生物的生命週期 這些人在公海方面投入了大量的時間和精力"}, {"zh-tw": " Today, we're just going to voyage to a small sampling of some of these special areas, just to give you an idea of the flavor of the riches and wonders they do contain. The Sargasso Sea, for example, is not a sea bounded by coastlines, but it is bounded by oceanic currents that contain and envelope this wealth of sargassum that grows and aggregates there.", "en": " 今天我們只是航行到一個很小的海域 它只是這些特別海域的一個樣本 只是爲了讓大家能有一些 對於公海內涵的豐富和奇妙的一些初步認識 例如，馬尾藻海域 這不是一個被海岸線包圍的海域 而是被洋流所環繞 這些洋流帶來了 海藻所需要的養分 這些養分讓這裡的海藻十分旺盛地繁衍和聚集"}, {"zh-tw": " It's also known as the spawning ground for eels from Northern European and Northern American rivers that are now so dwindling in numbers that they've actually stopped showing up in Stockholm, and five showed up in the U.K. just recently. But the Sargasso Sea, the same way it aggregates sargassum weed, actually is pulling in the plastic from throughout the region.", "en": " 這個海域也作為鰻魚的產卵地而著名 這些鰻魚來自北歐 和北美的河流 他們的數量正在大量減少 因為它們在斯德哥爾摩便停止了活動 而且才在英國有了一些活動的跡象 但是馬尾藻海域 正如它不斷集聚了馬尾藻的種子 也正在不斷集聚塑料垃圾 這些垃圾來自北大西洋地區"}, {"zh-tw": " This picture doesn't exactly show the plastics that I would like it to show, because I haven't been out there myself. But there has just been a study that was released in February that showed there are 200,000 pieces of plastic per square-kilometer now floating in the surface of the Sargasso Sea, and that is affecting the habitat for the many species in their juvenile stages who come to the Sargasso Sea for its protection and its food.", "en": " 這張圖片並沒有準確的展示 我想要展示的那些塑料垃圾，因為我自己從未到過那裡 但是有最新的研究 已經在二月份在那裡進行 這個研究表明那裡每平方公里有二十萬個 塑料垃圾 現在它們正漂浮在馬尾藻海域的表面 研究還表明它們正嚴重影響著 許多物種幼蟲階段的生存發育環境 這些生物來到馬尾藻海域 正是爲了得到這片海域的保護和養分"}, {"zh-tw": " The Sargasso Sea is also a wondrous place for the aggregation of these unique species that have developed to mimic the sargassum habitat. It also provides a special habitat for these flying fish to lay their eggs.", "en": " 馬尾藻海域也是一個令人驚奇的地方 因為這裡集聚了大量奇特的生物 它們已經適應了馬尾藻海的生存環境 它也提供了一個特殊的場所 為這些飛魚產卵"}, {"zh-tw": " But what I'd like to get from this picture is that we truly do have an opportunity to launch a global initiative for protection. Thus, the government of Bermuda has recognized the need and its responsibility as having some of the Sargasso Sea within its national jurisdiction -- but the vast majority is beyond -- to help spearhead a movement to achieve protection for this vital area.", "en": " 但是我從這張圖片中所感受到的是 我們真的擁有一個機會 去開創一種全球化的保護 百慕大政府已經發現了這樣的必要性 和自己的責任 因為它在部份馬尾藻海域 擁有司法管轄權力 但是在廣袤的其他海域卻沒有 百慕大政府正帶頭發起一次行動 來保護這個極其重要的海域"}, {"zh-tw": " Spinning down to someplace a little bit cooler than here right now: the Ross Sea in the Southern Ocean. It's actually a bay.", "en": " 現在讓我們轉到一個比馬尾藻海域冷一點的地方 南太平洋的羅斯海域 實際上這是一個海灣"}, {"zh-tw": " It's considered high seas, because the continent has been put off limits to territorial claims. So anything in the water is treated as if it's the high seas.", "en": " 它被視為公海，因為這裡 在任何國家的管轄範圍之外 沒有任何主權領土宣稱 所以這裡水下的一切都與公海內的同樣對待"}, {"zh-tw": " But what makes the Ross Sea important is the vast sea of pack ice that in the spring and summer provides a wealth of phytoplankton and krill that supports what, till recently, has been a virtually intact near-shore ecosystem. But unfortunately, CCAMLR, the regional commission in charge of conserving and managing fish stocks and other living marine resources, is unfortunately starting to give in to fishing interests and has authorized the expansion of toothfish fisheries in the region.", "en": " 但是讓羅斯海域十分重要的是 這裡大量的海冰 在春夏季節 這些海冰為浮游植物和磷蝦提供了養分 直到今天，這些生物仍支持著 這個事實上原封未動未受損害的 近海生態系統 但是不幸的是，CAMLAR 它是一個地域性的委員會 負責保護和管理漁業資源 和其他一些海洋資源 十分不幸的是它目前開始在漁業利益上讓步 并授權 增加這個海域的圓鱈魚捕撈量"}, {"zh-tw": " The captain of a New Zealand vessel who was just down there is reporting a significant decline in the number of the Ross Sea killer whales, who are directly dependent on the Antarctic toothfish as their main source of food. So what we need to do is to stand up boldly, singly and together, to push governments, to push regional fisheries management organizations, to declare our right to declare certain areas off-limits to high seas fishing, so that the freedom to fish no longer means the freedom to fish anywhere and anytime.", "en": " 一個新西蘭船長 他才去過羅斯海 報告了那裡 虎鯨數量的急劇減少 這些虎鯨十分依賴南極地區的圓鱈魚 作為他們的主要食物 所以我們要做的是勇敢的站起來 我們一起 向政府施壓 向那些地區漁業管理機構施壓 表明我們的權利 表明一些公海漁業捕撈量的合理上限 來阻止捕撈自由成為一種 何時何地都能捕撈的無限自由"}, {"zh-tw": " Coming closer to here, the Costa Rica Dome is a recently discovered area -- potentially year-round habitat for blue whales. There's enough food there to last them the summer and the winter long.", "en": " 換一個比較靠近我們的海域，中部美洲西海岸 是一個最近才開發的地區 潛在的藍鯨的週期性生存海域 這裡有足夠食物 支持它們度過四季"}, {"zh-tw": " But what's unusual about the Costa Rica Dome is, in fact, it's not a permanent place. It's an oceanographic phenomenon that shifts in time and space on a seasonal basis.", "en": " 但是這片海域特殊之處在于 實際上它不是一個永久固定的地方 這是一種海洋學現象 會隨著時間和地域季節性變動"}, {"zh-tw": " So, in fact, it's not permanently in the high seas. It's not permanently in the exclusive economic zones of these five Central American countries, but it moves with the season.", "en": " 所以事實上，它并非是在公海上永久固定 它也沒有固定在中美五國的 專屬經濟區內 它隨著季節不斷移動"}, {"zh-tw": " As such, it does create a challenge to protect, but we also have a challenge protecting the species that move along with it. We can use the same technologies that fishers use to identify where the species are, in order to close the area when it's most vulnerable, which may, in some cases, be year-round.", "en": " 正因如此，這向我們的保護提出了挑戰 也向我們保護隨著它一起移動的生物提出了挑戰 我們可以用捕魚者使用的技術 來確認這些生物在哪裡 爲了靠近這個海域 當它十分脆弱時 有時是以年為週期"}, {"zh-tw": " Getting closer to shore, where we are, this was in fact taken in the Galapagos. Many species are headed through this region, which is why there's been so much attention put into conservation of the Eastern Tropical Pacific Seascape.", "en": " 當我們靠近海岸一點 便會發現這正是加拉帕戈斯群島所發生的 許多物種都從這個區域通過 這正是這裡 在保護工作方面被重視的原因 這個地區在東太平洋的熱帶部份"}, {"zh-tw": " This is the initiative that's been coordinated by Conservation International with a variety of partners and governments to actually try to bring integrated management regime throughout the area. That is, it provides a wonderful example of where you can go with a real regional initiative.", "en": " 這是第一次保護工作的配合 國際保護組織 和許多合作夥伴和政府 一起嘗試建立共同管理規範 在這一片區域 這次合作提供了一個十分好的關於能在哪裡活動的示範 在一個真正的地區主動管理下"}, {"zh-tw": " It's protecting five World Heritage sites. Unfortunately, the World Heritage Convention does not recognize the need to protect areas beyond national jurisdiction, at present.", "en": " 它正保護著五個世界遺產 不幸的是，世界遺產協會 尚未認識到保護這片區域的重要性 而且這個地區當前並沒有在某國的管轄範圍內"}, {"zh-tw": " So a place like the Costa Rica Dome could not technically qualify the time it's in the high seas. So what we've been suggesting is that we either need to amend the World Heritage Convention, so that it can adopt and urge universal protection of these World Heritage sites, or we need to change the name and call it Half-the-World Heritage Convention.", "en": " 所以一個像中美西海岸這樣的地區 嚴格來說無法說明 公海的全部情況 所以我們建議 要么我們需要對世界遺產協會進行一些修正 以讓它適應 和推動這些世界遺產的普遍保護 要么我們需要給它改名 稱呼它為一半世界遺產協會"}, {"zh-tw": " But what we also know is that species like these sea turtles do not stay put in the Eastern Tropical Pacific Seascape. These happen to go down to a vast South Pacific Gyre, where they spend most of their time and often end up getting hooked like this, or as bycatch.", "en": " 同時我們也知道像海龜這樣的物種 並非一直待在東太平洋的熱帶海域 它們有時會南下到廣闊的南太平洋涡流 在那裡度過它們大部份的時光 而且它們常常最後被像這樣被鉤著 或者被漁業混獲"}, {"zh-tw": " So what I'd really like to suggest is that we need to scale-up. We need to work locally, but we also need to work ocean-basin-wide.", "en": " 所以我非常建議的是我們需要擴展 我們需要在當地協作 同時我們也需要在海盆上開展保護工作"}, {"zh-tw": " We have the tools and technologies now to enable us to take a broader ocean-basin-wide initiative. We've heard about the Tagging of Pacific Predators project, one of the 17 Census of Marine Life projects.", "en": " 我們現在擁有科技和技術 能夠讓我們在更廣闊的 海盆上開創保護工作 我們已經聽聞了關於給太平洋肉食動物標記的項目 這個項目是十七個海洋生物普查工作之一"}, {"zh-tw": " It's provided us data like this, of tiny, little sooty shearwaters that make the entire ocean basin their home. They fly 65,000 kilometers in less than a year.", "en": " 它為我們提供了像 烏黑的小海鷗等海洋生物的數據 整個海盆都是這些小海鷗的家 它們飛行六萬五千公里 在一年之內"}, {"zh-tw": " So we have the tools and treasures coming from the Census of Marine Life. And its culminating year that's going to be launched in October.", "en": " 所以我們有著來自海洋生物普查項目的測量技術和數據 而且這個項目的結束 會在十月份"}, {"zh-tw": " So stay tuned for further information. What I find so exciting is that the Census of Marine Life has looked at more than the tagging of pacific predators; it's also looked in the really unexplored mid-water column, where creatures like this flying sea cucumber have been found.", "en": " 所以當前爲了更多的數據信息它正在調整 我認為這個項目令人興奮的是 海洋生物的普查 並不只限於海洋肉食動物的標記工作 它也關注了尚未被探索的海水中層生物 那裡有像這樣遊動的海參 它們已經被發現"}, {"zh-tw": " And fortunately, we've been able, as IUCN, to team up with the Census of Marine Life and many of the scientists working there to actually try to translate much of this information to policymakers. We have the support of governments now behind us.", "en": " 更幸運的是，因為IUCN的努力，我們已經有能力與 海洋生物普查項目 和許多在這個項目中工作的科學家們一起合作 嘗試去為政策制定者解讀 這些數據中的大量信息 我們現在擁有了政府機構的支持"}, {"zh-tw": " We've been revealing this information through technical workshops. And the exciting thing is that we do have sufficient information to move ahead to protect some of these significant hope spots, hotspots.", "en": " 我們一直通過科技小組進行著這些信息的解讀工作 一個令人振奮的是我們的確擁有了足夠的信息 來更進一步保護這些 十分富有希望的地區，熱點地區"}, {"zh-tw": " At the same time we're saying, \"Yes, we need more. We need to move forward.\" But many of you have said, if you get these marine protected areas, or a reasonable regime for high seas fisheries management in place, how are you going to enforce it? Which leads me to my second passion besides ocean science, which is outer space technology. I wanted to be an astronaut, so I've constantly followed what are the tools available to monitor Earth from outer space -- and that we have incredible tools like we've been learning about, in terms of being able to follow tagged species throughout their life-cycles in the open ocean.", "en": " 同時我們也在號召 對，我們需要更多，我們需要前進 然而我們中的一部份人問過 如果你們讓這些海域得到了保護 或者為公海漁業管理創造了合理的規範 你如何去執行它呢 這個問題引起了我對於海洋科學聆之外領域的濃烈興趣 這邊是太空科技 我曾經想成為一個宇航員 所以我一直關注著 有些什麽樣的技術能夠對地球進行檢測 從外太空 我也看到了我們擁有一些難以置信的技術，正如我們已經知道的 跟蹤那些被標注的生物的科技 在他們整個的生命週期 在遼闊的海洋"}, {"zh-tw": " We can also tag and track fishing vessels. Many already have transponders on board that allow us to find out where they are and even what they're doing.", "en": " 我們同樣也能標記和追蹤捕魚船 許多捕魚船已經在船上裝備了轉發器 能夠讓我們知道他們在哪裡並且能知道他們在幹什麼"}, {"zh-tw": " But not all the vessels have those to date. It does not take too much rocket science to actually try to create new laws to mandate, if you're going to have the privilege of accessing our high seas resources, we need to know -- someone needs to know -- where you are and what you're doing.", "en": " 可是並非所有的船隻都裝備了這個 我們並不需要很多高科技 來制定和執行新的法律 如果你將擁有特權 能夠獲得我們公海上的資源 我們需要知道--有人需要知道-- 你在哪裡和你在做什麽"}, {"zh-tw": " So it brings me to my main take-home message, which is we can avert a tragedy of the commons. We can stop the collision course of 50 percent of the planet with the high seas.", "en": " 所以又回到了我的主題 就是我們能避免公用資源的悲劇 我們能夠阻止那些衝突 這些衝突發生在占這個星球一半的 公海上"}, {"zh-tw": " But we need to think broad-scale. We need to think globally. We need to change how we actually go about managing these resources.", "en": " 然而我們需要從一個廣闊的角度來思考 我們需要全球化的思考 我們需要改變我們現在的做法 管理這些資源"}, {"zh-tw": " We need to get the new paradigm of precaution and respect. At the same time, we need to think locally, which is the joy and marvel of Sylvia's hope spot wish, is that we can shine a spotlight on many of these previously unknown areas, and to bring people to the table, if you will, to actually make them feel part of this community that truly has a stake in their future management.", "en": " 我們需要制定新的規範 來預防和重視 同時，我們也需要當地化的思考 這正是西爾維婭的希望取得成果的原因 我們能夠突出一個熱點 在這些之前并不為人所知的地區 然後把人們帶到問題面前--如果你願意-- 來讓他們感到他們是我們這個社會的一部份 這個社會擁有一個 對於他們未來的管理十分重大的利益"}, {"zh-tw": " And third is that we need to look at ocean-basin-wide management. Our species are ocean-basin-wide.", "en": " 我想說的第三點是我們需要關注整個海盆的管理 許多生物都是在海盆活動"}, {"zh-tw": " Many of the deep-sea communities have genetic distribution that goes ocean-basin-wide. We need to better understand, but we also need to start to manage and protect.", "en": " 許多深海生態系統 有著基因配置 在整個海盆的範圍內的配置 我們需要懂得 我們也需要開始管理和保護"}, {"zh-tw": " And in order to do that, you also need ocean-basin management regimes. That is, we have regional management regimes within the exclusive economic zone, but we need to scale these up, we need to build their capacity, so they're like the Southern Ocean, where they do have the two-pronged fisheries and conservation organization.", "en": " 另外爲了做好這一點 我們也需要一些海盆管理的規範 正如我們有著區域性的管理規範 在專屬經濟區內 但我們也需要將他們整合，我們需要創建這些規範的權限 例如南太平洋 那片海域有自相衝突的漁業 和保護組織"}, {"zh-tw": " So with that, I would just like to sincerely thank and honor Sylvia Earle for her wish, for it is helping us to put a face on the high seas and the deep seas beyond national jurisdiction. It's helping to bring an incredible group of talented people together to really try to solve and penetrate these problems that have created our obstacles to management and rational use of this area that was once so far away and remote.", "en": " 所以在這一點上，我真誠地感謝和讚揚 Sylvia Earle的希望 因為它幫助我們重視公海 和沒有被國家主權覆蓋的遠洋 它幫助我們組建了一個令人不可思議的團隊 這個團隊有各種富有才華的人 一起真正的去解決和發現 這些成為了 我們管理和合理使用 這片曾經如此遙遠的公海海域的問題"}, {"zh-tw": " So on this tour, I hope I provided you with a new perspective of the high seas: one, that it is our home too, and that we need to work together if we are to make this a sustainable ocean future for us all. Thank you.", "en": " 所以通過這樣的一次旅行，我希望我已經為大家展示了 一種關於公海的新的視角 公海同樣是我們的家園 我們需要一起努力 如果我們想讓公海在未來成為一片可持續發展的共有海洋 謝謝大家"}], "title": "Kristina Gjerde Making Law On The High Seas"}
