Well, the topic I'm going to discuss is one which is, in a certain sense, very peculiar because it's very old.", "en": " 謝謝 請原諒我坐著說話，我老了 嗯，我今天要談論的主題 是一個在某種程度上非常特殊的主題 因為它非常古老"}, {"zh-tw": " Roughness is part of human life forever and forever, and ancient authors have written about it. It was very much uncontrollable, and in a certain sense, it seemed to be the extreme of complexity, just a mess, a mess and a mess.", "en": " 粗糙度，自古以來 就是人類生命的一部份 古老的作家曾寫過它 它是非常難以掌握的概念 而且，在某種意義上說來， 它看起來極度複雜， 亂無章法，"}, {"zh-tw": " There are many different kinds of mess. Now, in fact, by a complete fluke, I got involved many years ago in a study of this form of complexity, and to my utter amazement, I found traces -- very strong traces, I must say -- of order in that roughness.", "en": " 有著許多不同種類的混亂。 現在，事實上 我幸運地 在許多年前參與了一項 關於這種複雜圖形的研究 我驚異地發現 一些蛛絲馬跡—— 我必須說——有非常顯著的蛛絲馬跡顯示， 粗糙度具有次序"}, {"zh-tw": " And so today, I would like to present to you a few examples of what this represents. I prefer the word roughness to the word irregularity because irregularity -- to someone who had Latin in my long-past youth -- means the contrary of regularity.", "en": " 因此今天，我要向各位呈現 一些關於這項研究 的例子。 比起不規則度（irregularity） 我更喜歡用粗糙度（roughness）這個詞 因為，不規則度（irregularity） 對學過拉丁文的人來說 （也就是在我遙遠的青少年時） 是規律（regularity）的反義詞，"}, {"zh-tw": " But it is not so. Regularity is the contrary of roughness because the basic aspect of the world is very rough.", "en": " 然而，在真實世界裏， 粗糙度才是規律的反義詞。 因為世界的基本外觀 是極度粗糙、崎嶇的。"}, {"zh-tw": " So let me show you a few objects. Some of them are artificial.", "en": " 我給各位看看一些物體 有些是人工的"}, {"zh-tw": " Others of them are very real, in a certain sense. Now this is the real. It's a cauliflower.", "en": " 有些，在某種程度上，是非常真實的 而現在這一個是真的。這是一朵花椰菜"}, {"zh-tw": " Now why do I show a cauliflower, a very ordinary and ancient vegetable? Because old and ancient as it may be, it's very complicated and it's very simple, both at the same time. If you try to weigh it -- of course it's very easy to weigh it, and when you eat it, the weight matters -- but suppose you try to measure its surface.", "en": " 爲什麽我要展示花椰菜？ 爲什麽要展示這麼一個普通、古老的蔬菜呢？ 因為古老的事物，恰如其分地， 非常複雜、 同時也非常簡單。 如果你試著掂掂它的重量，當然，我們很容易可以量出來 當你要吃它時，重量是個問題 但是，假如你試著 測量它的表面"}, {"zh-tw": " Well, it's very interesting. If you cut, with a sharp knife, one of the florets of a cauliflower and look at it separately, you think of a whole cauliflower, but smaller.", "en": " 這就非常有意思了 如果你用一把鋒利的刀子 切下花椰菜中一個小花 分開來看它， 你會想，這是一整個花椰菜，只是小了些，"}, {"zh-tw": " And then you cut again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, and you still get small cauliflowers. So the experience of humanity has always been that there are some shapes which have this peculiar property, that each part is like the whole, but smaller.", "en": " 接著，你再切一刀， 一而再，再而三地反復切它， 最後，你仍會得到一朵朵小花椰菜。 所以人類的經驗 總是存在著一些 擁有特殊屬性的形狀， 每個部分就如同它的整體， 只是稍微小了一些。"}, {"zh-tw": " Now, what did humanity do with that? Very, very little. So what I did actually is to study this problem, and I found something quite surprising.", "en": " 那麼此刻，人類對它做了些什麽研究？ 非常、非常少 所以實際上我所做的是 研究這個問題 找出某些令人詫異的東西"}, {"zh-tw": " That one can measure roughness by a number, a number, 2.3, 1.2 and sometimes much more. One day, a friend of mine, to bug me, brought a picture and said, \"What is the roughness of this curve?\" I said, \"Well, just short of 1.5.\" It was 1.48.", "en": " 找出可以衡量粗糙度的東西 透過數字，一個數目 2.3、1.2，有時更多。 有一天，我的朋友 試著激怒我， 他帶一張照片給我，說： 「這個曲線的粗糙度為何？」 我回答：「嗯，不到1.5」 那粗糙度只有 1.48"}, {"zh-tw": " Now, it didn't take me any time. I've been looking at these things for so long.", "en": " 不須花多少時間 這些東西我已經已經看了許久，"}, {"zh-tw": " So these numbers are the numbers which denote the roughness of these surfaces. I hasten to say that these surfaces are completely artificial.", "en": " 這些數目是 用來表示表面的粗糙度 我必須事先聲明，這些表面外觀是 完全人工的"}, {"zh-tw": " They were done on a computer, and the only input is a number, and that number is roughness. So on the left, I took the roughness copied from many landscapes.", "en": " 它們由電腦做成 唯一要輸入，就是一個數字 那數字就是粗糙度 在那左邊 我複製許多景觀的表面粗糙度"}, {"zh-tw": " To the right, I took a higher roughness. So the eye, after a while, can distinguish these two very well.", "en": " 在右邊，我取較高的粗糙度 所以，眼睛過了一會 便可以容易地區分兩者了"}, {"zh-tw": " Humanity had to learn about measuring roughness. This is very rough, and this is sort of smooth, and this perfectly smooth.", "en": " 人類必須學習如何衡量粗糙度 這非常粗糙、這有點平滑、而這又極度平滑"}, {"zh-tw": " Very few things are very smooth. So then if you try to ask questions: \"What's the surface of a cauliflower?\" Well, you measure and measure and measure.", "en": " 很少有東西是極度平滑的 因此，假使你試著提出一個問題： 花椰菜的表面積有多少？ 嗯，你會一量再量"}, {"zh-tw": " Each time you're closer, it gets bigger, down to very, very small distances. What's the length of the coastline of these lakes? The closer you measure, the longer it is.", "en": " 每一次你靠近它，它就變得更大 可無限遞迴到很小的距離 這些湖的沿岸 有多長？ 當你越是測量它，它就越長"}, {"zh-tw": " The concept of length of coastline, which seems to be so natural because it's given in many cases, is, in fact, complete fallacy; there's no such thing. You must do it differently.", "en": " 沿岸線的概念 看起來是如此自然 因為，它在許多情況下被給定了 但事實上，這完全謬誤。根本沒有這回事。 你必須採取不同的做法"}, {"zh-tw": " What good is that, to know these things? Well, surprisingly enough, it's good in many ways. To begin with, artificial landscapes, which I invented sort of, are used in cinema all the time.", "en": " 要理解這些，該採取什麽樣的辦法呢？ 令人驚訝的是， 我們可以透過各種途徑 首先，我發明的 這些人造景觀 都是用在電影上"}, {"zh-tw": " We see mountains in the distance. They may be mountains, but they may be just formulae, just cranked on.", "en": " 我們看到遠處的山 也許真的是山，但也有可能是公式計算來的，"}, {"zh-tw": " Now it's very easy to do. It used to be very time-consuming, but now it's nothing.", "en": " 現在要做這個是很容易了 以往，製作這些必須曠日費時，但現在根本沒什麼"}, {"zh-tw": " Now look at that. That's a real lung. Now a lung is something very strange.", "en": " 現在，看那，那是一個真正的肺臟 肺是一種非常古怪的東西"}, {"zh-tw": " If you take this thing, you know very well it weighs very little. The volume of a lung is very small, but what about the area of the lung? Anatomists were arguing very much about that.", "en": " 如果你測量它 你知道它的重量極小 肺的體積很小 但肺的面積又如何呢？ 針對這個問題，以前解剖學家常有激烈的爭論"}, {"zh-tw": " Some say that a normal male's lung has an area of the inside of a basketball [court]. And the others say, no, five basketball [courts].", "en": " 有些人說，普通男子的肺 面積有 一個籃球場大 另外有些人認為，不，它有五個籃球場大"}, {"zh-tw": " Enormous disagreements. Why so? Because, in fact, the area of the lung is something very ill-defined.", "en": " 大家所持的意見相當不同 爲什麽呢？因為事實上，肺的面積 從沒有明確的定義。"}, {"zh-tw": " The bronchi branch, branch, branch and they stop branching, not because of any matter of principle, but because of physical considerations: the mucus, which is in the lung. So what happens is that in a way you have a much bigger lung, but it branches and branches down to distances about the same for a whale, for a man and for a little rodent.", "en": " 支氣管不斷分出分支 而在其末梢停止了分支 並不是和什麽原則有關 而是由於肺臟裡頭的物理因素 因為肺裏的粘液所致。 在某種情況之下 你會有較大的肺。 但假使它不斷地分支出來， 在很微觀的情形下， 鯨魚、人和齧齒目動物會有相等面積的肺。"}, {"zh-tw": " Now, what good is it to have that? Well, surprisingly enough, amazingly enough, the anatomists had a very poor idea of the structure of the lung until very recently. And I think that my mathematics, surprisingly enough, has been of great help to the surgeons studying lung illnesses and also kidney illnesses, all these branching systems, for which there was no geometry.", "en": " 這有什麼好處嗎？ 嗯，令人訝異地 直到近日以來，解剖學家都不太理解 肺臟的構造， 我想我的數學 令人驚訝地 可以帶來許多幫助 給外科醫生 幫助他們研究肺臟 和腎臟 這些分叉管的系統的疾病 因爲在這些系統中沒有幾何學。"}, {"zh-tw": " So I found myself, in other words, constructing a geometry, a geometry of things which had no geometry. And a surprising aspect of it is that very often, the rules of this geometry are extremely short.", "en": " 所以，換句話說，我發現我自己， 正在建立一種幾何學 一種沒有幾何圖形的東西的的幾何學 而且，令人訝異的是 這個幾何學的規則 經常是極短的，"}, {"zh-tw": " You have formulas that long. And you crank it several times.", "en": " 你有這麼長的公式， 曲折了好幾次"}, {"zh-tw": " Sometimes repeatedly: again, again, again, the same repetition. And at the end, you get things like that.", "en": " 有時候就只是一味地重復 再重複，循著同樣方式反複循環 最後，你會得到像這樣的東西"}, {"zh-tw": " This cloud is completely, 100 percent artificial. Well, 99.9.", "en": " 這片雲是100% 完全人工的 嗯，99.9。"}, {"zh-tw": " And the only part which is natural is a number, the roughness of the cloud, which is taken from nature. Something so complicated like a cloud, so unstable, so varying, should have a simple rule behind it.", "en": " 唯一自然的地方 是數字，也就是這片雲的粗糙度， 是取自自然的 有時，像雲這麼複雜的東西， 是這麼不穩定、變化多端 在它背後，應該有一個簡單的規則才是"}, {"zh-tw": " Now this simple rule is not an explanation of clouds. The seer of clouds had to take account of it.", "en": " 現在，這個簡單規則 並不是解釋雲層 看這片雲的人必須 有這個認知。"}, {"zh-tw": " I don't know how much advanced these pictures are. They're old. I was very much involved in it, but then turned my attention to other phenomena.", "en": " 我不認為這些照片有多先進， 它們很舊了 我以前涉獵極深， 但後來，我轉而研究其他現象了"}, {"zh-tw": " Now, here is another thing which is rather interesting. One of the shattering events in the history of mathematics, which is not appreciated by many people, occurred about 130 years ago, 145 years ago.", "en": " 現在，這裡有另一個 更有趣的東西 這是在數學史上一件 令人震驚的事件， 當時沒多少人理解， 發生在大約 130 年前、 或 145 年前。"}, {"zh-tw": " Mathematicians began to create shapes that didn't exist. Mathematicians got into self-praise to an extent which was absolutely amazing, that man can invent things that nature did not know.", "en": " 當時，數學家開始創造 不存在的形狀 數學家陷入一種自我耽溺的地步 他們完全沉浸於 人類發明的喜悅之中 而這些發明是自然所不知曉的事物"}, {"zh-tw": " In particular, it could invent things like a curve which fills the plane. A curve's a curve, a plane's a plane, and the two won't mix.", "en": " 特別是，發明一種 可以填補平面的曲線 曲線是曲線，平面是平面， 兩者無法混合"}, {"zh-tw": " Well, they do mix. A man named Peano did define such curves, and it became an object of extraordinary interest.", "en": " 但事實上，他們是可以混在一起的 有一個叫 Peano 的先生 真的確立了這些曲線， 於是，這形成一個當時多數人極感興趣的研究對象"}, {"zh-tw": " It was very important, but mostly interesting because a kind of break, a separation between the mathematics coming from reality, on the one hand, and new mathematics coming from pure man's mind. Well, I was very sorry to point out that the pure man's mind has, in fact, seen at long last what had been seen for a long time.", "en": " 它在當時非常重要，但也相當有趣 因為，一種突破 必須是一種區隔， 它區隔來自描述現實現象的數學 與來自人類純粹心智的新數學 嗯，我必須很遺憾地指出 純粹的人類心智 事實上 最終見到了 他們長久以來視而不見的事物"}, {"zh-tw": " And so here I introduce something, the set of rivers of a plane-filling curve. And well, it's a story unto itself.", "en": " 所以，在這裡，我要向大家介紹 一組河流的平面填充曲線 而且 它本身就是一個故事。"}, {"zh-tw": " So it was in 1875 to 1925, an extraordinary period in which mathematics prepared itself to break out from the world. And the objects which were used as examples, when I was a child and a student, as examples of the break between mathematics and visible reality -- those objects, I turned them completely around.", "en": " 1875 年到 1925 年 是一段了不起的時期 在這段期間，數學正準備突破自己的世界， 當我還是個小孩、學生的時候 當時作為範例的 物體 區分了數學與 可見的現實—— 我把那些物體 完全顛倒過來"}, {"zh-tw": " I used them for describing some of the aspects of the complexity of nature. Well, a man named Hausdorff in 1919 introduced a number which was just a mathematical joke, and I found that this number was a good measurement of roughness.", "en": " 我把它們用來描述 自然的若干繁複面向 1919 年，有一位叫做 Hausdorff 的先生 引介了一個數字，這個數字在當時被看作數學玩笑 但我發現這個數值 卻是衡量粗糙度的好工具"}, {"zh-tw": " When I first told it to my friends in mathematics they said, \"Don't be silly. It's just something [silly].\" Well actually, I was not silly. The great painter Hokusai knew it very well.", "en": " 當我第一次把這個發現告訴我數學界的朋友時， 他們說：「別傻了，那只不過是件無聊蠢事。」 然而事實上，我當時並不傻， 偉大的畫家葛飾北齋（Hokusai）深知這個道理"}, {"zh-tw": " The things on the ground are algae. He did not know the mathematics; it didn't yet exist.", "en": " 這些涉及複數的問題 他不懂數學，那時數學尚未存在"}, {"zh-tw": " And he was Japanese who had no contact with the West. But painting for a long time had a fractal side.", "en": " 他是個日本人，從未接觸過西方世界 但長久以來，他的畫作擁有碎形面"}, {"zh-tw": " I could speak of that for a long time. The Eiffel Tower has a fractal aspect.", "en": " 我可以花很多時間談論這個 艾菲爾鐵塔有個碎形的外觀"}, {"zh-tw": " I read the book that Mr. Eiffel wrote about his tower, and indeed it was astonishing how much he understood. This is a mess, mess, mess, Brownian loop.", "en": " 我在書上讀到，埃菲爾先生寫過他的鐵塔 確實，令人驚訝地，他非常瞭解碎型 這是一個混亂、混亂、混亂的布朗寧迴圈"}, {"zh-tw": " One day I decided -- halfway through my career, I was held by so many things in my work -- I decided to test myself. Could I just look at something which everybody had been looking at for a long time and find something dramatically new? Well, so I looked at these things called Brownian motion -- just goes around.", "en": " 有一天，在我職業生涯的半途 我發現 我的工作被許多事情絆住 我決定測試自己 看我是否可以 從每個人看了許久的事物中 發現什麽戲劇化的新東西？ 嗯，於是我看到了這些 叫布朗寧運動的東西，只有一圈"}, {"zh-tw": " I played with it for a while, and I made it return to the origin. Then I was telling my assistant, \"I don't see anything. Can you paint it?\" So he painted it, which means he put inside everything. He said: \"Well, this thing came out ...\" And I said, \"Stop! Stop! Stop! I see; it's an island.\" And amazing.", "en": " 我和它玩了一會， 我使它回到原點 接著，我告訴我的助理： 「我看不到任何東西。你能把它畫出來嗎？」 於是他畫了出來，這意謂著 他把所有都放了進去。他說： 「這東西出現了......」我說：「停下來! 停下來! 停下來! 我明白了，這是一座島嶼。」 多麼驚人"}, {"zh-tw": " So Brownian motion, which happens to have a roughness number of two, goes around. I measured it, 1.33.", "en": " 因此，布朗寧運動剛好有 一個粗糙度數字2，它繞了一圈 我測量它，是1.33"}, {"zh-tw": " Again, again, again. Long measurements, big Brownian motions, 1.33.", "en": " 一而再，再而三 長尺寸，大的布朗寧運動， 1.33"}, {"zh-tw": " Mathematical problem: how to prove it? It took my friends 20 years. Three of them were having incomplete proofs.", "en": " 一個數學問題來了：該如何證明它？ 我的朋友曾花 20 年的時間研究 他們三個人產出一個不完全的證明"}, {"zh-tw": " They got together, and together they had the proof.

What got you in that strange business?\" What got you to be, at the same time, a mechanical engineer, a geographer and a mathematician and so on, a physicist? Well actually I started, oddly enough, studying stock market prices. And so here I had this theory, and I wrote books about it -- financial prices increments.", "en": " 現在，每個人都問我 「這是怎麼開始的？ 是什麼原因使你進入這個陌生的領域？」 是什麼讓我 同時成為一個機械工程師、 又成為地理學家、 數學家、或物理學家等等？ 嗯，事實上，我是從一個非常怪異的地方開始的 我研究股票市場價格 在這 我提過理論 我也寫了有關這方面的書籍 金融價格增長量"}, {"zh-tw": " To the left you see data over a long period. To the right, on top, you see a theory which is very, very fashionable.", "en": " 在左邊，你們看到長期的數據 在右邊，上方 你們可以看到一個非常、非常流行的理論"}, {"zh-tw": " It was very easy, and you can write many books very fast about it. There are thousands of books on that.", "en": " 它非常簡單，你可以用極短的時間寫下許多關於它的書籍 坊間有上千本這方面的著作"}, {"zh-tw": " Now compare that with real price increments. Where are real price increments? Well, these other lines include some real price increments and some forgery which I did.", "en": " 現在，比較真實的價格增加量， 哪裡是實際的價格增加量呢？ 嗯，其他這些曲線 包涵了一些真正的價格利潤 還有一些是我偽造的"}, {"zh-tw": " So the idea there was that one must be able to -- how do you say? -- model price variation. And it went really well 50 years ago.", "en": " 所以，這裡的觀點是 人們必須能夠 --怎麼說呢？ -- 把價格變化模組化 在五十年前，這觀點被認為相當有道理"}, {"zh-tw": " For 50 years, people were sort of pooh-poohing me because they could do it much, much easier. But I tell you, at this point, people listened to me.", "en": " 五十年來，人們多少有點輕視我的看法 因為他們可以用非常簡單的方式換算出來 但我告訴你，在這一點上，人們聽信我"}, {"zh-tw": " These two curves are averages: Standard & Poor, the blue one; and the red one is Standard & Poor's from which the five biggest discontinuities are taken out.
