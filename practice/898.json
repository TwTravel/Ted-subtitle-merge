And I'm going to talk about some of those consequences and just present a whole bunch of really interesting projects that I think give us tremendous reasons to be really optimistic that the big design and development project of the next 50 years is going to be retrofitting suburbia.", "en": " 在過去的五十年中 我們一直在建設郊區 帶來了許多意想不到的後果 我今天就要來談談其中的一些 並向各位介紹一系列非常有意思的計劃 使我們有充份的理由 信心十足 在接下來的50年中，重要的設計開發計畫 將會是郊區改造"}, {"zh-tw": " So whether it's redeveloping dying malls or re-inhabiting dead big-box stores or reconstructing wetlands out of parking lots, I think the fact is the growing number of empty and under-performing, especially retail, sites throughout suburbia gives us actually a tremendous opportunity to take our least-sustainable landscapes right now and convert them into more sustainable places. And in the process, what that allows us to do is to redirect a lot more of our growth back into existing communities that could use a boost, and have the infrastructure in place, instead of continuing to tear down trees and to tear up the green space out at the edges.", "en": " 不論是重建衰落的購物中心 重新利用關掉的超級廣場 或者是在停車場上 重建濕地 我認為事實上 越來越多 空置和不景氣的 尤其是零售場所 散佈在城市郊區 為我們提供了一個絕好的機會 讓我們把目前最不永續 的建築形式 改造成 可永續發展的空間 這個過程使我們能夠 更多的把經濟增長 引導到需要幫助的 現有的社區去 幫助其完善基礎設施 而不是繼續 砍伐樹木 或者毀掉週邊的綠地"}, {"zh-tw": " So why is this important? I think there are any number of reasons, and I'm just going to not get into detail but mention a few. Just from the perspective of climate change, the average urban dweller in the U.S.", "en": " 這為什麼很重要? 我想有諸多原因 我不想詳述細節﹐只提幾點就好 僅從氣候變化的角度來看 在美國一個普通城市居民"}, {"zh-tw": " has about one-third the carbon footprint of the average suburban dweller, mostly because suburbanites drive a lot more, and living in detached buildings, you have that much more exterior surface to leak energy out of. So strictly from a climate change perspective, the cities are already relatively green.", "en": " 留下的碳足跡 相當於一個郊區居民的三分之一 很大程度上因為郊區居民開車更頻繁 而且住獨立房屋 他們有更多的戶外表面 導致更多能源泄漏 所以嚴格從 氣候變化的角度來講 城市本身 更加節能"}, {"zh-tw": " The big opportunity to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is actually in urbanizing the suburbs. All that driving that we've been doing out in the suburbs, we have doubled the amount of miles we drive.", "en": " 減少溫室氣體排放 的一個良機 實際上就是 郊區城市化 我們在郊區要經常駕駛汽車 我們駕駛的英里數已經翻倍"}, {"zh-tw": " It's increased our dependence on foreign oil despite the gains in fuel efficiency. We're just driving so much more; we haven't been able to keep up technologically.", "en": " 這使我們更加依賴 從外國進口的石油 儘管汽車燃油效率提高了 但我們比以前更長開車 我們的技術沒有跟上郊區化的速度"}, {"zh-tw": " Public health is another reason to consider retrofitting. Researchers at the CDC and other places have increasingly been linking suburban development patterns with sedentary lifestyles.", "en": " 公共衛生是 另一個考慮改造的原因 疾病控制中心和其他機構的研究者 發現越來越多的 郊區發展模式 與久坐的生活方式有關"}, {"zh-tw": " And those have been linked then with the rather alarming, growing rates of obesity, shown in these maps here, and that obesity has also been triggering great increases in heart disease and diabetes to the point where a child born today has a one-in-three chance of developing diabetes. And that rate has been escalating at the same rate as children not walking to school anymore, again, because of our development patterns.", "en": " 而這種生活方式 又與驚人的 肥胖症的增長速度相關 如地圖所示 而肥胖症又會導致 心臟病 和糖尿病的激增 以至於今天出生的嬰兒 每三個人中就有一個 有患糖尿病的機率 和這個概率同步增長的是 兒童不再走路 去學校 這又是因為我們的發展模式的問題"}, {"zh-tw": " And then there's finally -- there's the affordability question. I mean, how affordable is it to continue to live in suburbia with rising gas prices? Suburban expansion to cheap land, for the last 50 years -- you know the cheap land out on the edge -- has helped generations of families enjoy the American dream.", "en": " 最後還有支付能力的問題 隨著汽油價格不斷上漲 有多少人還能負擔得起 繼續在郊區生活? 過去的50年, 郊區向更廉價的土地擴張 城市邊緣的廉價土地 幫助好幾代家庭 實現了他們的美國夢"}, {"zh-tw": " But increasingly, the savings promised by drive-till-you-qualify affordability -- which is basically our model -- those savings are wiped out when you consider the transportation costs. For instance, here in Atlanta, about half of households make between $20,000 and $50,000 a year, and they are spending 29 percent of their income on housing and 32 percent on transportation.", "en": " 但是逐漸地﹐ “開到你能買得起為止” 這種我們的發展模式 所承諾的存款 如果算上交通費用 已經蕩然無存 比如﹐在亞特蘭大這裡 大約一半的家庭 年收入在2-5萬美元之間 他們的收入有29%花在 住房上面 有32% 花在交通上"}, {"zh-tw": " I mean, that's 2005 figures. That's before we got up to the four bucks a gallon.", "en": " 這是2005年的數字 是在汽油價格漲到四美元一加侖之前"}, {"zh-tw": " You know, none of us really tend to do the math on our transportation costs, and they're not going down any time soon.

I think it is. June Williamson and I have been researching this topic for over a decade, and we've found over 80 varied projects.", "en": " 但是否可行? 我認為可行 瓊.威廉姆森和我研究這個課題 十多年了 我們已經找到八十多個 不同的項目"}, {"zh-tw": " But that they're really all market driven, and what's driving the market in particular -- number one -- is major demographic shifts. We all tend to think of suburbia as this very family-focused place, but that's really not the case anymore.", "en": " 實際上這些項目都是受市場驅動的 驅動市場的主要因素是 第一是顯著的人口變化 多數人都認為郊區 是一個以家庭為中心的地方 實際已經不是這樣了"}, {"zh-tw": " Since 2000, already two-thirds of households in suburbia did not have kids in them. We just haven't caught up with the actual realities of this.", "en": " 從2000年以來 郊區三分之二的家庭 是沒有孩子的 我們只是尚未認識到現實而已"}, {"zh-tw": " The reasons for this have a lot to with the dominance of the two big demographic groups right now: the Baby Boomers retiring -- and then there's a gap, Generation X, which is a small generation. They're still having kids -- but Generation Y hasn't even started hitting child-rearing age.", "en": " 這裡面的原因在很大程度上 同佔據主要地位的 兩個人口群體有關 嬰兒潮世代的人正退休中 接下來有一個斷層 X世代是人數較少的一代 他們仍在生育年齡 Y世代還尚未開始 他們的生育期"}, {"zh-tw": " They're the other big generation. So as a result of that, demographers predict that through 2025, 75 to 85 percent of new households will not have kids in them.", "en": " 他們將是人數龐大的一代 因此 人口學家預測 從現在到2025年 75%到85%的新家庭 將沒有孩子"}, {"zh-tw": " And the market research, consumer research, asking the Boomers and Gen Y what it is they would like, what they would like to live in, tells us there is going to be a huge demand -- and we're already seeing it -- for more urban lifestyles within suburbia. That basically, the Boomers want to be able to age in place, and Gen Y would like to live an urban lifestyle, but most of their jobs will continue to be out in suburbia.", "en": " 市場和消費者研究 調查嬰兒潮世代和Y世代 他們想要什麼 想要居住在什麼樣的地方 結果顯示未來需求旺盛的是 -- 我們已經開始觀察到 -- 郊區居民 對城市生活方式的需求 嬰兒潮世代想安渡晚年 Y世代想往 城市生活方式 但是他們當中大部份人的工作仍舊在郊區"}, {"zh-tw": " The other big dynamic of change is the sheer performance of underperforming asphalt. Now I keep thinking this would be a great name for an indie rock band, but developers generally use it to refer to underused parking lots -- and suburbia is full of them.", "en": " 另外一個巨大的變化 有關不盡人意的 瀝青的表現 我覺得這會是個很棒的 獨立搖滾樂隊的名字 不過開發商一般用來指 使用率不高的停車場 在郊區隨處可見"}, {"zh-tw": " When the postwar suburbs were first built out on the cheap land away from downtown, it made sense to just build surface parking lots. But those sites have now been leapfrogged and leapfrogged again, as we've just continued to sprawl, and they now have a relatively central location.", "en": " 戰後在廉價的土地上 剛開始建設郊區時 遠離市區 修地面停車場 合情合理 但如今這些地方已經被一輪又一輪的郊區擴張 超越過去 我們的城市不斷擴張 這些昔日的遠郊 現在已是相對的中心位置"}, {"zh-tw": " It no longer just makes sense. That land is more valuable than just surface parking lots.", "en": " 土地的價值已經上漲 繼續修建地面停車場不再划算"}, {"zh-tw": " It now makes sense to go back in, build a deck and build up on those sites. So what do you do with a dead mall, dead office park? It turns out, all sorts of things.", "en": " 合理的做法是 在這些場地 修建多層建築 那麼怎麼樣處理 閒置的購物中心﹐ 或辦公園區? 其實處理方法很多"}, {"zh-tw": " In a slow economy like ours, re-inhabitation is one of the more popular strategies.

It's not pulling in as much tax revenue as it once was, but it's serving its community.", "en": " 這裡目前駐有藝術工作室 戲劇和舞蹈團體 雖然這個場所現在稅收收入 不如從前 但是它服務本地社區"}, {"zh-tw": " It's keeping the lights on. It's becoming, I think, a really great institution.", "en": " 能夠繼續發揮作用 它正在變成一個不錯的機構"}, {"zh-tw": " Other malls have been re-inhabited as nursing homes, as universities, and as all variety of office space. We also found a lot of examples of dead big-box stores that have been converted into all sorts of community-serving uses as well -- lots of schools, lots of churches and lots of libraries like this one.", "en": " 其他購物中心有被改造為 療養院 有的成為大學 和其他各種辦公場地 我們也看到許多 關閉的超級廣場 被改造成為 各種社區服務機構 許多學校﹐和教會 還有像這樣的圖書館"}, {"zh-tw": " This was a little grocery store, a Food Lion grocery store, that is now a public library. In addition to, I think, doing a beautiful adaptive reuse, they tore up some of the parking spaces, put in bioswales to collect and clean the runoff, put in a lot more sidewalks to connect to the neighborhoods.", "en": " 這裡以前是一家小雜貨店﹐ 獅子食品雜貨店 現在成為公共圖書館 除了成功的改造再利用以外 他們還拆除掉一些停車位 修建了過濾地表徑流污水的設施 增加了更多人行道 把鄰里聯接起來"}, {"zh-tw": " And they've made this, what was just a store along a commercial strip, into a community gathering space. This one is a little L-shaped strip shopping center in Phoenix, Arizona.", "en": " 他們就這樣 把過去商街上的一個商店 變成了一個社區集會的場所 這是亞歷桑那州鳳凰城的 一個L形的商街"}, {"zh-tw": " Really all they did was they gave it a fresh coat of bright paint, a gourmet grocery, and they put up a restaurant in the old post office. Never underestimate the power of food to turn a place around and make it a destination.", "en": " 他們僅僅把它用鮮亮的顏色重新粉刷一遍 開了一家美食食品店 在原來的郵局開了一家餐館 決不要低估美食的力量 它可以讓一個地方起死回生 變成一個令人嚮往的勝地"}, {"zh-tw": " It's been so successful, they've now taken over the strip across the street. The real estate ads in the neighborhood all very proudly proclaim, \"Walking distance to Le Grande Orange,\" because it provided its neighborhood with what sociologists like to call \"a third place.\" If home is the first place and work is the second place, the third place is where you go to hang out and build community.", "en": " 這個改造如此成功﹐他們現在把對街的店鋪也拿下來 這一帶的房屋銷售廣告 也驕傲的宣稱 “步行就可以到‘大桔子美食城’” 因為它為周圍社區提供了 一個社會學家所稱的 “第三空間” 如果家是第一空間 工作場所是第二空間 第三空間就是可以放鬆 培養社區關係的地方"}, {"zh-tw": " And especially as suburbia is becoming less centered on the family, the family households, there's a real hunger for more third places. So the most dramatic retrofits are really those in the next category, the next strategy: redevelopment.", "en": " 特別是郊區漸漸的 不以家庭為中心、 不以家庭為單位 民眾更渴求 更多的第三空間 所以最徹底的改造 其實是下面一種類型 就是重新開發"}, {"zh-tw": " Now, during the boom, there were several really dramatic redevelopment projects where the original building was scraped to the ground and then the whole site was rebuilt at significantly greater density, a sort of compact, walkable urban neighborhoods. But some of them have been much more incremental.", "en": " 在改造的高峰期﹐有很多 改造幅度很大的重新開發工程 原有的建築 被夷為平地﹐整個場地被重建 建築物密度大大增加 居住區比較集中﹐方便步行 另外一些工程則採取循序漸進的方式"}, {"zh-tw": " This is Mashpee Commons, the oldest retrofit that we've found. And it's just incrementally, over the last 20 years, built urbanism on top of its parking lots.", "en": " 這是馬什皮村 我們找到的最早的改造計畫 這個計畫在過去的20年中逐步地 在停車場上面 打造了都市生活方式"}, {"zh-tw": " So the black and white photo shows the simple 60's strip shopping center. And then the maps above that show its gradual transformation into a compact, mixed-use New England village, and it has plans now that have been approved for it to connect to new residential neighborhoods across the arterials and over to the other side.", "en": " 黑白照片顯示的 是它六十年代時簡陋的商街 它上面的地圖 顯示出它逐漸的變成 一個緊湊的 多用途的新英格蘭村落 目前它好幾項規劃已經獲得許可 這個村落將和 新的居住區連接起來 跨越主幹道 延伸到對面去"}, {"zh-tw": " So, you know, sometimes it's incremental. Sometimes, it's all at once.", "en": " 所以﹐有時改造是循序漸進的 有時大刀闊斧"}, {"zh-tw": " This is another infill project on the parking lots, this one of an office park outside of Washington D.C. When Metrorail expanded transit into the suburbs and opened a station nearby to this site, the owners decided to build a new parking deck and then insert on top of their surface lots a new Main Street, several apartments and condo buildings, while keeping the existing office buildings.", "en": " 這是另一個停車場改造的工程 這是華盛頓特區郊外的一個辦公園區 當地鐵將公交線路擴展到郊區 並在附近設立了車站 業主決定 修建一座立體停車場 然後在空出的場地增加了 一條主街, 數座公寓 和分契公寓 同時保留現有的辦公大樓"}, {"zh-tw": " Here is the site in 1940: It was just a little farm in the village of Hyattsville.

Eventually, I expect that the streets will probably extend through a redevelopment of the mall.", "en": " 今天﹐交通運輸、 主街和新的房屋 已經完全建成了 最終﹐我估計街道 將會貫穿整個改造後的購物中心"}, {"zh-tw": " Plans have already been announced for a lot of those garden apartments above the mall to be redeveloped. Transit is a big driver of retrofits.", "en": " 已經有宣佈 改造購物中心上面 帶花園的公寓的計劃 交通是郊區改造的一大驅動力"}, {"zh-tw": " So here's what it looks like. You can sort of see the funky new condo buildings in between the office buildings and the public space and the new Main Street.", "en": " 它看起來是這樣 差不多可以看到時髦的公寓 夾雜在辦公大樓中間 還有公共場所和新的主街"}, {"zh-tw": " This one is one of my favorites, Belmar.

This was a very large mall on a hundred-acre superblock.", "en": " 屋頂上密佈著太陽能電池板 還有風力發電葉片 這曾經是巨大的購物中心 佔地一百英畝的超級街區"}, {"zh-tw": " It's now 22 walkable urban blocks with public streets, two public parks, eight bus lines and a range of housing types, and so it's really given Lakewood, Colorado the downtown that this particular suburb never had. Here was the mall in its heyday.", "en": " 現在是22個 方便步行的城市街區 有公共街道 兩個公園﹐八條公車路線 和各式各樣的房屋類型 如此以來﹐科羅拉多的雷克伍德 擁有了一個市中心 這是這片郊區從來沒有過的 這是購物中心的鼎盛時期"}, {"zh-tw": " They had their prom in the mall. They loved their mall. So here's the site in 1975 with the mall.", "en": " 在這裡舉行高中生舞會. 人們熱愛這購物中心 這是1975年時的情景 購物中心還在"}, {"zh-tw": " By 1995, the mall has died. The department store has been kept -- and we found this was true in many cases.", "en": " 到1995年﹐購物中心關閉了 但百貨商店保留了下來 我們發現這個現象很常見"}, {"zh-tw": " The department stores are multistory; they're better built. They're easy to be re-adapted.", "en": " 百貨商店是多層建築﹐ 他們構造更結實 很容易改造"}, {"zh-tw": " But the one story stuff ... that's really history.", "en": " 但那些一層建築 早就成為歷史了"}, {"zh-tw": " So here it is at projected build-out. This project, I think, has great connectivity to the existing neighborhoods.", "en": " 這裡顯示的是擴建規劃 這個計畫能夠很好地 跟現有社區連接起來"}, {"zh-tw": " It's providing 1,500 households with the option of a more urban lifestyle.

It's very successful, and it's helped to prompt -- eight of the 13 regional malls in Denver have now, or have announced plans to be, retrofitted.", "en": " 這是主街的樣子 這個工程非常成功 它已經促使丹佛市的 13個地區性購物中心 其中的八個 即將計劃 進行改造"}, {"zh-tw": " But it's important to note that all of this retrofitting is not occurring -- just bulldozers are coming and just plowing down the whole city. No, it's pockets of walkability on the sites of under-performing properties.", "en": " 重要的是要知道這種改造 不僅僅是 推土機把整個城市夷為平地而已 而是在收益不高的地產上 建設 小片可步行的社區"}, {"zh-tw": " And so it's giving people more choices, but it's not taking away choices. But it's also not really enough to just create pockets of walkability.", "en": " 這樣提供給大眾更多的選擇 而不是剝奪他們的選擇 但是僅僅建設這些分散的 方便步行的地方還不夠"}, {"zh-tw": " You want to also try to get more systemic transformation. We need to also retrofit the corridors themselves.", "en": " 我們還應該開始更系統的改變 我們需要改造交通幹道本身"}, {"zh-tw": " So this is one that has been retrofitted in California. They took the commercial strip shown on the black-and-white images below, and they built a boulevard that has become the Main Street for their town.", "en": " 這就是一個在加州 改造的工程 他們把下面黑白照片中 的小商街 改造成為一條大道 成為他們城鎮的主街"}, {"zh-tw": " And it's transformed from being an ugly, unsafe, undesirable address, to becoming a beautiful, attractive, dignified sort of good address. I mean now we're hoping we start to see it; they've already built City Hall, attracted two hotels.", "en": " 它從一個 醜陋﹐不安全 不受歡迎的地段 變成了一個美麗 迷人﹐有身價的地段 我們希望看到這樣的變化 他們已經建好了市政府﹐吸引了兩座飯店"}, {"zh-tw": " I could imagine beautiful housing going up along there without tearing down another tree.

When the shopping center died, the city restored the site's original wetlands, creating lakefront property, which then attracted private investment, the first private investment to this very low-income neighborhood in over 40 years.", "en": " 但重新綠化最重要的方面 也許是能夠重建 當地生態環境的機會 正如明尼愛普樂斯市郊的這個例子 當購物中心倒閉後 市政府恢復了 原來的濕地 創造了臨湖的地產 由此而吸引了私人投資 是這個低收入社區 四十年來的第一筆私人投資"}, {"zh-tw": " So they've managed to both restore the local ecology and the local economy at the same time. This is another re-greening example.", "en": " 他們因此得以同時恢復當地生態環境 和重建當地經濟 這是另一個重新綠化的個例"}, {"zh-tw": " It also makes sense in very strong markets. This one in Seattle is on the site of a mall parking lot adjacent to a new transit stop.", "en": " 在市場良好的地區同樣適用 在西雅圖的這個工程 是在一個購物中心的停車場上 它緊挨著一個新的交通點"}, {"zh-tw": " And the wavy line is a path alongside a creek that has now been daylit. The creek had been culverted under the parking lot.", "en": " 這條曲線 是一條溪邊小路, 小溪剛被恢復原貌 之前它從停車場下面的涵洞流過"}, {"zh-tw": " But daylighting our creeks really improves their water quality and contributions to habitat. So I've shown you some of the first generation of retrofits.", "en": " 溪流重新回到地上 很大的改善了水質 和生存環境 那麼我已經展示給大家 一些第一代的改造工程"}, {"zh-tw": " What's next? I think we have three challenges for the future. The first is to plan retrofitting much more systemically at the metropolitan scale.", "en": " 下一步會怎樣? 我想未來有三個挑戰 第一是改造規劃 在都市化的規模上 更加系統"}, {"zh-tw": " We need to be able to target which areas really should be re-greened.
