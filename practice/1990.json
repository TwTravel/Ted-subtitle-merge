You come with him.\" Harold and I arrive in New York.", "en": " 那是在2006年 我的朋友Harold Ford給我打電話 他正在競選田納西州美國參議員 他說：「Mellody，我現在非常需要接觸全國性的媒體，你有什麼辦法嗎？ 」 我想到了一個主意，於是給一個朋友打電話 這位朋友在紐約 一家世界上最著名的媒體公司任職 她說：「為什麼不為Harold 舉辦一個媒體主編的午餐會呢？ 你和他都來參加。 」 於是Harold和我來到紐約"}, {"zh-tw": " We are in our best suits. We look like shiny new pennies.", "en": " 我們穿著最好的禮服 我們看起來像是閃閃發亮的硬幣"}, {"zh-tw": " And we get to the receptionist, and we say, \"We're here for the lunch.\" She motions for us to follow her.

There are literally no words, right?

Now I have this thought experiment that I play with myself, when I say, imagine if I walked you into a room and it was of a major corporation, like ExxonMobil, and every single person aroundthe boardroom were black, you would think that were weird.", "en": " 這就是事實 我自己的腦海裡 經常玩味著這樣一個場景 想像著我走入一個房間 是一個大公司，就像埃克森美孚 董事會房間裡的人全部都是黑人 你肯定覺得很怪異"}, {"zh-tw": " But if I walked you into a Fortune 500 company, and everyone around the table is a white male, when will it be that we think that's weird too?

And I failed a lot.", "en": " 第一次我沒能做到 不得不再試一次 結果我失敗了好多次"}, {"zh-tw": " By the end, I got it, but when I got out of the pool, I was exasperated and tired and annoyed, and I said, \"Why are we doingbreath-holding exercises?\" And my coach looked meat me, and he said, \"Mellody, that was not a breath-holding exercise. That drill was to make you comfortable being uncomfortable, because that's how most of us spend our days.\" If we can learn to deal with our discomfort, and just relax into it, we'll have a better life.", "en": " 最後我終於做到了，我爬出泳池 疲憊不堪，憤怒又氣惱 我說：「我們為什麼要做憋氣的練習？ 」 我的教練看著我，說：「Mellody， 這並不是一個憋氣的練習 這是為了讓你把不舒服 習慣成舒服 因為這是我們大部分人過日子的方式。 」 如果我們學會應對不適感 變得習以為常 我們的生活會變得更好"}, {"zh-tw": " So I think it's time for us to be comfortable with the uncomfortable conversation about race: black, white, Asian, Hispanic, male, female, all of us, if we truly believe in equal rights and equal opportunity in America, I think we have to have real conversations about this issue. We cannot afford to be color blind.", "en": " 所以我認為現在我們應該讓自己習慣 種族這個不舒服的話題 黑人、白人、亞洲人、西班牙人 男人、女人、所有的人 如果我們真正相信，在美國 有平等的權利和機會 那麼我們必須認真討論 這個話題 我們無法承受色盲的代價"}, {"zh-tw": " We have to be color brave. We have to be willing, as teachers and parents and entrepreneurs and scientists, we have to be willing to have proactive conversations about race with honesty and understanding and courage, not because it's the right thing to do, but because it's the smart thing to do, because our businesses and our products and our science, our research, all of that will be better with greater diversity.", "en": " 我們必須要「色勇 」 我們必須要有意願，作為教師和父母 企業家和科學家 我們必須有意願 針對種族問題開展前瞻性的對話 帶著坦誠、理解和勇敢的心情 不僅僅因為這是正確的事情 而且是明智的事情 因為我們的生意、產品 技術、研究 所有這些都會變得更加多樣化"}, {"zh-tw": " Now, my favorite example of color bravery is a guy named John Skipper. He runs ESPN.", "en": " 我最推崇的一個色勇榜樣 是John Skipper 他是ESPN的副總裁"}, {"zh-tw": " He's a North Carolina native, quintessential Southern gentleman, white.
