A lot of them were having troublewith math at first, because they had all of these gapsaccumulated in their learning.", "en": " 幾年前，我陪我親戚一起讀書的時候，就觀察到 他們之中很多人剛開始對數學很頭疼， 原因是他們在學習過程中，不斷積累還沒掌握的知識漏洞。"}, {"zh-tw": " And because of that, at some pointthey got to an algebra class and they might have been a little bitshaky on some of the pre-algebra, and because of that, they thoughtthey didn't have the math gene. Or they'd get to a calculus class, and they'd be a little bitshaky on the algebra.", "en": " 因此，當他們開始上代數課時， 在初級代數的課程中可能就跟不太上， 因此，他們會認為自己沒有學習數學的天賦。 或者他們之後上微積分課時， 才發現自己在代數環節上的基礎也不太好。"}, {"zh-tw": " I saw it in the early days when I was uploadingsome of those videos on YouTube, and I realized that peoplewho were not my cousins were watching.

I don't know how much timeyou all spend on YouTube.", "en": " 我認為這樣真的很棒。 我不知道你們都花多少時間在YouTube上。"}, {"zh-tw": " Most of the comments are not \"Thank you.\" They're a little edgier than that. But then the commentsgot a little more intense, student after student sayingthat they had grown up not liking math.", "en": " 因為後來大多數的留言並不是「謝謝」。 他們越來越激動了。 但之後的留言變得越來越有深度， 越來越多的學生反映，他們之前是在不喜歡數學的環境下長大。"}, {"zh-tw": " It was getting difficult as they gotinto more advanced math topics. By the time they got to algebra, they had so many gaps in their knowledgethey couldn't engage with it.", "en": " 進入高等數學後就更加痛苦了。 當他們開始上代數的時候， 他們的知識中已累積太多漏洞以至於他們無法投入在課堂之中。"}, {"zh-tw": " They thought they didn'thave the math gene.

I didn't know 25 percentof the more foundational thing, and now I'm being pushedto the more advanced thing.", "en": " 老師一直講課，然後你會突然間發現， 這一切怎麽那麽的陌生。 我明明還有25%的基礎知識不懂， 現在卻被迫繼續學更加深奧的東西。"}, {"zh-tw": " And this will continue for months, years,all the way until at some point, I might be in an algebra classor trigonometry class and I hit a wall.

We were artificially constraininghow long we had to something, pretty much ensuring a variable outcome, and we took the trouble of inspectingand identifying those gaps, but then we built right on top of it.", "en": " 但真正的問題，其實是過程的本身。 我們用人為的方式去限制完成某事的時間， 幾乎可以確定，結果一定會有落差， 然後我們檢查也發現了問題， 但卻又立刻填鴨上去。"}, {"zh-tw": " So the idea of mastery learningis to do the exact opposite. Instead of artificiallyconstraining, fixing when and how long you work on something, pretty much ensuringthat variable outcome, the A, B, C, D, F -- do it the other way around.", "en": " 掌握式教育的觀念就是去做完全相反的事。 將人為的限制、僵化、 何時學習和學多久、 確認Ａ、B、C、D、F成績 這些結果的行為， 轉換成另一種方式。"}, {"zh-tw": " What's variable is when and how long a student actually hasto work on something, and what's fixed is thatthey actually master the material.

It means that you should justkeep working on it.", "en": " 這可以讓他們體認到如果他們答錯了20％， 不代表他們骨子裏就是個 C 咖， 而是說明你還需要在這個內容上繼續努力、"}, {"zh-tw": " You should have grit;you should have perseverance; you should take agency over your learning. Now, a lot of skeptics might say,well, hey, this is all great, philosophically, this whole ideaof mastery-based learning and its connection to mindset, students taking agencyover their learning.", "en": " 你得堅持不懈、 你得拿出熱情克服學習的障礙。 現在很多懷疑的人會說，這些聽起來都很棒， 理論上來說，這套以掌握為目的教學方式 與心智的連結， 可以讓學生拿出熱情來克服學習障礙。"}, {"zh-tw": " It makes a lot of sense,but it seems impractical. To actually do it, every studentwould be on their own track.", "en": " 聽起來很有道理，但不太實際。 為了要真正的辦到這一點，每個學生都必須有自己的學習進度，"}, {"zh-tw": " It would have to be personalized, you'd have to have private tutorsand worksheets for every student. And these aren't new ideas -- there were experimentsin Winnetka, Illinois, 100 years ago, where they did mastery-based learningand saw great results, but they said it wouldn't scalebecause it was logistically difficult.", "en": " 必須有客製化的教學方式。 每個學生都要有私人教師和私人定制的練習題。 但這並不是什麽新觀念—— 在100年前的伊利諾伊州，溫內特卡市就有這樣的實驗： 他們從事了這種以掌握為目的的教學，也取得了不錯的結果， 但是他們表示很難普及化，畢竟這在邏輯上就難以實現。"}, {"zh-tw": " The teacher had to give differentworksheets to every student, give on-demand assessments. But now today, it's no longer impractical.", "en": " 老師要給每個學生不同的試題， 根據需求做出不同的評估方式。 但如今，這已經不再是不實際的問題了。"}, {"zh-tw": " We have the tools to do it. Students see an explanationat their own time and pace? There's on-demand video for that.", "en": " 我們有了工具的幫助。 學生可以按照自己的時間和步調看錄影的講解， 有很多適當的影片可以符合學生的要求。"}, {"zh-tw": " They need practice? They need feedback? There's adaptive exercisesreadily available for students. And when that happens,all sorts of neat things happen.", "en": " 他們需要練習嗎？需要反饋嗎？ 那些掌握度的評估測驗，學生都可以自行測驗。 當這些條件都能成立的時候，各種好事就會接踵而至。"}, {"zh-tw": " One, the students can actuallymaster the concepts, but they're also buildingtheir growth mindset, they're building grit, perseverance, they're taking agency over their learning.

They can get deeper masteryover the material.", "en": " 取代老師專心講解課堂內容的是 學生們可以互動學習。 他們能夠更加深入地去掌握知識。"}, {"zh-tw": " They can go into simulations,Socratic dialogue. To appreciate what we're talking about and the tragedy of lost potential here, I'd like to give a little bitof a thought experiment.", "en": " 他們能夠模仿蘇格拉底的對話， 去感悟我們所說的事情， 去體會悲劇中的失落感， 我想給各位一個小型的思維實驗。"}, {"zh-tw": " If we were to go 400 yearsinto the past to Western Europe, which even then, was one of the moreliterate parts of the planet, you would see that about 15 percentof the population knew how to read.

Even when you got that 95 percent, what was that five percent you missed? And it keeps accumulating --you get to an advanced class, all of a sudden you hit a wall and say, \"I'm not meant to be a cancer researcher; not meant to be a physicist;not meant to be a mathematician.\" I suspect that that actually is the case, but if you were allowed to be operatingin a mastery framework, if you were allowed to reallytake agency over your learning, and when you get something wrong, embrace it -- view that failureas a moment of learning -- that number, the percentthat could really master calculus or understand organic chemistry, is actually a lot closer to 100 percent. And this isn't even just a \"nice to have.\" I think it's a social imperative.", "en": " 但如果我問各位一個類似的問題： 「你們認為目前人口中有多少 是真正掌握微積分的， 或是真正懂有機化學的， 或是有能力能夠為癌症研究作出貢獻的？」 你們中的很多就會回答：「就目前的強大教育體系下 大概有個20%或30%吧。」 但假如那些判斷 僅僅是基於你們尚未掌握觀念的個人經驗， 僅僅是基於你們的自身經歷或僅是對周圍人的觀察而已呢？ 當時你就是被迫推進課堂進度， 不斷積累漏洞情況的人啊？ 即使你掌握了95%的知識， 那剩下的5%呢？ 漏洞持續積累，直到進入進階課程， 突然碰壁，然後你就會說： 「我天生就不是個癌症研究人員、 不是物理學家、不是數學家。」 我認為這就是現實情況。 但如果你能從掌握知識的視角去審視， 如果你能從培養學習動力的角度來看， 當你做錯題目的時候， 把這種失敗當作學習的一部分並坦然接受， 那真正掌握微積分的人數比例 或是真正掌握有機化學的人數比例 就會接近100%了。 而這並不僅僅只是「有人就好」的意義而已， 我認為社會急需要這些人才。"}, {"zh-tw": " We're exiting what you could callthe industrial age and we're going intothis information revolution.

Is it just going to be that very topof the pyramid, in which case, what does everyone else do? How do they operate? Or do we do somethingthat's more aspirational? Do we actually attemptto invert the pyramid, where you have a large creative class, where almost everyonecan participate as an entrepreneur, an artist, as a researcher? And I don't think that this is utopian. I really think that thisis all based on the idea that if we let peopletap into their potential by mastering concepts, by being able to exercise agencyover their learning, that they can get there.", "en": " 所以對一個社會而言，我們有一個問題： 科技帶來了新的生產力， 是誰會參與其中呢？ 是不是只有處於金字塔頂端的人？這種情況下， 其他人還能做些甚麼？ 他們會如何操作？ 或者我們是否要從事更加遠大的事業呢？ 我們是否真的願意嘗試去翻轉金字塔？ 讓我們有一大群創意人才、 讓每個人都是企業家、 藝術家，或是研究人員？ 我並不認為這是空想。 我認為這一切都建立在一個理念， 就是如果我們能夠藉由掌握概念及 激發學生的學習熱忱 來讓學生的潛力獲得十足的發揮， 這樣，他們就能夠達到理想境界。"}, {"zh-tw": " And when you think of itas just a citizen of the world, it's pretty exciting.
