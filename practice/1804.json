Because the thing is,I was constantly trying to extend my repertoire of noises to be the very maximum that it could be.", "en": " 你應該可以想像 我小時候是個奇怪的小孩。 因為我一直在不斷嘗試 拓展我聲音技能 來達到最大的可能。"}, {"zh-tw": " I was constantly experimentingwith these noises. And I'm still on that mission.", "en": " 我不斷地嘗試。 至今仍堅持不懈。"}, {"zh-tw": " I'm still trying to find every noise that I can possibly make. And the thing is, I'm a bitolder and wiser now, and I know that there's some noises I'll never be able to makebecause I'm hemmed in by my physical body,and there's things it can't do.", "en": " 我仍然在不斷探索 各種我能夠發出的聲音。 而現在的我年長了也更理智了， 知道有一些聲音 是我永遠都發不出的 因為受到我身體限制，有些事情無法實現。"}, {"zh-tw": " And there's things that noone's voice can do. For example, no one can dotwo notes at the same time.", "en": " 還有些聲音沒有人能夠發出。 例如，沒人能同時發出兩個音符。"}, {"zh-tw": " You can do two-tone singing, which monks can do, which is like... (Two-tone singing) But that's cheating.", "en": " 你可以用泛音來唱， 就像僧侶那樣，像這樣... （泛音詠唱） 但那根本不算。"}, {"zh-tw": " And it hurts your throat. So there's things you can'tdo, and these limitations on the human voice havealways really annoyed me, because beatbox is the best way of getting musical ideas out of your headand into the world, but they're sketches at best, which is what's annoyed me.", "en": " 而且嗓子會很難受。 所以有些事情你就是沒辦法做到 而這些人類聲音的限制一直以來都困擾著我， 因為口技是向世界傳播音樂理念的最佳辦法， 因為口技是向世界傳播音樂理念的最佳辦法， 但它們最多也就是音樂小品， 正是這點讓我困擾。"}, {"zh-tw": " If only, if only there was a way for these ideas to come out unimpeded by the restrictionswhich my body gives it. So I've been working with these guys, and we've made a machine.", "en": " 真希望有一種辦法 能讓這些理念暢通無阻地演繹 打破我身體的限制。 所以我和一些朋友們一起 發明了一台機器。"}, {"zh-tw": " We've made a system which is basically a live production machine, a real-time music production machine, and it enables me to, usingnothing but my voice, create music in real timeas I hear it in my head unimpeded by any physical restrictions that my body might place on me. And I'm going to show you what it can do.", "en": " 我們做了一套系統 一台現場表演的機器， 一台即時音樂創作器， 它能讓得我只憑自己的聲音 讓我腦海中的音樂 衝破身體限制 即時演繹出來。 讓我給大家展示一下它是如何做到的。"}, {"zh-tw": " And before I start making noises with it, and using it to manipulate my voice, I want to reiterate that everythingthat you're about to hear is being made by my voice. This system has -- thank you, beautiful assistant -- this system has no sounds in it itself until I start putting sounds in it, so there's no prerecordedsamples of any kind.", "en": " 在我開始用它 控制我的聲音之前， 我想重申你將要聽到的一切 都來源於我的聲音。 這套系統 謝謝你，美麗的助手- 這套系統在我把聲音輸入之前 本身並沒有任何聲音， 沒有任何事先錄製好的聲音。"}, {"zh-tw": " So once this thing really gets going, and it really starts to manglethe audio I'm putting into it, it becomes not obviousthat it is the human voice, but it is, so I'm going to takeyou through it bit by bit and start nice and simple. So the polyphony problem:I've only got one voice.", "en": " 一旦機器開始運作， 它會將我輸入的聲音進行處理， 以至於很難辨別是否是人聲， 但它是，我會帶大家一點一點來驗證 先來點簡單又大眾的。 關於多聲調的問題：我只有一種聲音。"}, {"zh-tw": " How do I get around the problem of really wanting to haveas many different voices going on at the same time. The simplest way to do itis something like this.", "en": " 我怎麼處理這個問題 讓盡可能多的聲音 同時發出來。 最簡單的方法是這樣。"}, {"zh-tw": " (Beatboxing) By dancing. It's like this. (Music) Thanks.", "en": " （口技） 用舞曲。像這樣。 （音樂） 謝謝。"}, {"zh-tw": " So that's probably the easiest way. But if you want to do somethinga little bit more immediate, something that you can'tachieve with live looping, there's other ways to layer your voice up.", "en": " 這應該算是最簡單的辦法。 但如果你想要嘗試更即時的效果， 超越一人即時錄播產生的效果， 還有其它方法可以形成更多聲音層次。"}, {"zh-tw": " There's things like pitch-shifting, which are awesome, and I'm going to show younow what that sounds like. So I'm going to startanother beat for you, like this.", "en": " 比如通過音高平移， 這個方法非常棒， 我現在向大家展示一下效果。 我會從一個新節奏開始，像這樣。"}, {"zh-tw": " (Beatboxing) There's always got to be a bitof a dance at the start, because it's just fun, so you can clap along if you want. You don't have to. It's fine.Check it out.", "en": " （口技） 剛開始總是充滿舞曲風格， 這樣非常有趣， 你可以隨著音樂拍手。 不願意也沒關係。聽好了。"}, {"zh-tw": " I'm going to lay down a bass sound now. (Music) And now, a rockabilly guitar.", "en": " 我現在會加入一段低音。 （音樂） 現在再加入一段鄉村搖滾吉他。"}, {"zh-tw": " Which is nice. But what if I wantto make, say, a --  -- Thanks. What if I wantto make, say, a rock organ? Is that possible? Yes, it is, by recording myself like this. (Organ sound) And now I have that, I have that recorded.", "en": " 這樣不錯。但如果我想要... 謝謝。如果我想要做一段搖滾風琴的聲音怎麼辦？ 可以做到嗎？沒錯， 把我的聲音這樣錄製下來就可以。 （風琴聲） 現在我把它錄下來了。"}, {"zh-tw": " Assign it to a keyboard. (Music) So that's cool.", "en": " 再配一段電子琴。 （音樂） 這樣很酷。"}, {"zh-tw": " But what if I wanted to soundlike the whole of Pink Floyd? Impossible, you say. No. It is possible, and youcan do it very simply using this machine. It's really fantastic.Check it out.", "en": " 但如果我想要做出整個平克·弗洛伊德樂團，這樣可能嗎？ 你會說不可能。錯了。 完全有可能。這台機器很簡單就能實現。 真的非常贊。聽好了。"}, {"zh-tw": " (Music) So every noise you canhear there is my voice. I didn't just trigger somethingwhich sounds like that.", "en": " （音樂） 你聽到的所有聲音都源自我的聲音。 而不是我把這樣的音樂打開了。"}, {"zh-tw": " There's no samples.There's no synthesizers. That is literally all my voicebeing manipulated, and when you get to that point,you have to ask, don't you, what's the point? Why do this? Because it's cheaper than hiringthe whole of Pink Floyd, I suppose, is the easy answer.", "en": " 因為沒有帶子，也沒有合成器。 這是實實在在由我的聲音變化而來， 這個時候，你不禁要問， 這有什麽意義？ 爲什麽要做這些？ 因為這比請平克·弗洛伊德樂團來要便宜。 我想這是最簡答的回答。"}, {"zh-tw": " But in actual fact,I haven't made this machine so that I can emulatethings that already exist. I've made this so that I can make any noise that I can imagine.", "en": " 但事實是，我創造這台機器的目的 並非模仿已存在的各種聲音。 我創造它的目的是 把我想像中的聲音變成現實。"}, {"zh-tw": " So with your permission, I'm going to do some things that are in my mind, and I hope you enjoy them, because they're rather unusual, especially when you'redoing things which are as unusual as this, itcan be hard to believe that it is all my voice, you see. (Voice effects) (Music) Like this.", "en": " 如果大家願意， 我將把我腦海中的聲音演繹出來， 希望大家會喜歡， 因為它們是如此特別， 特別是當你的聲音變成這樣 真的很難相信 這原來是我的聲音。 （音效） （音樂） 像這樣。"}, {"zh-tw": " (Music) So, loosely defined, that is what's possiblewith the human voice. Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.", "en": " （音樂） 所以，簡而言之， 人類的聲音就是這樣充滿了可能性。 謝謝大家。"}], "title": "Beardyman The Polyphonic Me"}
