In 13 months, I flew to 14 countries and gave some hundred talks. Every talk in every country began with an introduction, and every introduction began,alas, with a lie: \"Taiye Selasi comesfrom Ghana and Nigeria,\" or \"Taiye Selasi comesfrom England and the States.\" Whenever I heard this opening sentence, no matter the country that concluded it -- England, America, Ghana, Nigeria -- I thought, \"But that's not true.\" Yes, I was born in Englandand grew up in the United States."}, {"zh-tw": "我媽媽出生於英國，在奈及利亞長大，現在住在迦納。我父親生在英國殖民地黃金海岸，在迦納長大，然後在沙烏地阿拉伯住了 30 多年。", "en": "My mum, born in England,and raised in Nigeria, currently lives in Ghana. My father was born in Gold Coast,a British colony, raised in Ghana, and has lived for over 30 yearsin the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia."}, {"zh-tw": "因為這個原因，我的介紹人也常形容我為「跨國的」。但是耐吉 (Nike) 才是跨國的，我想著，「我是人。」然後，簽書之旅的某一天，我到了丹麥的路易斯安納現代美術館，與作家科拉姆·麥卡恩同台。我們討論了「地方」對寫作有什麼作用，突然間我領悟了！", "en": "For this reason, my introducersalso called me \"multinational.\" \"But Nike is multinational,\" I thought, \"I'm a human being.\" Then, one fine day, mid-tour, I went to Louisiana, a museum in Denmark where I shared the stagewith the writer Colum McCann. We were discussing the roleof locality in writing, when suddenly it hit me."}, {"zh-tw": "我不是跨國的。我根本就不屬於哪個國家。", "en": "I'm not multinational. I'm not a national at all."}, {"zh-tw": "我怎麼會來自某個國家呢？一個「人」怎麼能來自一個「概念」呢？這個問題困擾了我二十年。從報紙、課本、談話中，我學到我們在談國家時，好像它們是永恆、獨一、自然發生的東西，但是我不懂：說我來自某個國家，意思是那個國家是個絕對實體，時空下的某個固定點，是持續不變的東西。但是真的是這樣嗎？在我一生中，我看過消失的國家——捷克斯洛伐克；出現的東帝汶；失敗的索馬利亞。", "en": "How could I come from a nation? How can a human being come from a concept? It's a question that had been bothering mefor going on two decades. From newspapers, textbooks, conversations, I had learned to speak of countries as if they were eternal, singular,naturally occurring things, but I wondered: to say that I came from a country suggested that the countrywas an absolute, some fixed point in place in time, a constant thing, but was it? In my lifetime, countrieshad disappeared -- Czechoslovakia; appeared -- Timor-Leste;failed -- Somalia."}, {"zh-tw": "我雙親的國家在他們出生時還不存在。對我而言，國家會誕生、死亡、擴張、縮小，實在不能拿來當作瞭解人的基礎。", "en": "My parents came from countriesthat didn't exist when they were born. To me, a country -- this thing that couldbe born, die, expand, contract -- hardly seemed the basisfor understanding a human being."}, {"zh-tw": "所以我發現「主權國家」時真是鬆了一口氣。我們現在所稱的國家，其實是「主權國家地位」的各種說法，這個想法在400 年前才流行起來。", "en": "And so it came as a huge reliefto discover the sovereign state. What we call countries are actually various expressionsof sovereign statehood, an idea that came into fashiononly 400 years ago."}, {"zh-tw": "當我學到這一點，那時我剛開始修國際關係碩士，我真的覺得如釋重負。就像我猜想的一樣。", "en": "When I learned this, beginning mymasters degree in international relations, I felt a sort of surge of relief. It was as I had suspected."}, {"zh-tw": "歷史是真實的，文化是真實的，但國家是人編造的。接下來十年，我尋求重新定義，或說從定義中釋放自己，我的世界、我的工作、我的經歷都超越國家這種邏輯。", "en": "History was real, cultures were real, but countries were invented. For the next 10 years, I soughtto re- or un-define myself, my world, my work, my experience, beyond the logic of the state."}, {"zh-tw": "2005 年，我寫了一篇論文，「什麼是大非洲人？」描繪一種以文化而非國家定義出的身分。我很興奮有很多人能認同我的經驗，也很受教，因為很多人無法接受我的自我感覺。", "en": "In 2005, I wrote an essay,\"What is an Afropolitan,\" sketching out an identitythat privileged culture over country. It was thrilling how many peoplecould relate to my experience, and instructional how many othersdidn't buy my sense of self."}, {"zh-tw": "有個評論這麼說：「泰雅思怎能自稱是迦納人，如果她從未嘗過拿著迦納護照出國旅行要受的屈辱？」現在，如果我誠實，我想說我瞭解她的意思。我有個朋友叫蕾拉，她在迦納出生長大。", "en": "\"How can Selasi claim to come from Ghana,\"one such critic asked, \"when she's never known the indignities of traveling abroadon a Ghanian passport?\" Now, if I'm honest, I knew just what she meant. I've got a friend named Laylawho was born and raised in Ghana."}, {"zh-tw": "她的父母是第三代黎巴嫩裔迦納人。蕾拉說著一口流利的方言契維語，對首都阿克拉瞭若指掌，但是我們數年前第一次見面時，我想著，「她才不是迦納人。」在我心中，她是黎巴嫩人，即使她過去的形成經驗都在阿克拉郊區發生。", "en": "Her parents are third-generationGhanians of Lebanese descent. Layla, who speaks fluent Twi,knows Accra like the back of her hand, but when we first met years ago,I thought, \"She's not from Ghana.\" In my mind, she came from Lebanon, despite the patent factthat all her formative experience took place in suburban Accra."}, {"zh-tw": "我，就像評論我的人一樣，想像迦納人都是棕色皮膚，而且他們都沒有英國護照。我陷入一種設限狀態，即我們都來自某個國家的說法，享受來自某個虛構、單一國家的殊榮，而非現實：人類經驗。", "en": "I, like my critics, was imagining some Ghanawhere all Ghanaians had brown skin or none held U.K. passports. I'd fallen into the limiting trap that the language of comingfrom countries sets -- the privileging of a fiction,the singular country, over reality: human experience."}, {"zh-tw": "那天與科拉姆·麥卡恩的一席對談，終於讓我了解這件事。「所有的經驗都與地方有關，」他這麼說。", "en": "Speaking with Colum McCann that day,the penny finally dropped. \"All experience is local,\" he said."}, {"zh-tw": "「所有的身分都與經歷有關」，我這麼想。「我不是哪國國民，」我在台上這麼宣稱。", "en": "\"All identity is experience,\" I thought. \"I'm not a national,\"I proclaimed onstage."}, {"zh-tw": "「我是某地的居民。我是跨地方的。」你看，說泰雅絲來自美國並非事實。我與美國沒有任何關係，跟 50 州都沒有，真的。", "en": "\"I'm a local. I'm multi-local.\" See, \"Taiye Selasi comesfrom the United States,\" isn't the truth. I have no relationshipwith the United States, all 50 of them, not really."}, {"zh-tw": "我只與布魯克林有關係，因為那是我成長的地方；與紐約市有關，那是我開始工作的地方；與羅倫斯威爾有關，那是我度過感恩節的地方。讓我覺得美國是家鄉的原因不是我的護照或口音，而是這些非常特別的經驗，及這些經驗發生的地方。", "en": "My relationship is with Brookline,the town where I grew up; with New York City, where I started work; with Lawrenceville,where I spend Thanksgiving. What makes America home for meis not my passport or accent, but these very particular experiences and the places they occur."}, {"zh-tw": "儘管我對迦納的埃維文化，國家足球隊「黑星」引以為傲，也非常愛迦納食物，我與迦納共和國沒有任何關聯，非常明顯。我只與阿克拉有關聯，因為那是我母親住的地方，我每年都會去，與佐烏魯區一座小花園有關，我父親與我會在裡面聊上幾小時。", "en": "Despite my pride in Ewe culture, the Black Stars,and my love of Ghanaian food, I've never had a relationshipwith the Republic of Ghana, writ large. My relationship is with Accra,where my mother lives, where I go each year, with the little garden in Dzorwuluwhere my father and I talk for hours."}, {"zh-tw": "這些都是塑造我經歷的地方。我的經歷就是我「來自」的地方。", "en": "These are the placesthat shape my experience. My experience is where I'm from."}, {"zh-tw": "與其問「你從哪裡來？」如果我們這麼問：「你是哪個地方人」會如何？這會讓我們更加了解我們是誰，我們有多類似。你說你從法國來，我會看到什麼？陳腔濫調？阿迪奇的單一故事的危險性，對法國的迷思？你說你是（摩洛哥的）費茲及巴黎人，或這樣說更好，你是巴黎古得多區的人，我看到的就是生活經歷。", "en": "What if we asked, insteadof \"Where are you from?\" -- \"Where are you a local?\" This would tell us so much moreabout who and how similar we are. Tell me you're from France,and I see what, a set of clichés? Adichie's dangerous single story,the myth of the nation of France? Tell me you're a local of Fez and Paris, better yet, Goutte d'Or, and I seea set of experiences."}, {"zh-tw": "我們的經驗就是我們「來自」的地方。所以，你是哪個地方的人？我提議來一個三步驟測驗。", "en": "Our experience is where we're from. So, where are you a local? I propose a three-step test."}, {"zh-tw": "我稱這些為三「R」：習慣 (rituals)、關係 (relationships) 、限制 (restrictions)。首先，想一下你的日常生活習慣，不管是甚麼都沒關係：煮咖啡、開車上班、收割莊稼、禱告。", "en": "I call these the three \"R’s\":rituals, relationships, restrictions. First, think of your daily rituals,whatever they may be: making your coffee, driving to work, harvesting your crops,saying your prayers."}, {"zh-tw": "這些是什麼樣的生活習慣？在哪裡發生？這世界上有哪個城市或哪幾個城市有店家認識你？我小時候在波士頓過著還算標準的郊區生活習慣，還參雜了我母親從倫敦及拉哥斯帶來的習慣。我們在室內脫鞋，我們對長輩總是很有禮貌，我們吃辣的燉菜。", "en": "What kind of rituals are these? Where do they occur? In what city or cities in the worlddo shopkeepers know your face? As a child, I carried out fairly standardsuburban rituals in Boston, with adjustments made for the ritualsmy mother brought from London and Lagos. We took off our shoes in the house, we were unfailinglypolite with our elders, we ate slow-cooked, spicy food."}, {"zh-tw": "在下雪的北美，我們帶著南半球的習慣。我第一次去德里及義大利南方時，我被家的感覺嚇到。", "en": "In snowy North America,ours were rituals of the global South. The first time I went to Delhior to southern parts of Italy, I was shocked by how at home I felt."}, {"zh-tw": "很熟悉的生活習慣。第一個「R」，習慣。", "en": "The rituals were familiar. \"R\" number one, rituals."}, {"zh-tw": "現在，想想你的關係，想想跟你的生活大有關係的人。你跟誰每個星期至少講一次話，無論是面對面或是視訊？評估時要合理；我不是在說你的臉書朋友。", "en": "Now, think of your relationships,of the people who shape your days. To whom do you speak at least once a week, be it face to face or on FaceTime? Be reasonable in your assessment; I'm not talking aboutyour Facebook friends."}, {"zh-tw": "我是在說每星期會影響你情緒的人。我在阿克拉的母親，在波士頓的孿生妹妹，我在紐約的幾個要好朋友：這些關係對我就像家的感覺。", "en": "I'm speaking of the people who shapeyour weekly emotional experience. My mother in Accra,my twin sister in Boston, my best friends in New York: these relationships are home for me."}, {"zh-tw": "第二個「R」，關係。我們在哪裡帶著習慣過日子、產生關係，我們就是那裡人，但是我們對某地的經驗也部分受我們的限制所影響。", "en": "\"R\" number two, relationships. We're local where we carry outour rituals and relationships, but how we experience our locality depends in part on our restrictions."}, {"zh-tw": "我所謂的限制，是指你能住在哪裡？你有哪國的護照？你是否受像種族主義的限制，所以住的地方沒有太像家的感覺？是否受內戰、政局失衡、經濟通脹限制，所以你不能住在小時候培養出習慣的地方？這是三「R」中最不迷人的一個，比習慣與關係更難娓娓道出，但是這個問題能帶我們超越「你現在住在哪」，到「你現在為什麼不住在那裡？為什麼？」習慣、關係、限制。拿一張紙，把這三個詞寫在三欄的最上面，然後盡可能誠實填滿這三欄。", "en": "By restrictions, I mean,where are you able to live? What passport do you hold? Are you restricted by, say, racism,from feeling fully at home where you live? By civil war, dysfunctional governance,economic inflation, from living in the localitywhere you had your rituals as a child? This is the least sexy of the R’s, less lyric than rituals and relationships, but the question takes us past\"Where are you now?\" to \"Why aren't you there, and why?\" Rituals, relationships, restrictions. Take a piece of paper and put those three wordson top of three columns, then try to fill those columnsas honestly as you can."}, {"zh-tw": "一個全然不同的你，你在某地生活的樣子，你以經歷界定出的身分，可能因此出現。所以來試一下吧！", "en": "A very different pictureof your life in local context, of your identity as a set of experiences, may emerge. So let's try it."}, {"zh-tw": "我有個朋友叫歐路。他 35 歲。", "en": "I have a friend named Olu. He's 35 years old."}, {"zh-tw": "他的父母在奈及利亞出生，用獎學金到德國。歐路出生於紐倫堡，十歲前都住在那裡。", "en": "His parents, born in Nigeria,came to Germany on scholarships. Olu was born in Nurembergand lived there until age 10."}, {"zh-tw": "他家搬到拉哥斯時，他在倫敦讀書，然後去了柏林。他很愛去奈及利亞──因為天氣、食物、朋友──但是他討厭當地的政治腐敗。", "en": "When his family moved to Lagos,he studied in London, then came to Berlin. He loves going to Nigeria -- the weather, the food, the friends -- but hates the political corruption there."}, {"zh-tw": "所以歐路是哪裡人？我還有另一位朋友叫烏都。他也是 35 歲。", "en": "Where is Olu from? I have another friend named Udo. He's also 35 years old."}, {"zh-tw": "烏都生在阿根廷西北方的科爾多瓦，他的祖父母在戰後從德國──現稱波蘭──遷移到那裡。烏都在布宜諾斯艾利斯讀書，九前年到了柏林。", "en": "Udo was born in Córdoba,in northwest Argentina, where his grandparents migratedfrom Germany, what is now Poland, after the war. Udo studied in Buenos Aires,and nine years ago came to Berlin."}, {"zh-tw": "他很愛去阿根廷，因為天氣、食物及朋友，但他討厭那裡的經濟腐敗。所以烏都是哪裡人？因為他金髮碧眼，你大概會說烏都是德國人，但是他卻拿阿根廷護照，所以需要簽證才能住在柏林。", "en": "He loves going to Argentina -- the weather, the food, the friends -- but hates the economic corruption there. Where is Udo from? With his blonde hair and blue eyes,Udo could pass for German, but holds an Argentinian passport,so needs a visa to live in Berlin."}, {"zh-tw": "那位從阿根廷來的烏都與歷史大有關係。說他是布宜諾斯艾利斯及柏林人卻跟他的生活有關。", "en": "That Udo is from Argentinahas largely to do with history. That he's a localof Buenos Aires and Berlin, that has to do with life."}, {"zh-tw": "歐路看起來像奈及利亞人，卻需要簽證才能去奈及利亞。他說的非洲優魯巴話帶著英國腔，而他說的英文卻帶著德國腔。", "en": "Olu, who looks Nigerian,needs a visa to visit Nigeria. He speaks Yoruba with an English accent, and English with a German one."}, {"zh-tw": "但是如果你說他不是「真」奈及利亞人，又否定了他在拉哥斯的經歷，否定了他成長過程的生活習慣，否定了他與家人朋友的關係。同時，雖然拉哥斯無疑是他的家園之一，歐魯在那裡總是覺得大受限制，尤其他是同性戀這個事實。", "en": "To claim that he's\"not really Nigerian,\" though, denies his experience in Lagos, the rituals he practiced growing up, his relationship with family and friends. Meanwhile, though Lagosis undoubtedly one of his homes, Olu always feels restricted there, not least by the fact that he's gay."}, {"zh-tw": "他和烏都兩個人都受到雙親國家的政局腐敗限制，無法住在他們培養出最有意義的習慣及關係的地方。說歐魯是奈及利亞人，烏都是阿根廷人，轉移了我們對他們共同經歷的注意力。", "en": "Both he and Udo are restrictedby the political conditions of their parents' countries, from living where some of theirmost meaningful rituals and relationships occur. To say Olu is from Nigeriaand Udo is from Argentina distracts from their common experience."}, {"zh-tw": "他們的習慣、他們的關係及他們的限制都一樣。當然，我們問「你從哪裡來」時，我們好像在用速記法。", "en": "Their rituals, their relationships,and their restrictions are the same. Of course, when we ask,\"Where are you from?\" we're using a kind of shorthand."}, {"zh-tw": "說「奈及利亞」比說「拉哥斯及柏林」要快的多，而且因為 Google 地圖，我們總是可以拉近放大來看，從國家拉近到城市再到鄰近地區。但那不是重點。", "en": "It's quicker to say \"Nigeria\"than \"Lagos and Berlin,\" and as with Google Maps,we can always zoom in closer, from country to city to neighborhood. But that's not quite the point."}, {"zh-tw": "「你是哪國人」與「你是哪個地方人」的差別並非答案有多明確具體；而是在於問題本身的意圖。將國家這種表達法以地方來取代，讓我們轉移焦點到現實生活發生的地方。", "en": "The difference between\"Where are you from?\" and \"Where are you a local?\" isn't the specificity of the answer; it's the intention of the question. Replacing the language of nationalitywith the language of locality asks us to shift our focusto where real life occurs."}, {"zh-tw": "即便是最能輝煌展現國家的地方，世界杯足球賽，參賽的國家球隊也是由從各地來的隊員組成。作為人類經驗的測定單位，國家沒甚麼大用處。", "en": "Even that most glorious expressionof countryhood, the World Cup, gives us national teams comprisedmostly of multilocal players. As a unit of measurementfor human experience, the country doesn't quite work."}, {"zh-tw": "那就是為什麼歐魯會說：「我是德國人，但是我的父母來自奈及利亞。」句子裡的「但是」反證了這種單位的不靈活，固定、虛構的實體彼此衝突碰撞。「我是拉哥斯及柏林人，」告訴我們重疊的經歷，層層交織，無法被否認或抹去。", "en": "That's why Olu says, \"I'm German,but my parents come from Nigeria.\" The \"but\" in that sentencebelies the inflexibility of the units, one fixed and fictional entitybumping up against another. \"I'm a local of Lagos and Berlin,\"suggests overlapping experiences, layers that merge together,that can't be denied or removed."}, {"zh-tw": "你能拿走我的護照，但你拿不走我的經歷。它與我密不可分。", "en": "You can take away my passport, but you can't take away my experience.
