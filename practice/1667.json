Look at how the world looked in the 1960s, in terms of the proportion of people who had completed high school.", "en": " 我想告訴你有關國際學生能力評量計劃 (PISA) 的故事 它是經濟合作發展組織 (OECD) 的一項測驗 衡量全球 15 歲學生的知識及技能 而它確實說明了這種國際層次的比較 得以讓我們平日當做國家內政的 教育領域進一步全球化 讓我們來看看 1960 年代 世界各國的人口 完成高中教育的比例"}, {"zh-tw": " You can see the United States ahead of everyone else, and much of the economic success of the United States draws on its long-standing advantage as the first mover in education. But in the 1970s, some countries caught up.", "en": " 你可以看到美國傲視群雄 而許多美國的經濟成就 歸功於這種長久以來 作為教育先驅者的優勢 但在 1970 年代，一些國家急起直追"}, {"zh-tw": " In the 1980s, the global expansion of the talent pool continued. And the world didn't stop in the 1990s.", "en": " 到了 1980 年代 全球的人才數量持續成長 1990 年代也毫不減勢"}, {"zh-tw": " So in the '60s, the U.S. was first. In the '90s, it was 13th, and not because standards had fallen, but because they had risen so much faster elsewhere.", "en": " 所以美國在 60 年代是第 1 名 到了 90 年代變成第 13 名 這並不是因為美國的水準下降了 而是因為其他國家迅速地追上"}, {"zh-tw": " Korea shows you what's possible in education.

Look at the toxic mix of unemployed graduates on our streets, while employers say they cannot find the people with the skills they need.", "en": " 問題是 衡量學生在校的時間 或他們獲得的學位 並非總是判斷他們實力的好方法 看看街上那麼多找不到工作的畢業生 而雇主們卻在抱怨 找不到擁有合適技能的人才"}, {"zh-tw": " And that tells you that better degrees don't automatically translate into better skills and better jobs and better lives. So with PISA, we try to change this by measuring the knowledge and skills of people directly.", "en": " 這就說明了更高的學歷無法自動轉化為 更好的技能、更好的工作以及更好的生活 有了 PISA，我們試著去改變這樣的情況 讓學生的知識和技能 以直接的方式來衡量"}, {"zh-tw": " And we took a very special angle to this. We were less interested in whether students can simply reproduce what they have learned in school, but we wanted to test whether they can extrapolate from what they know and apply their knowledge in novel situations.", "en": " 我們採用一個非常特別的觀點 我們比較不在意 學生是否能複製在校所學 我們比較想評比的是 他們能否從所學中舉一反三 以及在新環境中運用他們的知識"}, {"zh-tw": " Now, some people have criticized us for this. They say, you know, such a way of measuring outcomes is terribly unfair to people, because we test students with problems they haven't seen before.", "en": " 有些人批評這樣的方法 他們說這種衡量結果的方式 對學生極為不公平因為我們的測驗 是他們從未見過的問題"}, {"zh-tw": " But if you take that logic, you know, you should consider life unfair, because the test of truth in life is not whether we can remember what we learned in school, but whether we are prepared for change, whether we are prepared for jobs that haven't been created, to use technologies that haven't been invented, to solve problems we just can't anticipate today. And once hotly contested, our way of measuring outcomes has actually quickly become the standard.", "en": " 但是如果你認同那樣的邏輯 你應該認為生活就是不公平的 因為生活中對真理的測驗並不在於 我們是否記得在學校學過什麼 而是在於我們是否為改變做好了準備 我們是否準備好去面對各種新工作 去運用尚未發明的科技 去解決今天無法預期的問題 經過激烈的爭論後 我們衡量結果的方法很快就成為了標準"}, {"zh-tw": " In our latest assessment in 2009, we measured 74 school systems that together cover 87 percent of the economy.

Or do we want to focus on equity and accept mediocrity? But actually, if you look at how countries come out on this picture, you see there are a lot of countries that actually are combining excellence with equity. In fact, one of the most important lessons from this comparison is that you don't have to compromise equity to achieve excellence.", "en": " 然後要討論的是（剩下的兩個象限）哪個比較好 是要屬於成績好 但社會差距大的象限？ 還是要注重平等但接受平庸？ 但實際上如果你去檢視圖上的各個國家 可以發現有很多國家 能夠兼顧優秀和公平 事實上，這個比較結果讓我們上了重要的一課 那就是無需犧牲公平 來達到優秀"}, {"zh-tw": " These countries have moved on from providing excellence for just some to providing excellence for all, a very important lesson.

If money would tell you everything about the quality of learning outcomes, you would find all the large bubbles at the top, no?

What you see is that two countries with similar spending achieve very different results.", "en": " 對每位學生的花費 只解釋了不到 20% 國家之間表現差異的原因 譬如，盧森堡是最昂貴的體系 但並非表現最好 你會發現花費相近的兩個國家 結果卻非常不同"}, {"zh-tw": " You also see -- and I think that's one of the most encouraging findings -- that we no longer live in a world that is neatly divided between rich and well-educated countries, and poor and badly-educated ones, a very, very important lesson. Let's look at this in greater detail.", "en": " 你也會看到──而我認為這是一個非常鼓舞人心的發現── 我們的世界已不再是涇渭分明 不再分成富裕且教育良好的國家 以及貧窮且教育糟糕的國家 這是非常非常重要的一課 讓我們更詳細地來看"}, {"zh-tw": " The red dot shows you spending per student relative to a country's wealth. One way you can spend money is by paying teachers well, and you can see Korea investing a lot in attracting the best people into the teaching profession.", "en": " 紅點表示 對每位學生的花費占一個國家財富的比例 投入金錢的方式之一是提高教師收入 你可以看到韓國大量地投入 來吸引最優秀的人才成為專業教師"}, {"zh-tw": " And Korea also invests into long school days, which drives up costs further. Last but not least, Koreans want their teachers not only to teach but also to develop.", "en": " 韓國也投入長時間的上課天數 進一步提高了成本 還有，韓國希望老師們 除了傳授知識，還要去培養及開發"}, {"zh-tw": " They invest in professional development and collaboration and many other things. All that costs money.", "en": " 他們投入專業的發展與合作專案 以及其他許多項目 這些都要花錢"}, {"zh-tw": " How can Korea afford all of this? The answer is, students in Korea learn in large classes. This is the blue bar which is driving costs down.", "en": " 韓國如何負擔這些？ 答案是大班教育 就是這條藍色的圓柱使得成本下降"}, {"zh-tw": " You go to the next country on the list, Luxembourg, and you can see the red dot is exactly where it is for Korea, so Luxembourg spends the same per student as Korea does. But, you know, parents and teachers and policymakers in Luxembourg all like small classes.", "en": " 再來看看旁邊的盧森堡 這個紅點與韓國在一模一樣的位置 這表示盧森堡在每位學生身上的花費與韓國相當 但盧森堡的家長、教師和政策制定者 都喜歡小班教學"}, {"zh-tw": " You know, it's very pleasant to walk into a small class. So they have invested all their money into there, and the blue bar, class size, is driving costs up.", "en": " 因為走進一個小班級的感覺很舒服 所以他們把錢都投入在那裡 藍色的這一條，也就是班級大小使得成本上升"}, {"zh-tw": " But even Luxembourg can spend its money only once, and the price for this is that teachers are not paid particularly well. Students don't have long hours of learning.", "en": " 但即使是盧森堡也無法將金錢重複使用 而代價就是 教師的收入沒有特別好 學生的上學時間不長"}, {"zh-tw": " And basically, teachers have little time to do anything else than teaching. So you can see two countries spent their money very differently, and actually how they spent their money matters a lot more than how much they invest in education.", "en": " 基本上，老師除了教書之外並沒有時間去做其他事情 所以你可以看到兩個國家花錢的方式非常不一樣 而實際上他們如何用錢 比用了多少錢對教育有更多的影響"}, {"zh-tw": " Let's go back to the year 2000. Remember, that was the year before the iPod was invented.", "en": " 讓我們回到 2000 年 記住，這一年 iPod 還沒有出現"}, {"zh-tw": " This is how the world looked then in terms of PISA performance. The first thing you can see is that the bubbles were a lot smaller, no? We spent a lot less on education, about 35 percent less on education.", "en": " 這是當時世界各國的樣子 以 PISA 測驗結果來看 首先，你會注意到所有的泡泡都小了許多，對吧？ 那時我們在教育上的花費少了許多 大約少了35%"}, {"zh-tw": " So you ask yourself, if education has become so much more expensive, has it become so much better? And the bitter truth really is that, you know, not in many countries. But there are some countries which have seen impressive improvements.", "en": " 我們自問：如果已經在教育上投入了這麼多的錢 它是不是也跟著改善了許多？ 但讓人難堪的事實是 沒有多少個國家真的如此 不過有一些國家 已經有了不起的進步"}, {"zh-tw": " Germany, my own country, in the year 2000, featured in the lower quadrant, below average performance, large social disparities.

People were stunned by the results.", "en": " 測驗結果讓人非常失望 人們感到震驚"}, {"zh-tw": " And for the very first time, the public debate in Germany was dominated for months by education, not tax, not other kinds of issues, but education was the center of the public debate. And then policymakers began to respond to this.", "en": " 史無前例地，德國的公眾辯論 圍繞教育話題進行了數月 不是稅收，不是其他問題，而是教育 成為了公眾議題的焦點 後來政策制定者開始做出應對"}, {"zh-tw": " The federal government dramatically raised its investment in education. A lot was done to increase the life chances of students with an immigrant background or from social disadvantage.", "en": " 聯邦政府大幅增加教育投資 努力提供更多機會 給來自移民家庭或社會弱勢群體的學生"}, {"zh-tw": " And what's really interesting is that this wasn't just about optimizing existing policies, but data transformed some of the beliefs and paradigms underlying German education. For example, traditionally, the education of the very young children was seen as the business of families, and you would have cases where women were seen as neglecting their family responsibilities when they sent their children to kindergarten.", "en": " 有趣的是，這不僅是 使現有的體制更完善 同時也轉變了一些信念及範例 那原本是德國教育的基礎 譬如，幼兒教育在傳統上 被認為是家庭的職責而且你能看到在許多例子中 當婦女把孩子送到幼稚園 會被視為忽視家庭職責"}, {"zh-tw": " PISA has transformed that debate, and pushed early childhood education right at the center of public policy in Germany. Or traditionally, the German education divides children at the age of 10, very young children, between those deemed to pursue careers of knowledge workers and those who would end up working for the knowledge workers, and that mainly along socioeconomic lines, and that paradigm is being challenged now too.", "en": " PISA 轉變了這個爭論 並且促使幼兒早期教育成為 德國公眾政策的核心 還有，傳統上德國的教育 把 10 歲的小孩，很小的年紀 區分為將來會成為知識工作者的人 以及將來為知識工作者工作的人 這樣的區分主要是依循社會經濟的路線 而這種典範現在也遇到了挑戰"}, {"zh-tw": " A lot of change. And the good news is, nine years later, you can see improvements in quality and equity.", "en": " 發生了許多改變 好消息是，九年之後 你們可以看到品質和公平都有所改善"}, {"zh-tw": " People have taken up the challenge, done something about it. Or take Korea, at the other end of the spectrum.", "en": " 人們接受了挑戰並採取行動 再來看看屬於最高象限的韓國"}, {"zh-tw": " In the year 2000, Korea did already very well, but the Koreans were concerned that only a small share of their students achieved the really high levels of excellence. They took up the challenge, and Korea was able to double the proportion of students achieving excellence in one decade in the field of reading.", "en": " 在 2000 年，韓國已經有很好的表現 但韓國人擔心，只有小部分的學生 達到非常優異的成績 他們接受了挑戰 並在十年內讓閱讀表現優秀的學生 比例增加了一倍"}, {"zh-tw": " Well, if you only focus on your brightest students, you know what happens is disparities grow, and you can see this bubble moving slightly to the other direction, but still, an impressive improvement. A major overhaul of Poland's education helped to dramatically reduce between variability among schools, turn around many of the lowest-performing schools, and raise performance by over half a school year.", "en": " 如果你只集中於培養最聰明的學生 你知道這會造成社會差距擴大 你會看到泡泡稍微朝另一個方向移動 不過這仍是很好的改進 一項對波蘭教育的重大檢討 協助大幅降低了學校之間的差異 徹底改變了許多表現差的學校 成績提高超過半個學年"}, {"zh-tw": " And you can see other countries as well. Portugal was able to consolidate its fragmented school system, raise quality and improve equity, and so did Hungary.", "en": " 其他國家也是 葡萄牙得以整合七零八落的學校體制 提升品質並增進公平 匈牙利也是如此"}, {"zh-tw": " So what you can actually see, there's been a lot of change. And even those people who complain and say that the relative standing of countries on something like PISA is just an artifact of culture, of economic factors, of social issues, of homogeneity of societies, and so on, these people must now concede that education improvement is possible.", "en": " 所以確實可以看到很多的改變 甚至那些抱怨說 國家之間的排名高低 譬如 PISA 測驗結果不過是一種人工產物，來自於文化 經濟因素、社會問題 社會均一性等因素 這些人現在必須承認教育改革是可能的"}, {"zh-tw": " You know, Poland hasn't changed its culture. It didn't change its economy. It didn't change the compositions of its population.", "en": " 大家知道，波蘭並沒有改變它的文化 也沒有改變它的經濟 也沒有改變它的人口結構"}, {"zh-tw": " It didn't fire its teachers. It changed its education policies and practice. Very impressive. And all that raises, of course, the question: What can we learn from those countries in the green quadrant who have achieved high levels of equity, high levels of performance, and raised outcomes? And, of course, the question is, can what works in one context provide a model elsewhere? Of course, you can't copy and paste education systems wholesale, but these comparisons have identified a range of factors that high-performing systems share.", "en": " 他們沒有開除教師而是改變了教育政策 和教育實務，非常了不起 所有這些產生了一個問題： 我們能從綠色象限的國家中學到什麼？ 這些國家創造了高水準的平等 優秀的表現，並且提升了成果 當然，問題在於：在某個國家的成功經驗 能否複製於另一個國家？ 當然的，你不能複製整個教育體系 但這些比較結果辨識出了一些要素 是表現優異的體系共同擁有的"}, {"zh-tw": " Everybody agrees that education is important. Everybody says that.", "en": " 每個人都認同教育是重要的 每個人都這麼說"}, {"zh-tw": " But the test of truth is, how do you weigh that priority against other priorities? How do countries pay their teachers relative to other highly skilled workers? Would you want your child to become a teacher rather than a lawyer? How do the media talk about schools and teachers? Those are the critical questions, and what we have learned from PISA is that, in high-performing education systems, the leaders have convinced their citizens to make choices that value education, their future, more than consumption today. And you know what's interesting? You won't believe it, but there are countries in which the most attractive place to be is not the shopping center but the school.", "en": " 但事實上這個評量顯示出：如何去衡量教育和其他事務 的先後順序？ 國家付給老師的薪水 如何和其他高技術勞工比較？ 父母希望孩子當老師 還是做律師？ 媒體上是怎麼談論學校和教師的？ 這些都是至關重要的問題 而我們從 PISA 學到在高績效的教育體系中 領導者讓市民相信並選擇 要重視教育、重視未來 更甚於今天的消費 有趣的是，你可能不會相信 有些國家最吸引人的地方 並不是購物中心，而是學校"}, {"zh-tw": " Those things really exist. But placing a high value on education is just part of the picture.", "en": " 這樣的事情真的存在 但只重視教育 還不夠"}, {"zh-tw": " The other part is the belief that all children are capable of success.
