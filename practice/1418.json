We all want to bringevery good thing to our children.", "en": " 這是普世皆然的想法。 我們都想給孩子最好的一切。"}, {"zh-tw": " But what's not universal is our abilityto provide every good thing. So many women sufferfrom domestic violence.", "en": " 但是怎麼給他們最好的卻非普世皆然。 許多婦女遭受家暴。"}, {"zh-tw": " And they can't evenbroach the subject of contraception, even inside their own marriage. There are many womenwho lack basic education.", "en": " 她們甚至無法提出避孕的話題， 即使已經結婚了也不行。 很多女性沒有受過基本教育。"}, {"zh-tw": " Even many of the womenwho do have knowledge and do have power don't have access to contraceptives.

This is a very powerful idea.", "en": " 小家庭趨勢能廣傳的原因， 是整件事受這個想法驅使， 就是夫婦能實行節育， 自行決定他們要有多少孩子。 這是很有影響力的想法。"}, {"zh-tw": " It means that parents havethe ability to affect the future, not just accept it as it is. In France, the average family sizewent down every decade for 150 years in a rowuntil it stabilized.", "en": " 這意味著父母能影響未來， 而非被動的接受。 在法國，平均家庭人口數每十年就縮小一次， 持續了 150 年，直到穩定為止。"}, {"zh-tw": " It took so long back then becausethe contraceptives weren't that good. In Germany, this transition startedin the 1880s, and it took just 50 years for family sizeto stabilize in this country.", "en": " 要花這麼長的時間是因為過去的避孕效果不太好。 德國於 1880 年代開始轉變，然後只花了 50 年 就使這個國家的家庭人數達到穩定。"}, {"zh-tw": " And in Asia and Latin America,the transition started in the 1960s, and it happened much fasterbecause of modern contraception.

For instance, in the 1960s, Indiaadopted very specific numeric targets and they paid women to accepthaving an IUD placed in their bodies.", "en": " 這是因為某些家庭計畫 使出不適宜的誘因和高壓政策。 例如在 1960 年代，印度採用非常具體的數字目標， 而且他們還付錢給女性，讓她們在體內裝上子宮環。"}, {"zh-tw": " Now, Indian women werereally smart in this situation. When they went to get an IUD inserted,they got paid six rupees.", "en": " 印度女性在這方面真的很精明。 她們每次去裝子宮環，就會得到六盧比。"}, {"zh-tw": " And so what did they do? They waited a few hours or a few days, and they went to another service providerand had the IUD removed for one rupee. For decades in the United States, African-American womenwere sterilized without their consent.", "en": " 所以她們怎麼做呢？ 她們會等幾小時或幾天， 然後去另一家醫院付一盧比取出子宮環。 美國曾有數十年的歷史， 非裔女性未經同意就被強迫絕育。"}, {"zh-tw": " The procedure was so common it became known asthe Mississippi appendectomy -- a tragic chapter in my country's history.

They were carried out in places where parents alreadywanted to lower their family size.", "en": " 這樣的事件最令人驚訝的， 是這些高壓政策其實是不必要的。 實施這些政策的地方， 那裡的父母老早就想減少家庭人數。"}, {"zh-tw": " Because in region after region,again and again, parents have wantedto have smaller families. There's no reason to believe that African womenhave innately different desires.", "en": " 因為我們在世界各地，一次又一次地看見， 父母都想要小一點的家庭。 沒有理由相信 非洲婦女有天生不同的要求。"}, {"zh-tw": " Given the option,they will have fewer children. The question is: will we invest in helpingall women get what they want now?
