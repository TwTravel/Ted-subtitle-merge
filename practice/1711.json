And I'm sitting in a waiting room some time later for an ultrasound, and all six of these doctors actually show up in the room at once, and I'm like, \"Uh oh, this is bad news.\" And their diagnosis was this: They said, \"You have two rare kidney diseases that are going to actually destroy your kidneys eventually, you have cancer-like cells in your immune system that we need to start treatment right away, and you'll never be eligible for a kidney transplant, and you're not likely to live more than two or three years.\" Now, with the gravity of this doomsday diagnosis, it just sucked me in immediately, as if I began preparing myself as a patient to die according to the schedule that they had just given to me, until I met a patient named Verna in a waiting room, who became a dear friend, and she grabbed me one day and took me off to the medical library and did a bunch of research on these diagnoses and these diseases, and said, \"Eric, these people who get this are normally in their '70s and '80s.", "en": " 我被送到學生健康中心 做了一些檢驗後，立刻得知 是腎臟問題 我還沒搞清楚狀況，就開始了 六個月的檢驗、考驗和折磨 由2家醫院的6位醫生診治 這些醫界權威互相爭執 想釐清誰才正確 診斷出我的病情 做完超音波後，我坐在候診室 6位醫生同時出現 我想：「糟了，一定是壞消息！」 醫生診斷說： 「你得了兩種罕見的腎臟疾病， 最終會讓你的腎臟壞死， 你的免疫系統中有類似癌症細胞， 必須立即治療。 你永遠不可能符合換腎資格， 最多還能活2到3年。」 這項診斷好像世界末日 讓我立刻認定 自己就是病人 將在醫生宣判的日期死亡 我在候診室遇到另一位病人薇娜(Verna) 她成了我的好友，有天她拉著我 帶我到醫學圖書館 仔細研究我的疾病和診斷 然後說：「得到這些疾病的人， 通常都是七、八十歲，"}, {"zh-tw": " They don't know anything about you.

Think about a coach, an agent online, that's going to help me do safe self-care. That same interaction that we just did with the ultrasound will likely have real-time image processing, and the device will say, \"Up, down, left, right, ah, Eric, that's the perfect spot to send that image off to your doctor.\" Now, if we've got all these networked devices that are helping us to do care anywhere, it stands to reason that we also need a team to be able to interact with all of that stuff, and that leads to the second pillar I want to talk about, care networking.", "en": " 軟體越來越聰明，對吧？ 就像是線上的教練或經紀人 可幫我們安全的自我照顧 像我剛才展示超音波的互動 未來可能會有即時影像處理 機器會指揮我上下左右 說：「就是這個位置，影像存檔， 傳給你的醫生吧！」 如果我們有了這些網路裝置 照護行動化就可以達成 當然，我們需要一個團隊 來進行相關互動 這就需要我說的第二根支柱 照護網路化"}, {"zh-tw": " We have got to go beyond this paradigm of isolated specialists doing parts care to multidisciplinary teams doing person care. Uncoordinated care today is expensive at best, and it is deadly at worst.", "en": " 我們要突破傳統模式 也就是獨立專科醫師分別進行部分照護 進而由多科別團隊進行個人化照護 今日缺乏協調的照護，不僅昂貴 還可能致命"}, {"zh-tw": " Eighty percent of medical errors are actually caused by communication and coordination problems amongst medical team members.

The technologies that are coming, high-performance computing, analytics, big data that everyone's talking about, will allow us to build predictive models for each of us as individual patients.", "en": " 這些全民研究幫忙創造了 許多新藥，救治了數百萬的生命 問題是，這種醫療照護 把我們當成平均數而不是獨立的個人 終究來說 病人和研究的平均數並不相同 所以必須要用猜的 新科技已經來臨 電腦的高速運算、分析 大家都在講的大資料運算(big data) 可針對每個人建立預測模型 把每個人當作個別病人"}, {"zh-tw": " And the magic here is, experiment on my avatar in software, not my body in suffering.

And I tell you, this kind of care customization for everything from your goals to your genetics will be the most game-changing transformation that we witness in health care during our lifetime.", "en": " 最後他們說：「成功了， 醫界權威爭執多年的診斷 全都錯了， 現在有更好的方向可以邁進。」 英特爾正努力，希望能找出方法 讓個人化醫療的運算 由幾個月縮短到幾週，甚至幾小時 讓更多人可使用 不僅限於全球一流的教學醫院 而能成為主流－讓每個病人、每間診所都可使用 這種完整的基因體定序 這種照護客製化 從個人目標到基因體定序 將是改變遊戲規則的大革命 我們有生之年就可見證到"}, {"zh-tw": " So these three pillars of personal health, care anywhere, care networking, care customization, are happening in pieces now, but this vision will completely fail if we don't step up as caregivers and as patients to take on new roles.
