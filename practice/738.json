The reality, now here is something important.", "en": " 我推薦房屋 事實是 接下來有真正重要的要出現了"}, {"zh-tw": " What's important about this is these shapes are duals of each other.

October 9th, in France, Jean-Pierre Luminet said that the universe is probably shaped like a dodecahedron, based on information that they got from this probe.

And judging from this, it looks a little like a cheeseburger.", "en": " 所以你可以稍微了解到 從這個非常龐大的背景之中 所以我們可以開始了解到這個主要的宇宙長的會像是什麼樣子 從這張圖來看 他看起來有點像是起斯漢堡"}, {"zh-tw": " So, I'm thinking the universe is either a dodecahedron or a cheeseburger.
