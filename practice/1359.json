And I really thinkthat the most important thing of it is that we stopped listening to patients. And one thing we did at Radboud University is we appointed a Chief Listening Officer.", "en": " 我要跟你們說 為什麼很多線上健康企劃會失敗。 我真的認為最主要的原因是 我們不再聽病人說什麼。 我們在荷蘭奈美恩大學做了一件事， 我們指定一個主要的傾聽人員。"}, {"zh-tw": " Not in a very scientific way -- she puts up a little cupof coffee or a cup of tea and asks patients, family, relatives, \"What's up? How could we help you?\" And we think, we like to think, that this is one of the major problems why all -- maybe not all -- but most of the ehealth projects fail, since we stopped listening. This is my weight scale.", "en": " 這不是非常科學的方法 -- 她倒了一些咖啡或茶， 問病人或者他的家人和親戚們： 「最近好嗎？ 我們可以給你什麼協助？」 我們的想法是， 幾乎全部 -- 可能不是全部 -- 但大部分線上健康企劃 失敗的主要原因之一 是我們不再傾聽。 這是我的可無線上網體重機，非常簡單的東西。"}, {"zh-tw": " It's a very simple thing.It's got one knob, on/off. And every morning I hop on it.", "en": " 上面有一個按鈕，開和關。 每天早上我站到上面。"}, {"zh-tw": " And yes, I've got a challenge, as you might see. And I put my challenge on 95 kg.", "en": " 是的，我有一個挑戰， 如你所見。 我要挑戰減重到95公斤。"}, {"zh-tw": " But the thing is thatit's made this simple that whenever I hop on, it sends my data to Google Health as well. And it's collectedby my general practitioner as well, so he can see what's my problem in weight, not on the very momentthat I need cardiologic support or something like it, but also looking backward.", "en": " 這台體重機讓事情變得很簡單， 當我隨時站上去， 它也會將我的資料傳輸到Google Healthe(開放性醫療管理平台)。 我的醫師也會收到這些資料， 所以他可以觀察我的體重問題， 而不是等到 我有心臟病時需要接受幫助之類的時候， 還有他也可以查詢歷史紀錄。"}, {"zh-tw": " But there's another thing. As some of you might know, I've got more than 4000followers on Twitter.", "en": " 還有一件事。 你們當中可能有人知道，我在推特上有超過4000名跟隨者。"}, {"zh-tw": " So every morning, I hop on my weight scale and before I'm in my car, people start talking to me, \"I think you needa light lunch today, Lucien.\" But that's the nicest thingthat could happen, since this is peer pressure. Peer pressure used to help patients -- since this could be used for obesity, it could be usedto stop patients from smoking.", "en": " 於是每天早上 我站上我的可無線上網的體重機， 當我進入我的車前，人們開始跟我說： 「我想你今天午餐要吃少一點，Lucien。」 但是往好處想， 這是同儕壓力， 同儕壓力可幫助病人 -- 像是有肥胖問題， 或者是要 戒菸的病人。"}, {"zh-tw": " But on the other hand, it also could be usedto get people out of their chairs and try to work togetherin some kind of gaming activity to get more control of their health. As of next week,it will soon be available, there will be this littleblood-pressure meter connected to an iPhoneor something or other.", "en": " 此外，這也可以用來 讓人們離開座位 且試著一起參予些有比賽性質的活動 來控制他們的健康。 下周即將上市的 是這個小的血壓計， 可以連接到iPhone或者其它設備，"}, {"zh-tw": " And people will be able, from their homes, to take their blood pressure, send it to their doctor and eventually share itwith others, for instance, for over a 100 dollars. And this is the pointwhere patients get into position and can collect,not only their own control again, be captain of their own ship, but also can help us in health care due to the challenges that we face, like health-care cost explosion, doubled demand and things like that, make techniques that are easy to use and start with thisto embrace patients in the team.", "en": " 所以人們將能夠在家裡 測量血壓， 將數值傳給他們的醫生， 最後和其他人分享， 費用大約是100歐元出頭。 這樣一來，病人可以搜集自己的資料， 他們不僅再度擁有控制權， 當自己的掌舵者， 這也對保健事業有所幫助， 考慮到我們現在所面臨的挑戰， 像是保健成本劇增， 需求倍增等情況， 製作容易使用的技術， 開始將病患納入這團隊中。"}, {"zh-tw": " And you can do thiswith techniques like this, but also by crowdsourcing. And one of the things we did, that I would like to share with youintroduced by a little video.", "en": " 你可以透過像是這種技術參與其中， 也可以透過群眾外包的力量。 我想要藉由一小段影片 介紹我們做的一件事。"}, {"zh-tw": " (Music) (Heart-beat) We've all gotnavigation controls in our car. We maybe even have it in our cellphone.", "en": " (音樂) 我們在車內都有安裝導航系統。 甚至也有裝在手機裡。"}, {"zh-tw": " We perfectly know where all the ATMs are, just about the city of Maastricht. The other thing is we knowwhere all the gas stations are.", "en": " 我們知道在馬斯垂克市裡 所有的自動提款機在哪裡。 我們也知道所有的加油站在哪。"}, {"zh-tw": " And sure, we could find fast food chains.

So what we did,we crowdsourced the Netherlands.", "en": " 沒人知道現在可以在附近哪裡取得 可救命的電擊器。 我們做的是在荷蘭進行群眾外包。 我們架設一個網站"}, {"zh-tw": " We set up a website, and asked the crowd, \"If you see an AED, please submit it, tell us where it is,tell us when it's open,\" since sometimes in office hoursit's closed, of course. And over 10,000 AEDs in the Netherlands already have been submitted.", "en": " 請求大家，「如果你看到一個電擊器， 請傳送此資訊，告訴我們它在哪哩， 告訴我們店什麼時候開。」 因為店家有營業和休息的時間。 群眾已經傳送超過一萬個 在荷蘭的電擊器資訊。"}, {"zh-tw": " The next step we tookwas to find the applications for it. And we built an iPad application.", "en": " 我們接著要找到搭配的應用程式， 於是我們製作了一個iPad應用程式。"}, {"zh-tw": " We made an applicationfor Layar: Augmented Reality, to find these AEDs. And whenever you arein a city like Maastricht, and somebody collapses,you can use your iPhone, and within the next weeksalso your Microsoft cellphone, to find the nearest AED, which can save lives.", "en": " 我們為Layar製作一個擴增實境定位的應用程式， 以找到這些電擊器。 於是當你在像馬斯垂克這樣一個城市中的任何地方，有人倒下了， 你可以使用你的iPhone， 還有再過幾個星期，你也可以用你的微軟手機， 找到最近的電擊器 以搶救生命。"}, {"zh-tw": " And as of today, we would like to introduce this,not only as AED4EU, which is what the product is called, but also AED4US.

The other thing we would like to ask is of companies also all over the world that will be able to help usvalidate these AEDs.", "en": " 我們請求散布在世界其它各地的同事們， 同類型大學來幫助我們， 蒐集，合作且做為 全世界各地進行群眾外包蒐集電擊器資訊的中心。 當你度假時，剛好有人倒下， 那人可能是你的親戚或者站在你前面的人， 你就可以找到這個。 另外我們想要請求 全世界可幫助我們 驗證這些電擊器資訊的公司，"}, {"zh-tw": " These might be courier services or cable guys, for instance, just to see whetherthe AED that is submitted is still in place.
