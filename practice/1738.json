It's not true. I've traveled the whole lengthand breadth of this country.", "en": " 我 12 年前來到這裡 剛到的時候，聽過各種說法 例如「美國人聽不懂諷刺」 你們聽說過這個說法嗎？ 但這不是真的，我旅行全美各地"}, {"zh-tw": " I have found no evidencethat Americans don't get irony. It's one of those cultural myths, like, \"The British are reserved.\" I don't know why people think this.", "en": " 完全不認為美國人聽不懂諷刺 這就是所謂的文化迷思 還有人說「英國人很保守」 我不知為何有人這麼想"}, {"zh-tw": " We've invaded every countrywe've encountered. But it's not true Americansdon't get irony, but I just want you to knowthat that's what people are saying about you behind your back.", "en": " 我們侵略每個遇到的國家 說美國人聽不懂諷刺，絕對是假的 我只想讓你們知道 別人在背後怎麼說你們"}, {"zh-tw": " You know, so when you leaveliving rooms in Europe, people say, thankfully,nobody was ironic in your presence. But I knew that Americans get irony when I came across that legislation,\"No Child Left Behind.\" Because whoever thoughtof that title gets irony.", "en": " 當美國人在歐洲起身離開客廳 大家會說，還好沒人當你的面諷刺 我知道美國人完全了解諷刺 就在我聽到「沒有孩子落後」時(有教無類法案 No Child Left Behind) 命名者一定了解什麼叫諷刺"}, {"zh-tw": " Don't they? Because it's leavingmillions of children behind. Now I can see that's not a very attractivename for legislation: \"Millions of Children Left Behind.\" I can see that.", "en": " 不是嗎，因為… 因為幾百萬孩子落後了 如果法案叫做「百萬孩子落後」 也不合適，這我明白"}, {"zh-tw": " What's the plan? We propose to leavemillions of children behind, and here's how it's going to work. And it's working beautifully.", "en": " 我們打算怎麼做呢？我們建議 讓百萬孩子落後 我們這麼做 而且成效顯著"}, {"zh-tw": " In some parts of the country, 60 percent of kids drop outof high school. In the Native American communities, it's 80 percent of kids.", "en": " 美國的某些地區 60% 的孩子從高中輟學 美國原住民社區 輟學率更高達 80%"}, {"zh-tw": " If we halved that number, one estimate is it would createa net gain to the U.S. economy over 10 years,of nearly a trillion dollars.

America spends more money on educationthan most other countries.", "en": " 根本原因 不是經費不足 美國花在教育的投資 比世界上大多數國家都多"}, {"zh-tw": " Class sizes are smallerthan in many countries. And there are hundredsof initiatives every year to try and improve education.", "en": " 班級人數也較少 每年有幾百件方案 嘗試改善教育"}, {"zh-tw": " The trouble is, it's all goingin the wrong direction.

One of the effectsof \"No Child Left Behind\" has been to narrow the focusonto the so-called STEM disciplines.", "en": " 學校只被要求 在狹窄範圍內探索學生潛力 「有教無類法案」的影響之一是 只重視數理主科 這些學科很重要"}, {"zh-tw": " They're very important. I'm not here to argueagainst science and math.", "en": " 我不是要說，科學及數學不重要"}, {"zh-tw": " On the contrary, they're necessarybut they're not sufficient. A real education has to give equal weight to the arts, the humanities,to physical education.", "en": " 它們很重要，只是還不夠 真正的教育應同樣重視 藝術、人文、體育"}, {"zh-tw": " An awful lot of kids, sorry, thank you -- One estimate in America currentlyis that something like 10 percent of kids, getting on that way, are being diagnosedwith various conditions under the broad titleof attention deficit disorder.

The second, thank you -- The second principlethat drives human life flourishing is curiosity.", "en": " 而在於可和孩子一些 本來碰觸不到的部分對話 第二項…謝謝… 要活得精彩，第二項法則是： 好奇心"}, {"zh-tw": " If you can light the sparkof curiosity in a child, they will learn without any furtherassistance, very often.

Curiosity is the engine of achievement.", "en": " 無論是激發或扼殺這項能力 都會產生巨大影響 好奇心是成就的火車頭"}, {"zh-tw": " Now the reason I say this is because one of the effectsof the current culture here, if I can say so, has been to de-professionalize teachers. There is no system in the worldor any school in the country that is better than its teachers.", "en": " 我會這麼說是因為 我大膽的說，當前文化的影響之一 是剝奪了教師的專業性 世界上沒有哪個教育體系的品質、 沒有哪個學校的品質， 能超過其教師的品質"}, {"zh-tw": " Teachers are the lifebloodof the success of schools. But teaching is a creative profession.", "en": " 教師是學校成功的關鍵 教書是需要創造力的職業"}, {"zh-tw": " Teaching, properly conceived,is not a delivery system.

But a wonderful guy he was,wonderful philosopher.", "en": " 人最老也不過如此 他是個了不起的人是個偉大的哲學家"}, {"zh-tw": " He used to talk about the difference between the taskand achievement senses of verbs. You can be engagedin the activity of something, but not really beachieving it, like dieting.", "en": " 他曾談到，「進行」一件事 和「完成」一件事，意義大不相同 你可以進行著某件事 但沒有成果 像節食就是個很好的例子"}, {"zh-tw": " It's a very good example. There he is. He's dieting. Is he losing any weight? Not really. Teaching is a word like that.", "en": " 他一直節食，體重有減輕嗎？沒有"}, {"zh-tw": " You can say, \"There's Deborah,she's in room 34, she's teaching.\" But if nobody's learning anything, she may be engaged in the task of teachingbut not actually fulfilling it. The role of a teacheris to facilitate learning.", "en": " 教學也是這樣 你可以說，「戴老師在教室教書」 但如果沒人學到東西 他就只是在「進行」教學 但沒有真正「完成」教學任務 教師的角色是促進學習，這是重點"}, {"zh-tw": " That's it. And part of the problem is, I think, that the dominant cultureof education has come to focus on not teaching and learning, but testing.", "en": " 我認為部分問題在於 教育的主流文化重視的 不是教與學，而是考試"}, {"zh-tw": " Now, testing is important. Standardized tests have a place.", "en": " 考試很重要的，標準化測驗有必要"}, {"zh-tw": " But they should not bethe dominant culture of education.

I do.", "en": " 如果我參加體檢 我當然也要做常規檢驗"}, {"zh-tw": " I want to knowwhat my cholesterol level is compared to everybody else'son a standard scale.

It shouldn't obstruct it,which of course it often does.", "en": " 「你的膽固醇指數為橘色。」 「是嗎？是好消息嗎？」「不知道。」 測驗應該是輔助、而非妨礙學習 可惜目前經常是妨礙"}, {"zh-tw": " So in place of curiosity,what we have is a culture of compliance. Our children and teachers are encouragedto follow routine algorithms rather than to excite that powerof imagination and curiosity.", "en": " 就好奇心而言 我們的教育文化要求服從 鼓勵孩子和老師 遵守固定規則 而不是激發想像力和好奇心"}, {"zh-tw": " And the third principle is this:that human life is inherently creative. It's why we all have different résumés.", "en": " 第三項法則是： 人生的本質就是創造性 我們的經歷各不相同"}, {"zh-tw": " We create our lives, and we can recreate themas we go through them. It's the common currencyof being a human being.", "en": " 我們創造自己的命運 我們經歷的同時，也在重新創造 這是人類的共同價值"}, {"zh-tw": " It's why human cultureis so interesting and diverse and dynamic. I mean, other animals may well haveimaginations and creativity, but it's not so muchin evidence, is it, as ours? I mean, you may have a dog.", "en": " 人類文化也因此多采多姿、 充滿活力 其他動物可能也有想像力 與創造力，但和人類相比 就沒那麼明顯 比方說你有隻狗"}, {"zh-tw": " And your dog may get depressed. You know, but it doesn't listento Radiohead, does it? And sit staring out the windowwith a bottle of Jack Daniels.", "en": " 得了憂鬱症 但牠不會因此開始聽電台司令的歌吧？(Radiohead 樂團) 牠不會喝傑克丹尼威士忌，對窗外發呆 (Jack Daniels)"}, {"zh-tw": " \"Would you like to come for a walk?\" \"No, I'm fine.\" \"You go. I'll wait. But take pictures.\" We all create our own livesthrough this restless process of imagining alternativesand possibilities, and one of the roles of education is to awaken and developthese powers of creativity. Instead, what we haveis a culture of standardization.", "en": " 你如果說，「想出去走走嗎？」 牠不會說，「不，我沒事， 去吧，我要靜一靜，記得拍點照片。」 我們經由不斷變化的過程創造人生 不斷想像有哪些選擇、哪些可能 教育目的之一 就是喚醒並發展創造力 但現在教育反而走向標準化"}, {"zh-tw": " Now, it doesn't have to be that way. It really doesn't.", "en": " 不該是這樣，真的不應該"}, {"zh-tw": " Finland regularly comes out on topin math, science and reading. Now, we only knowthat's what they do well at, because that's all that's being tested.", "en": " 芬蘭學生在全球名列前茅 不論數學、科學、或閱讀 我們只知道他們擅長這些科目 因為現在只考了這幾科"}, {"zh-tw": " That's one of the problems of the test. They don't look for other thingsthat matter just as much.", "en": " 這就是測驗的問題之一 你無法找出同樣重要的其他因素"}, {"zh-tw": " The thing about work in Finland is this: they don't obsess about those disciplines. They have a very broadapproach to education, which includes humanities,physical education, the arts.", "en": " 芬蘭所作的努力是這樣的： 他們不只重視這幾科 他們的教育範圍很廣 包括人文、體育、藝術"}, {"zh-tw": " Second, there is no standardizedtesting in Finland. I mean, there's a bit, but it's not what getspeople up in the morning, what keeps them at their desks.", "en": " 其次，芬蘭沒有標準化考試 當然有些考試 但用意不是要學生早起晨讀 不是要把學生綁在書桌前"}, {"zh-tw": " The third thing --and I was at a meeting recently with some people from Finland,actual Finnish people, and somebody from the American systemwas saying to the people in Finland, \"What do you doabout the drop-out rate in Finland?\" And they all looked a bitbemused, and said, \"Well, we don't have one. Why would you drop out? If people are in trouble,we get to them quite quickly and we help and support them.\" Now people always say, \"Well, you know, you can't compareFinland to America.\" No. I think there's a populationof around five million in Finland.", "en": " 第三，最近我參加了一個會議 有邀請芬蘭人、真正芬蘭來的人 有位美國教育體系的人 問芬蘭人： 「芬蘭的輟學率多高？」 芬蘭人呆住了，說： 「我們一個輟學生都沒有。 為什麼要輟學呢？ 學生有困難，我們很快會發現， 並幫助他們、支持他們。」 有人會說： 「不能拿芬蘭和美國比。」 不，芬蘭人口 大約只有 500 萬"}, {"zh-tw": " But you can compare itto a state in America. Many states in Americahave fewer people in them than that.", "en": " 但你可拿芬蘭和美國一州相比 美國許多州人口還沒芬蘭多"}, {"zh-tw": " I mean, I've beento some states in America and I was the only person there. Really. Really.", "en": " 我去過美國的一些州 就只有我一個人"}, {"zh-tw": " I was asked to lock up when I left.

They recognize that it's studentswho are learning and the system has to engage them, their curiosity, their individuality,and their creativity.", "en": " 做法之一是：教學與學習個人化 他們認為，學生是學習的主體 教育體系應該吸引學生 重視好奇心、個別性、創造力"}, {"zh-tw": " That's how you get them to learn. The second is that they attributea very high status to the teaching profession.", "en": " 才能讓學生想要學習 第二種做法是： 給教師崇高的地位"}, {"zh-tw": " They recognizethat you can't improve education if you don't pick great people to teachand keep giving them constant supportand professional development. Investing in professionaldevelopment is not a cost.", "en": " 他們認為教育不可能改善 除非挑選優秀人才教書、 除非給老師不斷支持、 以及專業發展機會 老師的專業發展不是花費"}, {"zh-tw": " It's an investment, and every other countrythat's succeeding well knows that, whether it's Australia, Canada, South Korea, Singapore,Hong Kong or Shanghai. They know that to be the case.", "en": " 而是投資 每個成功的國家都清楚這點 不論澳洲、加拿大、韓國、新加坡、 香港、上海。大家都清楚這點"}, {"zh-tw": " And the third is, they devolve responsibilityto the school level for getting the job done.

The trouble is that educationdoesn't go on in the committee roomsof our legislative buildings.", "en": " 由中央政府決定 或由州政府決定 他們覺得自己最懂，因此發號施令 問題是，教育並不是在 立法機關的會議室進行的"}, {"zh-tw": " It happens in classrooms and schools, and the people who do itare the teachers and the students, and if you remove their discretion,it stops working. You have to put it back to the people.", "en": " 而是在教室和學校進行的 老師和學生是教育的主體 如果剝奪了他們的自主權就會產生問題 必須把自主權還給他們"}, {"zh-tw": " There is wonderful workhappening in this country.

And the reason I think is this: that many of the current policies are based on mechanisticconceptions of education.", "en": " 變成要不斷逆風航行 我認為原因在於 許多現行教育政策，是基於 把教育當作機器的觀念"}, {"zh-tw": " It's like educationis an industrial process that can be improvedjust by having better data, and somewhere in the back of the mindof some policy makers is this idea that if we fine-tune itwell enough, if we just get it right, it will all hum along perfectlyinto the future.

It's a human system.", "en": " 關鍵在於，教育不是機械的系統"}, {"zh-tw": " It's about people, people who either do wantto learn or don't want to learn. Every student who dropsout of school has a reason for it which is rooted in their own biography.", "en": " 而是人的系統，核心在人 有人想學習、有人不想 每個輟學的孩子，背後都有原因 可能來自他個人經歷"}, {"zh-tw": " They may find it boring.
