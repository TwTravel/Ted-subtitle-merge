Today I brought two recent projects as an example of this.", "en": " 我的工作在於 把我們的生活 與在地環境連結 就如同建築物 總是跟在地風俗民情息息相關 今天我要舉兩個例子 是最近的建築企劃案"}, {"zh-tw": " Both projects are in emerging countries, one in Ethiopia and another one in Tunisia. And also they have in common that the different analyses from different perspectives becomes an essential part of the final piece of architecture.", "en": " 兩個企畫案都在兩個新興的國家 一個在衣索匹亞另一個在突尼西亞 這兩個國家有個相同之處 在於其不同的分析與觀點 皆變成了建築上極為重要的一環"}, {"zh-tw": " The first example started with an invitation to design a multistory shopping mall in Ethiopia's capital city Addis Ababa. And this is the type of building we were shown as an example, to my team and myself, of what we had to design.", "en": " 第一個例子就從接到一個設計案的邀請講起 那是一個設計購物中心的案子 位於阿地斯阿貝巴（衣索匹亞首都） 這個建築物的類型 就是我們團隊所收到的範例 要把購物中心設計成這樣"}, {"zh-tw": " At first, the first thing I thought was, I want to run away. After seeing a few of these buildings -- there are many in the city -- we realized that they have three very big points.", "en": " 我看到這個的第一個念頭就是 我可以落跑嗎？ 在看過幾個像這樣的範例 這種設計在城裡隨處可見 我們知道這些設計都有三個特徵"}, {"zh-tw": " First, these buildings, they are almost empty because they have very large shops where people cannot afford to buy things. Second, they need tons of energy to perform because of the skin treatment with glass that creates heat in the inside, and then you need a lot of cooling.", "en": " 第一購物中心內總是很冷清 因為裡面都是非常大的店面 一般民眾買不起裡面的東西 第二裡面需要相當大的電力供應 因為玻璃帷幕 會使內部溫度升高 因此需要裝設大量空調"}, {"zh-tw": " In a city where this shouldn't happen because they have really mild weather that ranges from 20 to 25 degrees the whole year. And third is that their image has nothing to do with Africa and with Ethiopia.", "en": " 這不應該發生在這個城市 因為當地的氣候非常涼爽 年均溫只有攝氏20-25度 第三這些建築物的外觀設計 跟非洲或衣索匹亞都毫無關係"}, {"zh-tw": " It is a pity in a place that has such rich culture and traditions. Also during our first visit to Ethiopia, I was really captivated by the old merkato that is this open-air structure where thousands of people, they go and buy things every day from small vendors.", "en": " 這對於一個擁有豐富文化與傳統的地方來說實在非常可惜 我們首次造訪衣索匹亞時 我對於老莫卡托尤其喜愛 那是一個開放式結構 每天都有幾千人進去 跟小攤販買東西"}, {"zh-tw": " And also it has this idea of the public space that uses the outdoors to create activity. So I thought, this is what I really want to design, not a shopping mall.", "en": " 這就是運用公共場所的想法 用開放空間創造商機 我想這就是我真正想設計的東西 而不是一個購物中心"}, {"zh-tw": " But the question was how we could do a multistory, contemporary building with these principles. The next challenge was when we looked at the site, that is, in a really growing area of the city, where most of these buildings that you see in the image, they were not there.", "en": " 但問題在於怎麼把這些原則 運用在一個多樓層的現代建築 另一個挑戰是我們去看建築地時 當然 是在城市裡非常繁榮的地方 大部分建築就跟照片裡一樣 不在那邊"}, {"zh-tw": " And it's also between two parallel streets that don't have any connection for hundreds of meters. So the first thing we did was to create a connection between these two streets, putting all the entrances of the building.", "en": " 它也在兩條平行路之間 兩條路在幾公里內都無相交 我們第一項要做的事就是讓 兩條路有交點 讓建築物到處都有入口可進出"}, {"zh-tw": " And this extends with an inclined atrium that creates an open-air space in the building that self-protects itself with its own shape from the sun and the rain. And around this void we placed this idea of the market with small shops, that change in each floor because of the shape of the void.", "en": " 使建築有一個傾斜的天井 就成了一個開放空間 這種造型設計也達到了 遮陽擋雨的目的 在此天井周圍 能設置很多的小攤販 此造型也讓每層樓都有不同風貌"}, {"zh-tw": " I also thought, how to close the building? And I really wanted to find a solution that would respond to the local climate conditions. And I started thinking about the textile like a shell made of concrete with perforations that would let the air in, and also the light, but in a filtered way.", "en": " 我又再想怎麼關閉這棟建築？ 我很想找出個方法 迎合當地的天氣狀況 我想到用布料 在貝殼狀的建築物外 穿孔能讓空氣進入 陽光也能進入 但不是直射"}, {"zh-tw": " And then the inspiration came from these beautiful patterns of the Ethiopian women's dresses. That they have fractal geometry properties and this helped me to shape the whole facade.", "en": " 靈感來自於衣索匹亞婦女服飾上那些漂亮的鈕釦 那是一些幾何圖形 幫助我想出了外牆的設計"}, {"zh-tw": " And we are building that with these small prefabricated pieces that are the windows that let the air and the light in a controlled way inside the building. And this is complemented by these small colored glasses that use the light from the inside of the building to light up the building at night.", "en": " 我們只是建造出 有一些預製構件的東西 就是讓空氣與陽光 以被控制的方式進入建築 也補充一些彩色玻璃 讓建築在晚上藉由內部的亮光 讓建築在晚上發亮"}, {"zh-tw": " With these ideas it was not easy first to convince the developers because they were like, \"This is not a shopping mall. We didn't ask for that.\" But then we all realized that this idea of the market happened to be a lot more profitable than the idea of the shopping mall because basically they had more shops to sell. And also that the idea of the facade was much, much cheaper, not only because of the material compared with the glass, but also because we didn't need to have air conditioning anymore.", "en": " 這些想法一開始很難說服那些建商 因為他們只想說 「這不是購物中心！我們沒要你這樣搞啊！」 但最後我們都了解 這類型的市場比購物中心來得賺錢 因為這基本上能容納較多的店家 也因為外牆設計省了非常多的錢 不只是因為省去玻璃帷幕的關係 也因為裡面完全用不著吹冷氣"}, {"zh-tw": " So we created some budget savings that we used to implement the project. And the first implementation was to think about how we could make the building self-sufficient in terms of energy in a city that has electricity cuts almost every day.", "en": " 藉由實行這些方法 這就省下了不少預算 第一個成就就是 怎麼讓建築自供電力 因為城裡幾乎每天都有斷電措施"}, {"zh-tw": " So we created a huge asset by placing photovoltaics there on the roof. And then under those panels we thought about the roof like a new public space with gathering areas and bars that would create this urban oasis.", "en": " 所以我們在屋頂設置相當多的太陽能板 在那些太陽能板下面 能增加一個新的公共場所一個聚會場所或是酒吧 這能造就一個都市綠洲"}, {"zh-tw": " And these porches on the roof, all together they collect the water to reuse for sanitation on the inside. Hopefully by the beginning of next year, because we are already on the fifth floor of the construction.", "en": " 而這些頂樓的入口 能收集水並讓內部的公共衛生設施重複利用 我們極有希望在明年初就能完工因為進度已經建到了第五層樓"}, {"zh-tw": " The second example is a master plan of 2,000 apartments and facilities in the city of Tunis. And for doing such a big project, the biggest project I've ever designed, I really needed to understand the city of Tunis, but also its surroundings and the tradition and culture.", "en": " 第二個例子是一個總體設計 在突尼斯市的兩千戶公寓 做這個非常大的企劃案事實上是我接過最大的企劃案 我需要非常了解突尼斯這個城市 不管是周圍的事物或是當地的傳統與文化"}, {"zh-tw": " During that analysis I paid special attention to the medina that is this 1,000-year-old structure that used to be closed by a wall, opened by twelve different gates, connected by almost straight lines. When I went to the site, the first design operation we did was to extend the existing streets, creating 12 initial blocks similar in size and characteristics to the ones we have in Barcelona and other cities in Europe with these courtyards.", "en": " 在分析過程中我對麥地那有很特別的印象 那是一個用城牆包覆住的結構已有上千年歷史 有12個不同的大門幾乎是用直線連接 當我去到當地第一件要做的就是 拓寬街道，造出12個基礎模塊 相同大小與特性跟巴塞隆納的一樣 在歐洲其他城市也有的庭院"}, {"zh-tw": " On top of that, we selected some strategic points reminded of this idea of the gates and connecting them by straight lines, and this modified this initial pattern. And the last operation was to think about the cell, the small cell of the project, like the apartment, as an essential part of the master plan.", "en": " 我們做了幾個關鍵要點 有了大門用直線聯結的啟發 這更改了最初的格局 最後的工作就是那些房間 就像是公寓裡的小房間 是這個企劃最重要的環節"}, {"zh-tw": " And for that I thought, what would be the best orientation in the Mediterranean climate for an apartment? And it's north-south, because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house and then a natural ventilation. So we overlap a pattern that makes sure that most of the apartments are perfectly oriented in that direction.", "en": " 對於這個我一直想什麼是最能適應 地中海型氣候的公寓？ 南北向的房子讓室內前後溫度不均 并帶來自然的通風 所以我們修改了部分格局確保大部分公寓 都是面對好的方位"}, {"zh-tw": " And this is the result that is almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city. It has these blocks with courtyards, and then on the ground floor you have all these connections for the pedestrians.", "en": " 這就是成果 這就像是結合了歐洲與阿拉伯風格的城市 在中庭有這種街道 在底層 行人都能暢行無阻"}, {"zh-tw": " And also it responds to the local regulations that establish a higher density on the upper levels and a lower density on the ground floor. And it also reinforces this idea of the gates.", "en": " 這也迎合了當地的規矩 就是高樓層較多住戶低樓層則較少住戶 這也在大門加強了這種概念"}, {"zh-tw": " The volume has this connecting shape that shades itself with three different types of apartments and also lets the light go on the ground floor in a very dense neighborhood And in the courtyards there are the different facilities, such as a gym and a kindergarten and close by, a series of commercial [spaces] that bring activity to the ground floor. The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost like giving back to the community the space taken by the construction.", "en": " 這空間的形狀 也替三種不同的公寓遮陰 也能讓陽光透過非常密集的公寓群 在中庭有不同的設施 例如健身房和幼稚園 在低樓層附近也有商業空間帶來商機 屋頂是我最喜歡的部分 那就像是還給社區被建築佔去的空間"}, {"zh-tw": " And it's where all the neighbors, they can go up and socialize, and do activities such as having a two-kilometer run in the morning, jumping from one building to another. These two examples, they have a common approach in the design process.", "en": " 也提供住戶一個社交的場所 或是能在上頭做兩公里的晨跑 也能在每棟房子間跳來跳去 這兩個例子 都有相同的設計方法"}, {"zh-tw": " And also, they are in emerging countries where you can see the cities literally growing. In these cities, the impact of architecture in people's lives of today and tomorrow changes the local communities and economies at the same speed as the buildings grow.", "en": " 也同樣存在於 正在成長的新興城市 在這些城市建築影響著人們的生活 改變了在地社區與經濟與建築一起成長"}, {"zh-tw": " For this reason, I see even more importance to look at architecture finding simple but affordable solutions that enhance the relationship between the community and the environment and that aim to connect nature and people. Thank you very much.", "en": " 就因為這幾個原因讓我覺得 尋找簡單又經濟的方法是非常重要的 目的在於加強社區與環境的聯結 講人類與自然聯繫在一起 謝謝大家"}], "title": "Xavier Vilalta Architecture At Home In Its Community"}
