He is splendidly attired in his 68,000-dollar uniform, befitting the role of the French Academy as legislating the correct usage in French and perpetuating the language.", "en": " 這是莫理斯圖翁 他是法蘭西學院的 榮譽終身院士 他身穿價值六萬八千美元的華麗院士服 與他在法蘭西學院的職責十分相稱 他的工作是負責規範 法文的正確用法 並確保法文永垂不朽"}, {"zh-tw": " The French Academy has two main tasks: it compiles a dictionary of official French. They're now working on their ninth edition, which they began in 1930, and they've reached the letter P.", "en": " 法蘭西學術院肩負兩項使命： 編纂官方版的法文字典-- 現在正在編第九版 他們從1930年就開始了，現在編到字母P"}, {"zh-tw": " They also legislate on correct usage, such as the proper term for what the French call \"email,\" which ought to be \"courriel.\" The World Wide Web, the French are told, ought to be referred to as \"la toile d'araignee mondiale\" -- the Global Spider Web -- recommendations that the French gaily ignore. Now, this is one model of how language comes to be: namely, it's legislated by an academy.", "en": " 這些人也規範語言的正確用法 例如，\"email\"的準確叫法 應該是\"courriel\" 而網際網路 \"World Wide Web\" 應該要稱為 \"la toile d'araignee mondiale\"--全球蜘蛛網 種種法國人興高采烈地忽略的建議 好，這是語言演化的模式之一 也就是由學術研究院規範語言"}, {"zh-tw": " But anyone who looks at language realizes that this is a rather silly conceit, that language, rather, emerges from human minds interacting from one another. And this is visible in the unstoppable change in language -- the fact that by the time the Academy finishes their dictionary, it will already be well out of date.", "en": " 但研究語言的人都會知道 這是個有點愚蠢的妄想 我們都知道，語言源自於人與人之間的互動 我們看到，語言不斷在改變 等到法蘭西學院編完他們的字典 這本字典早就過時了"}, {"zh-tw": " We see it in the constant appearance of slang and jargon, of the historical change in languages, in divergence of dialects and the formation of new languages. So language is not so much a creator or shaper of human nature, so much as a window onto human nature.", "en": " 我們也看到 新的俚語和行話不斷出現 語言歷經歷史演變 方言產生分歧 新的語言形成 因此，不能說語言創造或塑造了人性 語言反倒是個窗口，讓我們得以一窺人性"}, {"zh-tw": " In a book that I'm currently working on, I hope to use language to shed light on a number of aspects of human nature, including the cognitive machinery with which humans conceptualize the world and the relationship types that govern human interaction. And I'm going to say a few words about each one this morning.", "en": " 在我正在撰寫的這本書中 我希望藉由語言來闡述 人性的某些面向 包括認知機制 也就是人類理解世界的機制 還有掌管人際互動的各種關係 今天早上，我會針對這幾項逐一簡述"}, {"zh-tw": " Let me start off with a technical problem in language that I've worried about for quite some time -- and indulge me in my passion for verbs and how they're used. The problem is, which verbs go in which constructions? The verb is the chassis of the sentence.", "en": " 首先，我要談談語言裡的一個技術性問題 這個問題困擾我許久了 也請各位容我分享 我對動詞和動詞用法的熱情 這個問題就是，什麼動詞用在什麼句構裡？ 動詞是一個句子的基礎"}, {"zh-tw": " It's the framework onto which the other parts are bolted. Let me give you a quick reminder of something that you've long forgotten.", "en": " 讓其他詞類可以建構於其上 讓我很快地提醒各位 一件大家早就忘記的事"}, {"zh-tw": " An intransitive verb, such as \"dine,\" for example, can't take a direct object. You have to say, \"Sam dined,\" not, \"Sam dined the pizza.\" A transitive verb mandates that there has to be an object there: \"Sam devoured the pizza.\" You can't just say, \"Sam devoured.\" There are dozens or scores of verbs of this type, each of which shapes its sentence.", "en": " 不及物動詞，像是用餐 (dine) 這個字 後面不能接直接受詞 你要說 \"山姆用餐了\"，不能說 \"山姆用餐披薩\" 而及物動詞的規則是 後面一定要接受詞 \"山姆吞下了 (devour) 披薩\"，不能說 \"山姆吞下了\" 還有很多像這樣的動詞 每個動詞都塑造了句子的樣貌"}, {"zh-tw": " So, a problem in explaining how children learn language, a problem in teaching language to adults so that they don't make grammatical errors, and a problem in programming computers to use language is which verbs go in which constructions. For example, the dative construction in English.", "en": " 所以，該如何解釋兒童習得語言的方法 該如何教成人學語言，讓他們不會犯文法錯誤 該怎麼設計程式，讓電腦使用語言 問題都出在於：什麼動詞用在什麼句構裡？ 以英文的授與句型為例"}, {"zh-tw": " You can say, \"Give a muffin to a mouse,\" the prepositional dative. Or, \"Give a mouse a muffin,\" the double-object dative.", "en": " 你可以用介詞授與： \"把小蛋糕給老鼠\" 或使用雙受詞授與： \"給老鼠小蛋糕\""}, {"zh-tw": " \"Promise anything to her,\" \"Promise her anything,\" and so on. Hundreds of verbs can go both ways.", "en": " \"把任何承諾給她\"、 \"給她任何承諾\" 等等 有上百個動詞在兩種句法裡都行得通"}, {"zh-tw": " So a tempting generalization for a child, for an adult, for a computer is that any verb that can appear in the construction, \"subject-verb-thing-to-a-recipient\" can also be expressed as \"subject-verb-recipient-thing.\" A handy thing to have, because language is infinite, and you can't just parrot back the sentences that you've heard. You've got to extract generalizations so you can produce and understand new sentences.", "en": " 於是小孩很容易以此類推 大人和電腦也是 認為任何動詞只要能放在 \"主詞+動詞+事物+to 受格\" 這種句構裡 就也能出現在: \"主詞+動詞+受格+事物\" 這種句子裡 這樣的推斷很方便 因為語言無窮盡 你沒辦法重述所聽到的每句話 所以你得歸納出一些規則 好讓你可以造出並理解新的句子"}, {"zh-tw": " This would be an example of how to do that. Unfortunately, there appear to be idiosyncratic exceptions.", "en": " 剛剛的用法就是一例 不幸地，有許多不尋常的例外"}, {"zh-tw": " You can say, \"Biff drove the car to Chicago,\" but not, \"Biff drove Chicago the car.\" You can say, \"Sal gave Jason a headache,\" but it's a bit odd to say, \"Sal gave a headache to Jason.\" The solution is that these constructions, despite initial appearance, are not synonymous, that when you crank up the microscope on human cognition, you see that there's a subtle difference in meaning between them. So, \"give the X to the Y,\" that construction corresponds to the thought \"cause X to go to Y.\" Whereas \"give the Y the X\" corresponds to the thought \"cause Y to have X.\" Now, many events can be subject to either construal, kind of like the classic figure-ground reversal illusions, in which you can either pay attention to the particular object, in which case the space around it recedes from attention, or you can see the faces in the empty space, in which case the object recedes out of consciousness.", "en": " 你可以說\"貝夫開車到芝加哥\" 但不能說\"貝夫開芝加哥到車\" 你可以說\"薩爾讓傑森很頭痛\" 但說成\"薩爾把頭痛給了傑森\" 就有點奇怪了 答案就是，這些句構雖然句面上相近 卻不盡相同 如果你把顯微鏡倍數調高一點 用力觀察人類認知，就會發現這些句子 在意義上有些微的差距 所以，\"把X給Y\" 這個句構反映了 \"使X移動到Y那兒去\"，而 \"給YX\" 反映了 \"讓Y有了X\" 好，很多事件都可以解讀為其中一種概念 這有點像是圖與地的錯覺測驗 你可以將注意力放在 某一樣物體上面 這時候，你就會忽略旁邊的背景 你也可以只注意背景中的臉孔 這時候，畫面中的物體就會受到忽略"}, {"zh-tw": " How are these construals reflected in language? Well, in both cases, the thing that is construed as being affected is expressed as the direct object, the noun after the verb. So, when you think of the event as causing the muffin to go somewhere -- where you're doing something to the muffin -- you say, \"Give the muffin to the mouse.\" When you construe it as \"cause the mouse to have something,\" you're doing something to the mouse, and therefore you express it as, \"Give the mouse the muffin.\" So which verbs go in which construction -- the problem with which I began -- depends on whether the verb specifies a kind of motion or a kind of possession change.", "en": " 這樣的解構怎麼反映在語言上面呢？ 嗯，在這兩種情況下，被認為受到影響的事物 以直接受詞的形式出現 也就是動詞後面的名詞 所以如果你認為這個動作使得小蛋糕移動到某處去 也就是你對小蛋糕做動作的地方-- 你會說 \"把小蛋糕給老鼠\" 如果你解讀成 \"使得老鼠獲得了某物\" 你對老鼠做了動作 那麼，你就會說 \"給老鼠小蛋糕\" 所以，什麼動詞用在什麼句構裡-- 我開頭提到的這個問題 取決於該動詞是否點明了一種運動 還是代表著所有權的轉換"}, {"zh-tw": " To give something involves both causing something to go and causing someone to have. To drive the car only causes something to go, because Chicago's not the kind of thing that can possess something.", "en": " 授與某物包括使得某物移動 以及使得某人獲得某物 開車只造成某物移動 因為芝加哥沒辦法擁有某物"}, {"zh-tw": " Only humans can possess things. And to give someone a headache causes them to have the headache, but it's not as if you're taking the headache out of your head and causing it to go to the other person, and implanting it in them.", "en": " 只有人類可以擁有事物 而\"讓某人頭痛\"使得他們頭很痛 但你不能把你的頭痛從腦袋裡取出來 使它移動到別人那兒 然後想辦法讓別人頭痛"}, {"zh-tw": " You may just be loud or obnoxious, or some other way causing them to have the headache. So, that's an example of the kind of thing that I do in my day job.", "en": " 你只能大聲喧鬧或討人厭 或用其他方法使別人頭痛 所以這個例子 就說明了我每天在做的工作"}, {"zh-tw": " So why should anyone care? Well, there are a number of interesting conclusions, I think, from this and many similar kinds of analyses of hundreds of English verbs. First, there's a level of fine-grained conceptual structure, which we automatically and unconsciously compute every time we produce or utter a sentence, that governs our use of language.", "en": " 為什麼有人要在乎這種事？ 嗯，我認為有很多有趣的結論 可以從這種還有許多類似的分析中得出 從分析上百個英文動詞中得出 首先，有種非常微妙的認知結構 是我們自動或下意識地在運用的 影響我們造出或說出每個支配我們語言使用的句子"}, {"zh-tw": " You can think of this as the language of thought, or \"mentalese.\" It seems to be based on a fixed set of concepts, which govern dozens of constructions and thousands of verbs -- not only in English, but in all other languages -- fundamental concepts such as space, time, causation and human intention, such as, what is the means and what is the ends? These are reminiscent of the kinds of categories that Immanuel Kant argued are the basic framework for human thought, and it's interesting that our unconscious use of language seems to reflect these Kantian categories. Doesn't care about perceptual qualities, such as color, texture, weight and speed, which virtually never differentiate the use of verbs in different constructions.", "en": " 你可以把它想成思想的語言，或心理語言 它似乎建構於一種固有的概念之上 這樣的概念支配了十幾種句構和上千個動詞的用法 不只在英文裡，在其他語言裡也有這種 基本的概念，例如，空間 時間、因果關係和動機 像是，哪個是手段，哪個是目的？ 這與\"範疇\"有異曲同工之妙 康德認為這些範疇 組成了人類思想的基本架構 有趣的是，我們下意識中所使用的語言 似乎反映了康德所提出的範疇 我們的語言不在乎感觀的特徵 像是顏色、質地、重量和速度 這些幾乎都不會影響 不同句構中動詞的用法"}, {"zh-tw": " An additional twist is that all of the constructions in English are used not only literally, but in a quasi-metaphorical way. For example, this construction, the dative, is used not only to transfer things, but also for the metaphorical transfer of ideas, as when we say, \"She told a story to me\" or \"told me a story,\" \"Max taught Spanish to the students\" or \"taught the students Spanish.\" It's exactly the same construction, but no muffins, no mice, nothing moving at all.", "en": " 此外，英文裡所有的句構 都不只具有字面的意義 還帶有一些隱喻的意味 比如說，這個授與句型 不只能用來轉讓事物 還能用來移轉想法 像我們說: \"她講故事給我聽\" 或 \"她跟我講故事\" \"馬克斯教授西班牙文給學生\"或\"教學生西班牙文\" 這些都是相同的句構 但句子裡沒有小蛋糕，也沒有老鼠。沒有東西移動"}, {"zh-tw": " It evokes the container metaphor of communication, in which we conceive of ideas as objects, sentences as containers, and communication as a kind of sending. As when we say we \"gather\" our ideas, to \"put\" them \"into\" words, and if our words aren't \"empty\" or \"hollow,\" we might get these ideas \"across\" to a listener, who can \"unpack\" our words to \"extract\" their \"content.\" And indeed, this kind of verbiage is not the exception, but the rule.", "en": " 這就引發了溝通裡的\"容器隱喻\" 我們將想法視為物體 把句子當成容器 而溝通是一種傳送方式 就像我們說，將想法\"收集\"起來，\"放進\"文字裡 而如果我們的話語不至於\"空洞\"或\"空泛\" 我們就可以將想法\"傳達\"給聽者 聽者可以\"拆解\"我們的話語，\"擷取\"其中的\"內容\" 這些用語不是例外，而是規則"}, {"zh-tw": " It's very hard to find any example of abstract language that is not based on some concrete metaphor. For example, you can use the verb \"go\" and the prepositions \"to\" and \"from\" in a literal, spatial sense.", "en": " 很難從抽象的語言中找到任何 不是建立於具體的譬喻之上的例子 舉例而言，你可以用\"去\" (go) 這個動詞 搭配介系詞\"到\"(to) 和\"從\" (from) 表達空間概念"}, {"zh-tw": " \"The messenger went from Paris to Istanbul.\" You can also say, \"Biff went from sick to well.\" He needn't go anywhere. He could have been in bed the whole time, but it's as if his health is a point in state space that you conceptualize as moving. Or, \"The meeting went from three to four,\" in which we conceive of time as stretched along a line.", "en": " \"信差從巴黎去到伊斯坦堡\" 你也可以說 \"貝夫從生病到康復\" 他不用去哪裡，他可能一直都躺在床上 但他的健康就像狀態空間裡的一個點 而你想像這個點會移動 或者， \"會議從三點開到四點\" 我們想像時間綿延於一條線上"}, {"zh-tw": " Likewise, we use \"force\" to indicate not only physical force, as in, \"Rose forced the door to open,\" but also interpersonal force, as in, \"Rose forced Sadie to go,\" not necessarily by manhandling her, but by issuing a threat. Or, \"Rose forced herself to go,\" as if there were two entities inside Rose's head, engaged in a tug of a war.", "en": " 同樣地，我們利用\"force\" (用力、強迫) 指的不只是身體的力量 像是 \"羅絲用力把門打開\" 也可以指涉人際上的力量 像是 \"羅絲強迫珊蒂離開\"--不一定要親自動手 可以利用威脅利誘 或是 \"羅絲強迫自己離開\" 彷彿羅絲腦袋裡有兩個個體 正在進行一場拔河戰"}, {"zh-tw": " Second conclusion is that the ability to conceive of a given event in two different ways, such as \"cause something to go to someone\" and \"causing someone to have something,\" I think is a fundamental feature of human thought, and it's the basis for much human argumentation, in which people don't differ so much on the facts as on how they ought to be construed. Just to give you a few examples: \"ending a pregnancy\" versus \"killing a fetus;\" \"a ball of cells\" versus \"an unborn child;\" \"invading Iraq\" versus \"liberating Iraq;\" \"redistributing wealth\" versus \"confiscating earnings.\" And I think the biggest picture of all would take seriously the fact that so much of our verbiage about abstract events is based on a concrete metaphor and see human intelligence itself as consisting of a repertoire of concepts -- such as objects, space, time, causation and intention -- which are useful in a social, knowledge-intensive species, whose evolution you can well imagine, and a process of metaphorical abstraction that allows us to bleach these concepts of their original conceptual content -- space, time and force -- and apply them to new abstract domains, therefore allowing a species that evolved to deal with rocks and tools and animals, to conceptualize mathematics, physics, law and other abstract domains.", "en": " 我得出的另一個結論是，解構的能力 將一件事情解讀成兩種意義的能力 像是 \"使得某物移動到某人那兒去\" 以及\"使得某人擁有某物\" 是人類思想最基本的特質 也是人們許多爭論的來源 與其說大家對事實爭論不下 不如說他們對事實的解讀方法有不同見解 給各位幾個例子： \"結束妊娠期\" 和 \"殺死胎兒\" \"一團細胞\" 和 \"未出世的孩子\" \"入侵伊拉克\" 和 \"解放伊拉克\" \"重新分配財富\" 和 \"沒收所得\" 而我認為，若採取最宏觀的角度 你會認真地看待一個事實 那就是，我們描述抽象事件的用語 大多建立於具體的譬喻之上 你會將人類的智能本身視為 涵蓋了一系列的概念-- 諸如目的、空間、時間、因果關係和意圖-- 對於需要大量社交和知識的物種非常有用 這個物種的演化各位都很熟悉 而人類智能還包含抽象隱喻的過程 讓我們抽離這些概念裡面 原有的內涵-- 空間、時間和力量-- 然後用在新的抽象領域上 所以一個已經進化到 學會使用石器、工具和禽獸的物種 也能了解數學、物理、法律 和其他抽象的領域"}, {"zh-tw": " Well, I said I'd talk about two windows on human nature -- the cognitive machinery with which we conceptualize the world, and now I'm going to say a few words about the relationship types that govern human social interaction, again, as reflected in language. And I'll start out with a puzzle, the puzzle of indirect speech acts.", "en": " 嗯，我說我會講到人性的兩扇窗口： 剛剛提到我們解構這個世界的認知機制 現在我要講的是不同類型的人際關係 它們掌控了人類的社交互動 以及這些關係如何反映在語言上面 我首先要講個謎題：間接語言行為的謎題"}, {"zh-tw": " Now, I'm sure most of you have seen the movie \"Fargo.\" And you might remember the scene in which the kidnapper is pulled over by a police officer, is asked to show his driver's license and holds his wallet out with a 50-dollar bill extending at a slight angle out of the wallet. And he says, \"I was just thinking that maybe we could take care of it here in Fargo,\" which everyone, including the audience, interprets as a veiled bribe.", "en": " 相信很多人都看過《冰血暴》這部電影 你可能記得在其中一幕裡 警察攔下綁匪的車 請他出示駕照 而綁匪舉起皮夾 裡頭露出一張五十美元的鈔票 以微妙的角度若隱若現著 他說：\"我在想\" \"也許我們可以就地解決\" 每個人，包括電影觀眾 都會將這句話解讀為隱含的賄賂"}, {"zh-tw": " This kind of indirect speech is rampant in language. For example, in polite requests, if someone says, \"If you could pass the guacamole, that would be awesome,\" we know exactly what he means, even though that's a rather bizarre concept being expressed.", "en": " 這種不直接的表達方法在語言裡隨處可見 舉例來說，在禮貌性的請求中 如果有人說 \"如果你能遞給我鱷梨沙拉醬\" \"那就太棒了\" 我們都知道他要表達什麼意思 雖然他表達的概念 實在有點詭異"}, {"zh-tw": " \"Would you like to come up and see my etchings?\" I think most people understand the intent behind that. And likewise, if someone says, \"Nice store you've got there. It would be a real shame if something happened to it\" -- -- we understand that as a veiled threat, rather than a musing of hypothetical possibilities.", "en": " \"妳想來我家欣賞我的蝕刻畫嗎？\" 我想大部份的人 都知道這句話背後的動機是什麼 同樣地，如果有人說 \"你的店真不賴，如果發生什麼不幸，那真是太可惜了\" 我們也都了解這背後隱含的是個恐嚇 而不是真的在思考這個假設的可能性"}, {"zh-tw": " So the puzzle is, why are bribes, polite requests, solicitations and threats so often veiled? No one's fooled. Both parties know exactly what the speaker means, and the speaker knows the listener knows that the speaker knows that the listener knows, etc., etc.", "en": " 所以這個謎題是，為什麼賄賂、 有禮的請求、誘惑和恐嚇都常被隱藏起來？ 沒有人會信以為真-- 雙方都了解講者的意思為何 講者也知道聽者知道 講者知道聽者知道...以此類推"}, {"zh-tw": " So what's going on? I think the key idea is that language is a way of negotiating relationships, and human relationships fall into a number of types. There's an influential taxonomy by the anthropologist Alan Fiske, in which relationships can be categorized, more or less, into communality, which works on the principle \"what's mine is thine, what's thine is mine,\" the kind of mindset that operates within a family, for example; dominance, whose principle is \"don't mess with me;\" reciprocity, \"you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours;\" and sexuality, in the immortal words of Cole Porter, \"Let's do it.\" Now, relationship types can be negotiated.", "en": " 究竟是怎麼一回事？ 我認為關鍵在於語言 讓我們可以協商彼此的關係為何 而人際關係有好幾種類型 人類學家費斯克提出了一種有名的分類法 他說，人與人間的關係或多或少可以分成幾種模式 團體關係，其原則是 \"我的就是你的，你的就是我的\"-- 這種關係常見於家人之間 統治關係，最高指導原則是\"別惹我\" 互惠關係：\"你幫我抓背，我就幫你抓背\" 性慾關係，套句柯爾波特的名言：\"咱們做吧\" 這些關係模式是可以經過協商的"}, {"zh-tw": " Even though there are default situations in which one of these mindsets can be applied, they can be stretched and extended. For example, communality applies most naturally within family or friends, but it can be used to try to transfer the mentality of sharing to groups that ordinarily would not be disposed to exercise it.", "en": " 即使在某些既定的情況下 適用上述其中一種關係模式 但仍有延伸擴大的空間 舉例來說，團體關係最常出現在 家人或朋友關係中 但也可以用來試圖將 分享的心態 轉移到平常不這麼運作的群體"}, {"zh-tw": " For example, in brotherhoods, fraternal organizations, sororities, locutions like \"the family of man,\" you try to get people who are not related to use the relationship type that would ordinarily be appropriate to close kin. Now, mismatches -- when one person assumes one relationship type, and another assumes a different one -- can be awkward.", "en": " 例如，兄弟會、兄弟組織 姊妹會中，\"兄弟一家親\"這種慣用語 就是想要讓一群非親非故的人 使用這種平常只適用於 近親的關係模式 但差異出現時--一個人以為是某種關係模式 另一個人以為是另一種模式--就糗大了"}, {"zh-tw": " If you went over and you helped yourself to a shrimp off your boss' plate, for example, that would be an awkward situation. Or if a dinner guest after the meal pulled out his wallet and offered to pay you for the meal, that would be rather awkward as well.", "en": " 如果你伸筷自行取用 你老闆盤裡的蝦子 這個情況可能就尷尬了 或是來家裡用餐的客人在飯後 取出錢包要付你餐費 那也相當難堪"}, {"zh-tw": " In less blatant cases, there's still a kind of negotiation that often goes on. In the workplace, for example, there's often a tension over whether an employee can socialize with the boss, or refer to him or her on a first-name basis.", "en": " 在比較不明顯的情境裡 也常進行著關係模式的協商 舉例來說，在工作場合上 常常有個兩難：究竟員工 能不能跟老闆聊天 或是直呼他或她 的大名"}, {"zh-tw": " If two friends have a reciprocal transaction, like selling a car, it's well known that this can be a source of tension or awkwardness. In dating, the transition from friendship to sex can lead to, notoriously, various forms of awkwardness, and as can sex in the workplace, in which we call the conflict between a dominant and a sexual relationship \"sexual harassment.\" Well, what does this have to do with language? Well, language, as a social interaction, has to satisfy two conditions.", "en": " 如果兩個朋友要進行一項 互惠交易，像是賣車 大家都知道這可能造成 兩難或窘境 兩人約會 想要從友情發展到性關係 可能造成各種的窘境，這眾所皆知 辦公室裡的性關係亦然 我們稱這種發生在 統治關係與性慾關係間的衝突為\"性騷擾\" 那，這些和語言有什麼關係？ 嗯，語言，就像社交 需要符合兩種條件"}, {"zh-tw": " You have to convey the actual content -- here we get back to the container metaphor. You want to express the bribe, the command, the promise, the solicitation and so on, but you also have to negotiate and maintain the kind of relationship you have with the other person.", "en": " 你必須表達實質內容-- 這邊我們要回到容器隱喻 你想要傳達賄賂、命令、承諾 誘惑等等意含 但你必須要協商 同時維持 你和對方之間的關係"}, {"zh-tw": " The solution, I think, is that we use language at two levels: the literal form signals the safest relationship with the listener, whereas the implicated content -- the reading between the lines that we count on the listener to perform -- allows the listener to derive the interpretation which is most relevant in context, which possibly initiates a changed relationship. The simplest example of this is in the polite request.", "en": " 我想，解決方法就是我們用的語言要有兩個層次： 字面上的意思表達了 你和聽者最安全的關係 而你暗指的內容-- 我們希望對方聽到的弦外之音-- 讓聽者解讀出 在情境裡最切題的意義 這可能會造成關係的改變 最簡單的例子就是有禮的請求"}, {"zh-tw": " If you express your request as a conditional -- \"if you could open the window, that would be great\" -- even though the content is an imperative, the fact that you're not using the imperative voice means that you're not acting as if you're in a relationship of dominance, where you could presuppose the compliance of the other person. On the other hand, you want the damn guacamole.", "en": " 如果你以假設句傳達你的請求 \"如果你能開個窗就太好了\" 雖然這句話的內容是命令句 但是你没有使用命令語氣 表示你並沒有表現得好像你們處於統治關係 你沒有假設對方一定會屈從 另一方面，你想要那該死的鱷梨沙拉醬"}, {"zh-tw": " By expressing it as an if-then statement, you can get the message across without appearing to boss another person around.

And you can think of it in terms of a game-theoretic payoff matrix.", "en": " 我們可以這麼思考：想像一下 如果我們只能使用語言字面的意思，會是什麼情況 你可以用 賽局理論裡的收益矩陣來分析"}, {"zh-tw": " Put yourself in the position of the kidnapper wanting to bribe the officer.
