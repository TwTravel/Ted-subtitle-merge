But I have to ask: what if she didn't have to take that risk? Why did she have to go through all that? Why wasn't there a legal wayfor her to study in Europe? Why couldn't Masa have takenan airplane to Sweden? Why couldn't Bassem have found work? Why is there no massive resettlementprogram for Syrian refugees, the victims of the worst war of our times? The world did this for the Vietnamesein the 1970s. Why not now? Why is there so little investmentin the neighboring countries hosting so many refugees?

One thing is for sure, that no refugee would beon those dangerous boats if they could thrive where they are.", "en": " 沒有任何逃離戰爭或迫害的人， 應該在橫渡海洋以抵達安全之處時死亡。 有件可以確定的事是 如果他們可以在所在之處安然度日， 沒有難民會在那些危險的船上。"}, {"zh-tw": " And no migrant would takethat dangerous journey if they had enough foodfor themselves and their children.
