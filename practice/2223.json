Was it about me as a child refugee, or as a woman who set up a high-techsoftware company back in the 1960s, one that went public and eventually employed over 8,500 people? Or was it as a motherof an autistic child? Or as a philanthropist that'snow given away serious money? Well, it turns out, I'm all of these.", "en": " 我在寫我的回憶錄時， 出版商都覺得很困惑。 他們不確定這本書是要談我童年的難民故事， 是要談一個女人如何在 60 年代創辦一家高科技軟體公司， 公開上市， 並聘用超過 8500 名員工？ 是要談自閉症小孩母親的心路歷程？ 又或是談一個慈善家為何捐出大把家產? 結果是以上皆是。"}, {"zh-tw": " So let me tell you my story. All that I am stems from whenI got onto a train in Vienna, part of the Kindertransport that savednearly 10,000 Jewish children from Nazi Europe.", "en": " 現在就讓我來談談我的故事。 一切都得從我在維也納跳上一班火車開始， 那班火車是孩童援救計劃之一，從納粹佔領的歐洲拯救了 近一萬名猶太兒童。"}, {"zh-tw": " I was five years old, clutching the handof my nine-year-old sister and had very little idea as to what was going on. \"What is England and why am I going there?\" I'm only alive because so long ago, I was helped by generous strangers.", "en": " 我那時候五歲，緊緊抓著我九歲姊姊的手。 我根本不知道發生什麼事。 「什麼是英國？為什麼要去哪裡？」 我之所以能存活，是因為很久以前我受到慷慨陌生人的幫助。"}, {"zh-tw": " I was lucky, and doubly luckyto be later reunited with my birth parents. But, sadly, I never bonded with them again.", "en": " 我很幸運，超級幸運， 才能在日後與我的親生父母重聚。 但難過的是，我們之間沒辦法再建立緊密的親情聯結。"}, {"zh-tw": " But I've done more in the seven decadessince that miserable day when my mother put me on the train than I would ever have dreamed possible. And I love England, my adopted country, with a passion that perhaps only someonewho has lost their human rights can feel.", "en": " 從那苦難日，我媽媽把我送上火車之後， 70 年來，我做過很多事情， 遠遠超過我的想像。 我喜愛英國，這個接納我的國家。 這種熱愛，或許只有喪失過人權的人才能感受。"}, {"zh-tw": " I decided to make mine a lifethat was worth saving. And then, I just got on with it.", "en": " 我決定讓我的人生有意義，才能回報救過我的人， 誰知道後來有點欲罷不能。"}, {"zh-tw": " Let me take you back to the early 1960s. To get past the gender issues of the time, I set up my own software house at oneof the first such startups in Britain.", "en": " 讓我從 1960 年代早期開始講起。 因為當時有性別歧視的問題， 我成立了自己的軟體公司。英國第一批軟體公司之一。"}, {"zh-tw": " But it was also a company of women,a company for women, an early social business. And people laughed at the very ideabecause software, at that time, was given away free with hardware.", "en": " 這家公司只有女性員工，提供女性就業機會， 算是早期的社會企業。 人們覺得這種作法很可笑，因為當時 軟體是隨硬體贈送的產品。"}, {"zh-tw": " Nobody would buy software,certainly not from a woman. Although women were then coming outof the universities with decent degrees, there was a glass ceiling to our progress.", "en": " 沒有人會買軟體，當然更不會跟婦女買。 雖然當時婦女開始取得體面的大學學歷， 玻璃天花板對婦女的職業生涯仍是一道無形阻隔。"}, {"zh-tw": " And I'd hit that glass ceiling too often, and I wanted opportunities for women.

Our late son, Giles, was an only child,a beautiful, contented baby.", "en": " 就我而言，我的成功夾雜著家庭創傷和危機。 我已過世的獨子賈爾斯是一個美麗，隨遇而安的小孩。"}, {"zh-tw": " And then, at two and a half, like a changeling in a fairy story, he lost the little speech that he had and turned into a wild, unmanageable toddler. Not the terrible twos; he was profoundly autistic and he never spoke again.", "en": " 在他二歲半的時候， 像是童話故事裡被仙女偷換的小孩， 他不再說話 變成一個任性、不聽話的小孩。 他不是一般可怕的兩歲小孩； 他有嚴重的自閉症，而且從此不再開口說話。"}, {"zh-tw": " Giles was the first resident in the firsthouse of the first charity that I set up to pioneer services for autism.

Philanthropy is all that I do now.", "en": " 我已學會習慣沒有他在身邊的日子， 我學會習慣他不再需要我的的日子。 現在我把重心放在慈善事業上。"}, {"zh-tw": " I need never worry about getting lost because several charitieswould quickly come and find me. It's one thing to have an idea for an enterprise, but as many people in this room will know, making it happen is a very difficult thing and it demands extraordinary energy,self-belief and determination, the courage to risk family and home, and a 24/7 commitment that borders on the obsessive.", "en": " 我從不會擔心迷路 因為有許多慈善機構很快就會找到我。 有創業的想法是一回事， 但在座的各位也知道， 要實現想法是件很困難的事 我們需要超乎常人的精力，要有自信和決心， 承擔家庭問題風險的勇氣， 全年無休地獻身在自己的事業上。"}, {"zh-tw": " So it's just as wellthat I'm a workaholic. I believe in the beauty of work when wedo it properly and in humility.", "en": " 所以幸好我是個工作狂。 我相信工作的美好只要我們能以正確和謙卑的心將工作做好。"}, {"zh-tw": " Work is not just something I dowhen I'd rather be doing something else.
