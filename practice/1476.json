And what narrative, what history, what identity, what moral code are we imparting to our young? Cinema is arguably the 20th century's most influential art form. Its artists told stories across national boundaries, in as many languages, genres and philosophies as one can imagine.", "en": " 但在日漸世俗、破碎無條理的世界中 我們要在哪裡分享共通的經驗 且不受到浮誇消費主義的影響？ 而哪種敘事、歷史 身份、道德規範 我們正在灌輸給我們的年輕人？ 電影可以說是 20世紀以來最有影響力的藝術形式 藝術家藉由電影說故事 跨越國際疆界 語言隔閡、類型和思潮 你想的到電影就做得到"}, {"zh-tw": " Indeed, it is hard to find a subject that film has yet to tackle.

The irony is palpable; technical access has never been greater, cultural access never weaker. And so in 2006 we set up FILMCLUB, an organization that ran weekly film screenings in schools followed by discussions.", "en": " 我們的年輕人要如何創造未來？ 他們如此缺乏 對自身背景的了解 對未來的可能性，也幾乎沒有文本可參照 這十分諷刺 當科技史無前例的發達 接觸文化的機會卻前所未有的貧乏 在2006年我們創立「電影俱樂部」組織 每週在學校放映電影 並舉辦映後座談"}, {"zh-tw": " If we could raid the annals of 100 years of film, maybe we could build a narrative that would deliver meaning to the fragmented and restless world of the young.

And the stories they held provided a shared experience.", "en": " 電影跨越各種分界而帶來共通性 用故事以提供共通經驗"}, {"zh-tw": " \"Persepolis\" brought a daughter closer to her Iranian mother, and \"Jaws\" became the way in which one young boy was able to articulate the fear he'd experienced in flight from violence that killed first his father then his mother, the latter thrown overboard on a boat journey. Who was right, who wrong? What would they do under the same conditions? Was the tale told well? Was there a hidden message? How has the world changed? How could it be different? A tsunami of questions flew out of the mouths of children who the world didn't think were interested.", "en": " 《茉莉人生》讓一位女兒與伊朗籍母親更加親近 《大白鯊》讓一位年輕男孩有辦法 說出他害怕的感受和經驗 當他逃離一場暴力事件 在這場事件裡他的父親與母親被殺害 接著母親在途中被丟下船 誰對、誰錯？ 在同樣的狀況下他們該怎麼做？ 故事有沒有說明白？ 有沒有隱藏含義？ 這世界怎麼改變？如何變得不一樣？ 許多問題從孩童口中如海嘯般的湧來 我們過去以為他們不會關心這些事"}, {"zh-tw": " And they themselves had not known they cared.

As one 12-year-old said after watching \"Wizard of Oz,\" \"Every person should watch this, because unless you do you may not know that you too have a heart.\" We honor reading, why not honor watching with the same passion?
