We've lost millions of acresof coastal mangroves over the last 30 or 40 years.", "en": " 但是，許多沿海紅樹林卻落得此下場。 在過去30-40年裡， 我們喪失了上百萬畝的沿海紅樹林。"}, {"zh-tw": " That rate of destruction has slowed, but we're stillin a major mangrove deficit.

Our own management area, called a Regional FisheriesManagement Organization, is called ICCAT, the International Commissionfor the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas.", "en": " 這些大範圍的管理區域必須接受監測， 目的是更好地管理對鮪魚的捕撈。 我們的「區域漁業管理組織」， 簡稱「ICCAT」， 「大西洋鮪類保育委員會」的簡稱。"}, {"zh-tw": " The great naturalistCarl Safina once called it, \"The International Conspiracyto Catch all the Tunas.\" Of course we've seenincredible improvement in ICCAT in the last few years, there is total room for improvement, but it remains to be saidthat tuna is a global fish, and to manage it,we have to manage the globe. Well, we could also try to grow tuna but tuna is a spectacularly badanimal for aquaculture.", "en": " 偉大的自然學家Carl Safina曾經戲稱為： 「撈光所有鮪魚的國際陰謀會」。 當然，我們看到ICCAT 在過去兩年的巨大進步， 雖然還有很大的改善空間， 鮪魚是不是全球性魚類雖仍有待商榷， 但要管理它，我們就必須全球管理， 我們也可以試試養殖鮪魚， 但鮪魚極不適合水產養殖。"}, {"zh-tw": " Many people don't know thisbut tuna are warm-blooded. They can heat their bodies 20 degreesabove ambient temperature, they can swim at over 40 miles an hour.", "en": " 很多人可能不知道，其實鮪魚是溫血動物。 它們可以使自己身體的溫度比環境溫度高20度， 鮪魚可以每小時游40英里。"}, {"zh-tw": " So that pretty much eliminates all the advantagesof farming a fish, right? A farmed fish is -- or a fish is cold-blooded,it doesn't move too much. That's a great thing for growing protein.", "en": " 所以這把養殖魚類的優點完全消滅了，對吧？ 水產養殖魚或者一般魚 都是冷血動物，不怎麼運動。 這有利於蛋白質生長。"}, {"zh-tw": " But if you've gotthis crazy, wild creature that swims at 40 miles an hourand heats its blood -- not a great candidate for aquaculture. The next creature -- most consumed seafood in Americaand throughout the West -- is salmon.", "en": " 但要養殖這瘋狂野生動物， 每小時游40英里，又要溫熱血液， 恐怕這對水產養殖來說不是個好選擇。 美國和西方國家消費最多的另一種海鮮是 鮭魚（也稱三文魚）。"}, {"zh-tw": " Now salmon got its plundering, too, but it didn't really necessarilyhappen through fishing. This is my home state of Connecticut.", "en": " 目前鮭魚也很搶手， 但是不必通過漁業來捕捉。 我來自康州。"}, {"zh-tw": " Connecticut used to be hometo a lot of wild salmon. But if you lookat this map of Connecticut, every dot on that map is a dam.", "en": " 康州以前是大量野生鮭魚的棲身地。 但看看康州的這張地圖， 地圖上每個點代表一個堤壩。"}, {"zh-tw": " There are over 3,000 damsin the state of Connecticut. I often say this is why peoplein Connecticut are so uptight -- If somebody could justunblock Connecticut's chi, I feel that we could havean infinitely better world.", "en": " 康州有超過3,000個堤壩。 我常說這就是為什麼康州人脾氣這麼爆躁-- 要是有人能把康州通通氣， 我覺得我們會有一個更美好的世界。"}, {"zh-tw": " But I made this particular comment at a convention onceof national parks officers, and this guy from North Carolinasidled up to me, he says, \"You know, you oughtn't be so hardon your Connecticut, cause we here in North Carolina,we got 35,000 dams.\" So it's a national epidemic,it's an international epidemic. And there are dams everywhere, and these are precisely the things that stop wild salmonfrom reaching their spawning grounds.", "en": " 但是有次我對一個國家公園的工作人員提了這個提議， 有個來自南卡州的人就走過來跟我說： 「你可不要太跟你的康州過不去， 你看我們南卡州這裡，有3萬5千個堤壩呢。」 所以說美國有個堤壩流行病，這也是個全球流行病。 堤壩無處不在， 就是這些堤壩， 讓野生鮭魚無法到達產卵地。"}, {"zh-tw": " So as a result,we've turned to aquaculture, and salmon is one the most successful,at least from a numbers point of view. When they first started farming salmon, it could take as manyas six pounds of wild fish to make a single pound of salmon.", "en": " 因此我們就轉靠水產養殖， 而鮭魚是最成功的水產魚類，至少從數字上看是最成功的。 人們剛開始養殖鮭魚時， 要消耗多達 6 磅野生魚， 才能產出 1 磅鮭魚。"}, {"zh-tw": " The industry has, to its credit,greatly improved. They've gotten it below two to one, although it's a little bit of a cheat because if you look at the wayaquaculture feed is produced, they're measuring pellets -- pounds of pellets per pound of salmon.", "en": " 鮭魚養殖業的確大有進步。 現在是消耗 2 磅產 1 磅， 雖然這其中有一點欺騙性， 因為養殖飼料的生產方式， 是用顆粒計算的， 飼料的磅數比鮭魚的磅數。"}, {"zh-tw": " Those pellets are in turn reduced fish. So the actual -- what's called the FIFO,the fish in and the fish out -- kind of hard to say.", "en": " 而飼料也是用魚製造的。 所以實際魚的投入和產出比--簡稱為 FIFO-- 就很難說出一個正確數字。"}, {"zh-tw": " But in any case, credit to the industry, it has lowered the amount of fishper pound of salmon. Problem is we've also gone crazy with the amount of salmonthat we're producing.", "en": " 但無論如何， 養殖業功勞很大， 降低了生產每磅鮭魚所需的魚量。 問題是：目前我們的鮭魚產量也開始有點瘋狂了。"}, {"zh-tw": " Aquaculture is the fastest growingfood system on the planet. It's growing at somethinglike seven percent per year.", "en": " 水產業是全球發展最快的食物系統。 年均增長率約為7%。"}, {"zh-tw": " And so even thoughwe're doing less per fish to bring it to the market, we're still killinga lot of these little fish. And it's not just fishthat we're feeding fish to, we're also feeding fishto chickens and pigs.", "en": " 雖然我們消耗更少的魚， 產出更多的鮭魚， 我們還是在捕殺很多小魚。 而且我們不僅用魚來餵魚， 我們也用魚餵雞和豬。"}, {"zh-tw": " So we've got chickensand they're eating fish, but weirdly, we also have fishthat are eating chickens. Because the byproducts of chickens --feathers, blood, bone -- get ground up and fed to fish.", "en": " 所以我們吃雞，雞吃魚， 但見怪不怪，我們也有魚吃雞， 因為雞的副產品：雞毛、雞血、雞骨， 會被碾碎用來餵魚。"}, {"zh-tw": " So I often wonder, is there a fish that atea chicken that ate a fish? It's sort of a reworkingof the chicken and egg thing. Anyway -- All together, though,it results in a terrible mess. What you're talking about is something between 20 and 30 millionmetric tons of wild creatures that are taken from the oceanand used and ground up.", "en": " 所以我經常想， 有沒有魚吃過吃過魚的雞？ 好像雞生蛋蛋生雞的問題。好吧—— 總的來說，結果是非常糟糕的。 我們看到的是， 2 - 3千萬公噸的野生動物 從海裡捕撈出來，被碾碎使用。"}, {"zh-tw": " That's the equivalentof a third of a China, or of an entire United States of humans that's taken out of the seaeach and every year. The last of the fouris a kind of amorphous thing.", "en": " 也就是三分之一中國人的重量， 或者是整個美國的總人口體重， 每年從海裡被撈出來。 四種魚裡的最後一種，定義有點模糊，"}, {"zh-tw": " It's what the industry calls \"whitefish.\" There are many fish that get cycledinto this whitefish thing but the way to kind of tellthe story, I think, is through that classic pieceof American culinary innovation, the Filet-O-Fish sandwich. So the Filet-O-Fish sandwichactually started as halibut.", "en": " 業界一般稱為「白魚」。 很多種魚最後變成了所謂的「白魚」， 但要解釋個中故事， 要先提一下美國飲食的革命性發明: 麥香魚堡。 麥香魚堡一開始用的是大比目魚。"}, {"zh-tw": " And it started becausea local franchise owner found that when he servedhis McDonald's on Friday, nobody came. Because it was a Catholiccommunity, they needed fish.", "en": " 原因是當時一個本地食店老闆發現 星期五他的麥當勞店沒有顧客。 因為當地人信基督教，需要吃魚。"}, {"zh-tw": " So he went to Ray Kroc and he said, \"I'm going to bring you a fish sandwich,going to be made out of halibut.\" Ray Kroc said, \"I don't thinkit's going to work. I want to do a Hula Burger, and there's going to bea slice of pineapple on a bun.", "en": " 所以他去找Ray Kro，說： 「我要做一種魚肉堡，用大比目魚做。」 Ray Kroc就說：「我看不太好吧!」 「我想做一種呼拉漢堡， 在麵包上放一片菠蘿。"}, {"zh-tw": " But let's do this, let's have a bet. Whosever sandwich sells more,that will be the winning sandwich.\" Well, it's kind of sad for the oceanthat the Hula Burger didn't win.", "en": " 我們倆各做各的，打賭看誰贏。 誰的漢堡賣得多，誰的漢堡是冠軍漢堡。」 哎，呼拉漢堡最後沒有贏，對大海真是件悲傷的事，"}, {"zh-tw": " So he made his halibut sandwich. Unfortunately though,the sandwich came in at 30 cents.", "en": " 所以他就做了比目魚堡。 不過不妙的是，魚堡賣30美分一個，"}, {"zh-tw": " Ray wanted the sandwichto come in at 25 cents, so he turned to Atlantic cod. We all know what happened toAtlantic cod in New England.", "en": " Ray想要做到25美分。 所以他就去用大西洋鱈魚。 新英格蘭的大西洋鱈魚，不用說大家都知道。"}, {"zh-tw": " So now the Filet-O-Fish sandwichis made out of Alaska pollock, it's the largest fin fish fisheryin the United States, 2 to 3 billion pounds of fishtaken out of the sea every single year. If we go through the pollock, the next choice is probablygoing to be tilapia.", "en": " 所以如今的麥香魚堡用的是阿拉斯加黃線狹鱈， 它是美國捕撈量最大的魚類， 每年捕撈20到30億磅。 如果黃線狹鱈撈完了， 下一個選擇應該就是羅非魚。"}, {"zh-tw": " Tilapia is one of those fishnobody ever heard of 20 years ago. It's actually a very efficient converterof plant protein into animal protein, and it's been a godsendto the third world.", "en": " 羅非魚在20年前不出名， 但可以非常有效地將植物蛋白質轉為動物蛋白質， 羅非魚一直是第三世界的福音。"}, {"zh-tw": " It's actually a tremendouslysustainable solution, it goes from an eggto an adult in nine months. The problem is that when youlook about the West, it doesn't do what the Westwants it to do.", "en": " 它其實是一種極好的可持續發展解決方案， 它從卵成長為成魚只需九個月。 問題是從西方角度看， 羅非魚卻沒有西方想要的特點。"}, {"zh-tw": " It really doesn't have what's calledan oily fish profile. It doesn't have the EPA and DHA omega-3s that we all think are goingto make us live forever.", "en": " 羅非魚沒有所謂的“魚油”賣點。 也沒有EPA，DHA、omega-3不飽和脂肪酸， 這些我們覺得吃了可以長生不老的東西。"}, {"zh-tw": " So what do we do? I mean, first of all,what about this poor fish, the clupeids? The fish that represent a huge partof that 20 to 30 million metric tons. Well, one possibilitythat a lot of conservationists have raised is could we eat them? Could we eat them directlyinstead of feeding them to salmon? There are arguments for it.", "en": " 那我們該怎麼辦？ 首先來說，這種小魚怎麼樣，鯡魚？ 在上面提到的二、三千萬噸裡，這種魚占了很大比例。 許多保護主義者都提到這種可能性， 我們可以吃鯡魚嗎？ 我們可不可以直接吃它，而不是用來餵鮭魚？ 這有些爭論。"}, {"zh-tw": " They are tremendously fuel efficientto bring to market, a fraction of the fuel costof say, shrimp, and at the very topof the carbon efficiency scale. They also are omega-3 rich,a great source for EPA and DHA.", "en": " 鯡魚的燃油經濟性極高， 只佔蝦的燃油費用的冰山一角， 碳效率的排名也相當可觀。 鯡魚含豐富EPA、DHA、omega-3不飽和脂肪酸。"}, {"zh-tw": " So that is a potential. And if we were to go down that routewhat I would say is, instead of paying a few bucks a pound --or a few bucks a ton, really -- and making it into aquafeed, could we halve the catchand double the price for the fishermen and make that our wayof treating these particular fish? Other possibility though,which is much more interesting, is looking at bivalves,particularly mussels.", "en": " 所以鯡魚有潛力。 如果我們從這點說開來，我想說的是， 與其在每磅上支出幾美元--實際是每噸幾美元-- 用來把鯡魚變成魚飼料， 我們是不是可以將捕撈量減半，讓漁民的售價提升一倍， 以此作為我們對待這些魚類的做法嗎？ 另外一個選擇更有趣： 雙殼貝類，特別是貽貝。"}, {"zh-tw": " Now, mussels are very high in EPA and DHA,they're similar to canned tuna. They're also extremely fuel efficient.", "en": " 貽貝含豐富EPA和DHA，跟鮪魚罐頭相似。 貽貝的燃油經濟性也極高。"}, {"zh-tw": " To bring a pound of mussels to market is about a thirtieth of the carbonas required to bring beef to market. They require no forage fish, they actually get their omega-3sby filtering the water of microalgae.", "en": " 上市一磅貽貝的碳排放， 只有上市一磅牛肉的十三分之一。 它們也不用吃魚， 它們實際上可以過濾水中的藻類得到自己的omega-3不飽和脂肪酸。"}, {"zh-tw": " In fact, that's where omega-3s come from,they don't come from fish. Microalgae make the omega-3s,they're only bioconcentrated in fish.", "en": " 這其實是omega-3不飽和脂肪酸的來源，而不是魚。 omega-3不飽和脂肪酸由藻類製造，它們在魚類體內進行生物富集，"}, {"zh-tw": " Mussels and other bivalves do tremendous amounts of water filtration. A single mussel can filterdozens of gallons every single day.", "en": " 貽貝和其他雙殼類 能過濾大量的水。 一個貽貝每天可以過濾幾十加侖水。"}, {"zh-tw": " And this is incredibly importantwhen we look at the world. Right now, nitrification,overuse of phosphates in our waterways are causing tremendous algal blooms.", "en": " 這對地球的發展相當重要。 如今，水體中過量的氮和磷 使得藻類大量繁殖。"}, {"zh-tw": " Over 400 new dead zoneshave been created in the last 20 years, tremendous sources of marine life death. We also could look at not a fish at all.", "en": " 過去20年裡新形成的死水區有超過400個， 造成大量的海洋生物死亡。 我們還可以完全不考慮魚類，"}, {"zh-tw": " We could look at a vegetable. We could look at seaweed, the kelps, all these different varieties of thingsthat can be high in omega-3s, can be high in proteins, tremendously good things.", "en": " 我們可以考慮植物， 我們可以吃海帶，褐藻， 它們有許多不同品種，均富含ω-3不飽和脂肪酸， 富含蛋白質， 極好的優質食品。"}, {"zh-tw": " They filter the waterjust like mussels do. And weirdly enough, it turns out that youcan actually feed this to cows.", "en": " 這些植物可以像貽貝那樣過濾水。 而且信不信由你， 你還可以用海帶來餵牛。"}, {"zh-tw": " Now, I'm not a big fan of cattle. But if you wanted to keep growing cattle in a time and placewhere water resources are limited, you're growing seaweed in the water,you don't have to water it -- major consideration.", "en": " 我不是那麼喜歡吃牛。 但要是你想養牛， 但是養殖時間和地點不能提供很多水源， 你可以在水裡養海草，又不需要去澆水—— 這點很重要。"}, {"zh-tw": " And the last fish is a question mark. We have the abilityto create aquacultured fish that creates a net gainof marine protein for us.", "en": " 最後一種魚是一個問號。 我們現在有能力去創造一種水產養殖魚， 給我們帶來豐富海洋蛋白。"}, {"zh-tw": " This creature would have to be vegetarian, it would have to be fast growing, it would have to be adaptableto a changing climate and it would have to havethat oily fish profile, that EPA, DHA, omega-3fatty acid profile that we're looking for. This exists kind of on paper.", "en": " 這種魚要只吃植物， 又要生長得很快， 既要容易適應氣候變化， 又要有油性魚類的好處， 給我們帶來EPA、DHA、omega-3不飽和脂肪酸。 這似乎只存在於紙面上。"}, {"zh-tw": " I have been reportingon these subjects for 15 years. Every time I do a new story,somebody tells me, \"We can do all that.
