Sounds like fast food, doesn't it.", "en": " 而是設計來咀嚼 柔軟、糊狀 纖維量少 易咀嚼及 消化的食物 聽起來很像速食，不是嗎？ ."}, {"zh-tw": " It's for cooked food. We carry in our face the proof that cooking, food transformation, made us what we are.", "en": " 我們的牙齒是設計給烹煮過的食物 我們的臉，就是 烹煮 這個改變食物型態的技術 型塑了現代人外型的證據"}, {"zh-tw": " So I would suggest that we change how we classify ourselves. We talk about ourselves as omnivores.", "en": " 因此我建議我們改變我們原先的自我分類 我們總說人類是雜食性動物"}, {"zh-tw": " I would say, we should call ourselves coctivors -- from coquere, to cook.

Why is it always do and don'ts and it's good for you, it's not good for you?

Now, cooking allowed also that we became a migrant species.", "en": " 試想看看 這項被解放的人類潛能 便是因為烹煮與食物才有機會發展 為什麼我們如此關注食物 為什麼總要考慮吃或不吃 或是哪些食物對你有益、哪些有害? 我想對我來說好消息是 如果我們回頭想想 這項被釋放的潛能 以及它延續至今的各種影響 烹煮這項技術 曾使我們成為遷徙性的物種"}, {"zh-tw": " We walked out of Africa two times.

Reward: this is a more complex and especially integrative form of our brain with various different elements -- the external states, our internal states, how do we feel, and so on are put together.", "en": " 我們可將各種食材隨意組合 因為我們知道 透過烹煮，食物得以轉化成 更好吃、更營養的狀態 回饋：這一點更複雜 尤其是大腦在整合訊息 的狀態 跟各種因素： 外部環境、內在狀態 我們的感受及其他因素等等，加總的影響"}, {"zh-tw": " And something which maybe you don't like but you are so hungry that you really will be satisfied to eat. So satisfaction was a very important part.", "en": " 有些食物可能我們並不喜歡 但卻是餓到會心滿意足地吃下 所以滿足感是很重要的因素"}, {"zh-tw": " And as I say, energy was necessary. Now how did the gut actually participate in this development? And the gut is a silent voice -- it's going more for feelings.", "en": " 如同我所說的，能量則是必要的 而消化道是怎樣 參與烹煮技術發展？ 消化道無聲地發言 仰賴知覺來傳遞訊息"}, {"zh-tw": " I use the euphemism digestive comfort -- actually -- it's a digestive discomfort, which the gut is concerned with. If you get a stomach ache, if you get a little bit bloated, was not the right food, was not the right cooking manipulation or maybe other things went wrong.", "en": " 也就是消化時的舒適感 但實際上，消化不適的感覺 才是身體所關注的訊號 比如說如果你胃痛或是胃脹氣 你就知道哪些食物不該吃、不該那樣料理 或者你吃的食物哪些地方不對勁"}, {"zh-tw": " So my story is a tale of two brains, because it might surprise you, our gut has a full-fledged brain. All the managers in the room say, \"You don't tell me something new, because we know, gut feeling.", "en": " 所以我的故事是由兩個腦組成的 而這大概會讓你覺得驚訝 我們的消化道也有個獨立成熟的大腦 有些人也許會說： 「這又不是什麼新鮮事，因為我們知道腸胃感，就是直覺（gut feeling）"}, {"zh-tw": " This is what we are using.\" And actually you use it and it's actually useful. Because our gut is connected to our emotional limbic system, they do speak with each other and make decisions.", "en": " 這個詞我們天天都在用啊！」 . 我們的確都有使用消化道腦，它也的確是有用的 消化道與掌管情緒的邊緣系統互相連結 彼此互相溝通與傳遞訊息 並作出決定"}, {"zh-tw": " But what it means to have a brain there is that, not only the big brain has to talk with the food, the food has to talk with the brain, because we have to learn actually how to talk to the brains. Now if there's a gut brain, we should also learn to talk with this brain.", "en": " 我所指的 消化道中的腦 說明不只是大腦 會跟食物溝通 食物也必須要傳遞訊息給大腦 因此，我們必須要 學著跟大腦溝通 此外 我們也應該學著跟消化道腦溝通"}, {"zh-tw": " Now 150 years ago, anatomists described very, very carefully -- here is a model of a wall of a gut. I took the three elements -- stomach, small intestine and colon.", "en": " 大約一百五十年前 解剖學家便對消化道有了精準的描述 這是消化道管壁結構的示意圖 我列出了消化道的三個器官 胃、小腸、結腸"}, {"zh-tw": " And within this structure, you see these two pinkish layers, which are actually the muscle. And between this muscle, they found nervous tissues, a lot of nervous tissues, which penetrate actually the muscle -- penetrate the submucosa, where you have all the elements for the immune system.", "en": " 細看他們的結構 你可以看到兩層粉紅色的結構 這兩層是肌肉 而在肌肉中間，便存在著神經組織 許許多多的神經組織 這些神經穿過了肌肉 也穿過了黏膜下層 黏膜下層與免疫系統有關"}, {"zh-tw": " The gut is actually the largest immune system, defending your body. It penetrates the mucosa.", "en": " 消化道其實是人體最大的免疫系統 防衛你的身體 這些神經組織也穿透黏膜層"}, {"zh-tw": " This is the layer which actually touches the food you are swallowing and you digest, which is actually the lumen. Now if you think about the gut, the gut is -- if you could stretch it -- 40 meters long, the length of a tennis court.", "en": " 而此層直接與你所吃 以及所消化的食物接觸 也就是內腔 想像一下你的消化道 如果你拉開你的消化道 它會有四十公尺長 大約是網球場的長度"}, {"zh-tw": " If we could unroll it, get out all the folds and so on, it would have 400 sq. meters of surface. And now this brain takes care over this, to move it with the muscles and to do defend the surface and, of course, digest our food we cook.", "en": " 如果將它延展開 將其中的皺摺都展開 它的表面積大約有四百平方公尺 而這隱藏在消化道的腦 負責控制消化道肌肉的運作、保護消化道表面 當然，也消化烹煮過的食物"}, {"zh-tw": " So if we give you a specification, this brain, which is autonomous, have 500 million nerve cells, 100 million neurons -- so around the size of a cat brain, so there sleeps a little cat -- thinks for itself, optimizes whatever it digests. It has 20 different neuron types.", "en": " 容我詳細說明消化道腦 消化道腦具有自主性 有五億個神經細胞 一億個神經元 大約跟貓的腦一樣大 這裡可說是睡著一隻小貓呢! 消化道會自己思考 並將消化所得的能量妥善運用 它有二十種不同的神經元"}, {"zh-tw": " It's got the same diversity you find actually in a pig brain, where you have 100 billion neurons. It has autonomous organized microcircuits, has these programs which run.", "en": " 大約跟豬的腦一樣多樣化 但人類的消化道有一千億個神經元 而消化道有著自主的小型神經迴路 依照某些方式運行"}, {"zh-tw": " It senses the food; it knows exactly what to do. It senses it by chemical means and very importantly by mechanical means, because it has to move the food -- it has to mix all the various elements which we need for digestion.", "en": " 消化道可感受各種食物，並知道應該怎麼處理它們 藉著化學方式，還有 更重要的，力學的方式來感受食物 因為消化道必須要移動食團 並且混合其它消化所需的 各種元素"}, {"zh-tw": " This control of muscle is very, very important, because, you know, there can be reflexes. If you don't like a food, especially if you're a child, you gag.", "en": " 所以消化道肌肉的控制是非常非常重要的 如你所知， 如果不喜歡某種食物，特別是你年幼時，你會作嘔"}, {"zh-tw": " It's this brain which makes this reflex. And then finally, it controls also the secretion of this molecular machinery, which actually digests the food we cook.", "en": " 就是消化道腦負責這樣的反射動作 最後 消化道腦也控制著某些分子的分泌 這些分子是用來消化食物的"}, {"zh-tw": " Now how do the two brains work with each other? I took here a model from robotics -- it's called the Subsumption Architecture. What it means is that we have a layered control system.", "en": " 而腦與消化道中的腦彼此如何合作 在這用一個機械科學的模型來解釋 稱為「包容式體系結構」 指的是我們有著層級式的控制系統"}, {"zh-tw": " The lower layer, our gut brain, has its own goals -- digestion defense -- and we have the higher brain with the goal of integration and generating behaviors. Now both look -- and this is the blue arrows -- both look to the same food, which is in the lumen and in the area of your intestine.", "en": " 較低層級的消化道腦 有著自己的職責：消化及防禦 另外還有較高層級的腦 負責整合身體的各種訊息 並引發行為 看看藍色的箭頭 大腦與消化道腦都能感覺腸腔中的食物 也都感測著腸道中相同的區域"}, {"zh-tw": " The big brain integrates signals, which come from the running programs of the lower brain, But subsumption means that the higher brain can interfere with the lower. It can replace, or it can inhibit actually, signals.", "en": " 大腦整合這些訊息 而這些訊息其實是來自 消化道腦（綠色箭頭） 所謂的「包容式」，即 較高層級的腦可以影響較低層級的消化道腦 大腦可以取代 或者該說是抑制腸胃道的訊號（紅色箭頭）"}, {"zh-tw": " So if we take two types of signals -- a hunger signal for example. If you have an empty stomach, your stomach produces a hormone called ghrelin.", "en": " 我用飢餓跟飽足感來說明 比方說，飢餓的訊號 如果你肚子空空 你的胃便會產生一種叫作飢餓素（ghrelin）的賀爾蒙"}, {"zh-tw": " It's a very big signal; it's sent to the brain says, \"Go and eat.\" You have stop signals -- we have up to eight stop signals. At least in my case, they are not listened to.", "en": " 它是一種很強烈的訊號 會被傳送至大腦並且對大腦說 「快去吃點東西!！」 但身體裡也存在著停止的訊號 我們有多達八種的停止訊號 不過對我來說 這些抑制訊號通常不太管用 ."}, {"zh-tw": " So what happens if the big brain in the integration overrides the signal? So if you override the hunger signal, you can have a disorder, which is called anorexia. Despite generating a healthy hunger signal, the big brain ignores it and activates different programs in the gut.", "en": " 若大腦整合後的訊號 凌駕來自消化道的訊號 會如何呢？ 比如說大腦不理會飢餓的訊息 會產生叫作精神性厭食的症狀 雖然消化道產生了 健康的飢餓訊號 大腦仍然忽略這樣的訊息 並且啟動消化道的其他機制"}, {"zh-tw": " The more usual case is overeating. It actually takes the signal and changes it, and we continue, even [though] our eight signals would say, \"Stop, enough.", "en": " 不過更常見的例子是 吃得太飽 大腦接收到飽的訊息 卻改變它 讓我們繼續吃 雖然有八種訊號會說：「夠了！別吃了！"}, {"zh-tw": " We have transferred enough energy.\" Now the interesting thing is that, along this lower layer -- this gut -- the signal becomes stronger and stronger if undigested, but digestible, material could penetrate. This we found from bariatric surgery.", "en": " 身體已經獲得足夠的能量了！」 有趣的是 觀察接受減重手術病人會發現 在較低層級的消化道中 在未消化但可消化的食物 通過時 這些飽足感的訊號會越變越強"}, {"zh-tw": " That then the signal would be very, very high. So now back to the cooking question and back to the design.", "en": " 飽足感的訊號會非常、非常的高 現在，回到烹煮這項主題 以及如何將它設計的更盡善盡美"}, {"zh-tw": " We have learned to talk to the big brain -- taste and reward, as you know. Now what would be the language we have to talk to the gut brain that its signals are so strong that the big brain cannot ignore it? Then we would generate something all of us would like to have -- a balance between the hunger and the satiation.", "en": " 我們已經知道如何跟大腦溝通 也就是透過味覺及回饋 但是我們應該用什麼樣的語言 來跟消化道腦溝通呢？ 如何才能產生強烈到讓 大腦無法忽略的飽足訊號呢？ 這樣我們就能 如大家所願的 在飢餓 與飽足之間取得巧妙的平衡"}, {"zh-tw": " Now I give you, from our research, a very short claim. This is fat digestion.", "en": " 從我們的研究中可看出一點端倪 這是一個脂肪消化的實驗"}, {"zh-tw": " You have on your left an olive oil droplet, and this olive oil droplet gets attacked by enzymes. This is an in vitro experiment.", "en": " 在左邊的是 橄欖油的油滴 我們以酵素來分解這些油滴 這是一個體外的實驗"}, {"zh-tw": " It's very difficult to work in the intestine. Now everyone would expect that when the degradation of the oil happens, when the constituents are liberated, they disappear, they go away because they [were] absorbed.", "en": " 因為很難在腸道中進行這樣的實驗 每個人都料想得到 油滴會被分解 油滴裡面的成分會被釋放出來 然後油滴就消失了 因為它們會被吸收掉"}, {"zh-tw": " Actually, what happens is that a very intricate structure appears. And I hope you can see that there are some ring-like structures in the middle image, which is water.", "en": " 實際上，在消化過程中會產生一種很精巧的結構 希望大家可以看得清楚 在中間的圖片，有一圈環狀的構造 這是水"}, {"zh-tw": " This whole system generates a huge surface to allow more enzymes to attack the remaining oil. And finally, on your right side, you see a bubbly, cell-like structure appearing, from which the body will absorb the fat.", "en": " 這樣的構造會創造出一個很大的表面積 使得更多的消化酵素 可以來攻擊、分解這些油滴 最後，在右邊的圖片 你可以看到泡狀、 類細胞的結構產生 身體就是從這些結構吸收油脂"}, {"zh-tw": " Now if we could take this language -- and this is a language of structures -- and make it longer-lasting, that it can go through the passage of the intestine, it would generate stronger signals. So our research -- and I think the research also at the universities -- are now fixing on these points to say: how can we actually -- and this might sound trivial now to you -- how can we change cooking? How can we cook that we have this language developed? So what we have actually, it's not an omnivore's dilemma.", "en": " 現在如果我們讓這樣的語言 這種結構的語言 更持久 讓飽足感的訊號 穿過整個腸道 它就能夠產生更強烈的抑制訊號 所以我們的研究 以及其他的研究都指出 問題其實是指向 我們該怎樣─ 這對你來說可能無關緊要─ 改變我們烹煮食物的方式 我們要如何烹煮 讓食物表達出這些結構語言？ 所以實際上我們面對的，並不是雜食性動物的難題"}, {"zh-tw": " We have a coctivor's opportunity, because we have learned over the last two million years which taste and reward -- quite sophisticated to cook -- to please ourselves, to satisfy ourselves. If we add the matrix, if we add the structure language, which we have to learn, when we learn it, then we can put it back; and around energy, we could generate a balance, which comes out from our really primordial operation: cooking.", "en": " 相反的，我們有的是熟食性動物的契機 因為我們已經從過去兩百萬年的經驗中學到 藉著味覺以及回饋 來設計精巧的飲食 來滿足、取悅我們自己 故我們在飲食鐵三角中加入食物基質 將這些得去了解的食物結構語言納入考量 當我們習得這些知識，就能讓結構語言 成為圍繞著能量的第三個角 我們就可以透過 我們最基本的技術，也就是烹煮 在味覺、回饋、能量之間取得平衡"}, {"zh-tw": " So, to make cooking really a very important element, I would say even philosophers have to change and have to finally recognize that cooking is what made us. So I would say, coquo ergo sum: I cook, therefore I am.", "en": " 而要使烹煮這件事 成為很重要的元素 我想連哲學家都必須要改變 並且體認到 烹煮這項技術才是使我們之所以為我們的原因 因此，我想說：coquo ergo sum (拉丁語) 我煮故我在！"}, {"zh-tw": " Thank you very much.", "en": " 謝謝大家 ."}], "title": "Heribert Watzke The Brain In Your Gut"}
