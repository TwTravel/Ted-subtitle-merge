We are a small fishing tribe situated on the southeastern tip of Long Island near the town of Southampton in New York.", "en": " 一切事物都是相互關聯的 作為一個辛奈考克印第安人我從小就知道這點 我們是個小漁村部落 位於長島的東南端 在紐約附近的南安普敦鎮"}, {"zh-tw": " When I was a little girl, my grandfather took me to sit outside in the sun on a hot summer day. There were no clouds in the sky.", "en": " 當我還是個小女孩 爺爺帶我坐在夏季的炎熱太陽下 天空沒有半片雲彩"}, {"zh-tw": " And after a while I began to perspire. And he pointed up to the sky, and he said, \"Look, do you see that? That's part of you up there.", "en": " 不一會兒，我開始出汗 爺爺指向天空說： 「你看到了嗎？ 那是你的一部分，"}, {"zh-tw": " That's your water that helps to make the cloud that becomes the rain that feeds the plants that feeds the animals.\" In my continued exploration of subjects in nature that have the ability to illustrate the interconnection of all life, I started storm chasing in 2008 after my daughter said, \"Mom, you should do that.\" And so three days later, driving very fast, I found myself stalking a single type of giant cloud called the super cell, capable of producing grapefruit-size hail and spectacular tornadoes, although only two percent actually do. These clouds can grow so big, up to 50 miles wide and reach up to 65,000 feet into the atmosphere.", "en": " 你身體的水，幫助雲的產生， 雲再變成雨，滋養植物， 植物再餵養動物。」 在我持續探索自然的主題中 顯示一切生命都是相互關聯的 2008 年我開始追逐風暴 因為我女兒說：「媽媽，你應該去做。」 三天後，我高速開車 發現自己正接近一種巨大的雲稱為「超級細胞」 它能產生葡萄柚大小的冰雹、 及壯觀的龍捲風 雖然這只有百分之二的機會 雲能大到寬達八十公里 高度可達兩萬公尺"}, {"zh-tw": " They can grow so big, blocking all daylight, making it very dark and ominous standing under them. Storm chasing is a very tactile experience.", "en": " 大到能遮蔽所有日光 站在下方感到非常黑暗與不祥 追風是個非常有感覺的經驗"}, {"zh-tw": " There's a warm, moist wind blowing at your back and the smell of the earth, the wheat, the grass, the charged particles.

My hair used to be straight.", "en": " 我學會了尊重閃電 以前我的頭髮是直的"}, {"zh-tw": " I'm just kidding. What really excites me about these storms is their movement, the way they swirl and spin and undulate, with their lava lamp-like mammatus clouds.", "en": " 開玩笑的啦 真正讓我興奮的，是這些風暴的 移動、漩渦、旋轉、起伏 以及像熔岩燈的—乳房狀積雨雲"}, {"zh-tw": " They become lovely monsters. When I'm photographing them, I cannot help but remember my grandfather's lesson.", "en": " 它們是可愛的怪物 當我拍攝風暴時 不禁想起爺爺的教訓"}, {"zh-tw": " As I stand under them, I see not just a cloud, but understand that what I have the privilege to witness is the same forces, the same process in a small-scale version that helped to create our galaxy, our solar system, our sun and even this very planet.
