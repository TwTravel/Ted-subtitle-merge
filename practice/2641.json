There's love and there's friendshipand there's protection.", "en": " 親人間，有很多故事。 有愛、有友誼、有保護。"}, {"zh-tw": " But there's also jealousy and competition and rejection and attack. In siblinghood, that's where we startassembling many of those first layers that cover our soul.", "en": " 但也有嫉妒 和競爭 拒絕和攻擊。 在親人關係中，我們開始組成靈魂的層次， 這是覆蓋我們靈魂第一層的地方。"}, {"zh-tw": " When I discovered I was my sister's match, I went into research mode. And I discovered that the premise of transplantsis pretty straightforward.", "en": " 當我知道我是我妹妹的最佳配型時， 我進入了研究模式。 而我發現 移植的原理是很直截了當的。"}, {"zh-tw": " You destroy all the bone marrowin the cancer patient with massive doses of chemotherapy, and then you replace that marrow with several million healthymarrow cells from a donor.

Attack.", "en": " 他們稱之為排斥或攻擊， 這兩種狀況都可能致死。 拒絕，攻擊。"}, {"zh-tw": " Those words had a familiar ring in the context of being siblings. My sister and I hada long history of love, but we also had a long historyof rejection and attack, from minor misunderstandingsto bigger betrayals.", "en": " 這些字眼，在親人圈裡， 是相當司空見慣的。 我妹和我有一段很長的友愛歷史， 但我們也有長期互看不爽和攻擊對方的歷史， 從小小的誤解到重大的背叛。"}, {"zh-tw": " We didn't havethe kind of the relationship where we talked about the deeper stuff; but, like many siblings and like peoplein all kinds of relationships, we were hesitant to tell our truths, to reveal our wounds, to admit our wrongdoings. But when I learned aboutthe dangers of rejection or attack, I thought, it's time to change this.", "en": " 我們當時根本談不上甚麼 更深層的東西； 但，就像很多親人和其他處與各種關係的人們一樣， 彼此之間不好意思說出實話、 很難互相傾訴痛苦、 不願承認犯過的錯誤。 但當我了解拒絕或攻擊的危險時， 我在想，是時候要改變了。"}, {"zh-tw": " What if we left the bone marrowtransplant up to the doctors, but did something that we later cameto call our \"soul marrow transplant?\" What if we faced any painwe had caused each other, and instead of rejection or attack, could we listen? Could we forgive? Could we merge? Would that teach our cells to do the same? To woo my skeptical sister,I turned to my parents' holy text: the New Yorker Magazine. I sent her a cartoon from its pages as a way of explainingwhy we should visit a therapist before having my bone marrow harvestedand transplanted into her body.", "en": " 要是我們就讓醫生做骨髓移植手術， 我們彼此做「靈魂的骨髓移植手術」？ 要是我們可以坦然面對造成對方受傷的事情， 而不是拒絕或攻擊， 我們可以互相傾聽嗎？ 我們可以原諒彼此嗎？ 我們可以再度結合嗎？ 這可以讓我們的細胞也做同樣的事嗎？ 為了博取瘦骨如柴妹妹的歡心，我找上了爸媽拜讀的聖經： 《紐約人雜誌》 我傳送了一張裡面的照片給她， 在收成並移植我的骨髓到她身體裡面之前， 解釋了一下我們為什麼要去找醫生治療。"}, {"zh-tw": " Here it is. \"I have never forgiven him for that thingI made up in my head.\" I told my sister we had probably been doing the same thing, carting around made-up storiesin our heads that kept us separate.", "en": " 就是這一張。 我永遠不會原諒他那件我自己腦袋瞎掰出來的事。 我告訴我的妹妹 我們可能彼此做了同樣的事情， 腦海陷入在虛構故事的泥沼裡，讓彼此斷絕關係。"}, {"zh-tw": " And I told her that after the transplant, all of the blood flowing in her veins would be my blood, made from my marrow cells, and that inside the nucleusof each of those cells is a complete set of my DNA. \"I will be swimming around in youfor the rest of your life,\" I told my slightly horrified sister.", "en": " 我告訴她骨髓移植之後， 所有流動在她靜脈的血液 將會是從我的骨髓細胞中 製造出來的血， 而這些細胞裡的細胞核 都是由我的 DNA 所組成。 我向我那有點嚇壞的妹妹說， 「在你的餘生，我會在你體內游來游去」。"}, {"zh-tw": " \"I think we better clean upour relationship.\" A health crisis makes peopledo all sorts of risky things, like quitting a jobor jumping out of an airplane and, in the case of my sister, saying \"yes\" to several therapy sessions, during which we got down to the marrow. We looked at and released years of stories and assumptions about each other and blame and shame until all that was left was love.", "en": " 我想我們最好整理一下我們的關係。 嚴重的健康問題，可以讓人做出任何冒險的決定， 像是辭職或是從飛機上跳下來， 而以我妹妹的案例而言， 她在骨髓移植期間的 一些治療階段，只能說「好」。 我們回顧並互相坦白這幾年來發生的事、 彼此間的臆測、責備、 羞辱， 直到剩下愛。"}, {"zh-tw": " People have said I was braveto undergo the bone marrow harvest, but I don't think so. What felt brave to me was that other kindof harvest and transplant, the soul marrow transplant, getting emotionally nakedwith another human being, putting aside pride and defensiveness, lifting the layers and sharing with each otherour vulnerable souls.", "en": " 大家說我很勇敢，有勇氣去動骨髓移植的手術， 但我不這麼認為。 讓我有勇氣的是 另一種移植， 一種與另一個人坦白彼此情感的 靈魂骨髓移植， 一種放下自尊心和防禦心， 昇華到另一種層次的移植， 我們分享彼此脆弱的靈魂。"}, {"zh-tw": " I called on those midwife lessons: uncover your soul. Open to what's scary and painful.", "en": " 我回顧了從助產士所學到的這些課程： 敞開你的靈魂。 對害怕與痛苦保持樂觀開放。"}, {"zh-tw": " Look for the sacred awe. Here I am with my marrow cellsafter the harvest.", "en": " 尋找神聖的敬畏。 移植之後，我跟我的骨髓細胞拍了張照片。"}, {"zh-tw": " That's they call it -- \"harvest,\" like it's some kind of bucolicfarm-to-table event -- Which I can assure you it is not. And here is my brave, brave sister receiving my cells.", "en": " 他們說，這是收成， 有點像把田園菜端上桌的過程—— 但我可以向各位保證，並不是那樣。 這張是我勇敢的妹妹， 接收我細胞時的照片。"}, {"zh-tw": " After the transplant, we began to spendmore and more time together.

I was paid in soul.", "en": " 我是用愛支付的， 我是用靈魂支付的，"}, {"zh-tw": " I was paid in my sister. My sister said the year after transplantwas the best year of her life, which was surprising.", "en": " 我是用我妹支付的。 我妹說，在移植後的那一年，是她生命中最棒的一年， 她相當開心。"}, {"zh-tw": " She suffered so much. But she said life never tasted as sweet, and that because of the soul-baring and the truth-tellingwe had done with each other, she became more unapologetically herself with everyone.", "en": " 她這麼痛苦。 但她說，生活再也不會那樣的甜蜜， 因為我們彼此 敞開靈魂說實話， 她面對每個人時， 變得很自責。"}, {"zh-tw": " She said thingsshe'd always needed to say.

I became braver about being authenticwith the people in my life.", "en": " 我也一樣。 我在面對生命中的人們時，變得更加勇敢真誠。"}, {"zh-tw": " I said my truths, but more important than that,I sought the truth of others. It wasn't untilthe final chapter of this story that I realized just how wellmidwifery had trained me.", "en": " 我說出了我的真理， 但更重要的是，我也找到了別人的真理。 直到這個故事的最後一章， 我才了解到助產士把我教地多好。"}, {"zh-tw": " After that best year of my sister's life, the cancer came roaring back, and this time there was nothing morethe doctors could do. They gave her justa couple of months to live.", "en": " 在度過了我妹妹人生中最棒的那一年後， 癌症再度復發， 這一回，醫生們也沒轍了， 他們告訴她，她剩下幾個月的時間可活。"}, {"zh-tw": " The night before my sister died, I sat by her bedside.

It was my blood, her blood, our blood.", "en": " 我看著她脖子上血的脈動， 流的是我的血、她的血、我們的血。"}, {"zh-tw": " When she died, part of me would die, too. I tried to make sense of it all, how becoming one with each other had made us more ourselves, our soul selves, and how by facing and openingto the pain of our past, we'd finally been delivered to each other, and how by stepping out of time, we would now be connected forever.", "en": " 當她死了，我生命中的一部分也死了。 我嘗試地去了解整個道理， 如何讓大家融為一體， 讓我們成為真正的自己， 擁有真誠的靈魂， 如何面對並敞開我們過去的痛苦， 讓我們彼此最終能解脫， 如何跳脫時間的限制， 讓我們永遠地連結在一起。"}, {"zh-tw": " My sister left me with so many things, and I'm going to leave you nowwith just one of them.
