Although they very carefully preserved the stomach, the lungs, the liver, and so forth, they just mushed up the brain,drained it out through the nose, and threw it away, which makes sense, really, because what does a braindo for us anyway? But imagine if there were a kindof neglected organ in our bodies that weighed just as much as the brain and in some ways was justas important to who we are, but we knew so little aboutand treated with such disregard.", "en": " 以此為例。 古埃及人會謹慎處理胃、肺 肝等器官， 但對於頭部，他們只會沖洗鼻腔， 然後就隨便處理掉了， 這樣的作法合理的， 想想大腦對我們的幫助為何就知道了？ 但試想如果我們所忽視的一個體內器官 它的重量恰巧和大腦相同 決定我們會成為怎樣的人， 但因為我們的無知而被打入冷宮。"}, {"zh-tw": " And imagine if,through new scientific advances, we were just beginning to understand its importance to howwe think of ourselves. Wouldn't you want to know more about it? Well, it turns out that we dohave something just like that: our gut, or rather, its microbes.", "en": " 再試想，如果隨著科技的不斷進步 我們開始注意到 原來它對我們如此重要。 你還會繼續對它視而不見嗎？ 我想，接下來你可能會： 開始關注我們的腸道 或更多東西，比如腸道中的微生物。"}, {"zh-tw": " But it's not just the microbesin our gut that are important. Microbes all over our body turn out to be really criticalto a whole range of differences that make different people who we are.", "en": " 當然不是只有腸道中的微生物值得關注。 它無處不在，遊走于我們體內， 是造成人體差異， 形成不同個體的關鍵因素。"}, {"zh-tw": " So for example, have you ever noticed how some people get bitten by mosquitosway more often than others? It turns out that everyone's anecdotalexperience out camping is actually true. For example, I seldomget bitten by mosquitos, but my partner Amandaattracts them in droves, and the reason why is that we havedifferent microbes on our skin that produce different chemicalsthat the mosquitos detect.", "en": " 舉例來說，你有沒有發現 有些人就是特別容易被蚊蟲叮？ 事實上每個人的露營經驗談都沒有造假。 拿我來說，蚊子很少叮我， 但我的太太阿曼達是牠們的最愛， 原因就是我倆表皮上的微生物形成了 不同的化學物質，導致蚊蟲的反應不同。"}, {"zh-tw": " Now, microbes are also really importantin the field of medicine. So, for example, what microbesyou have in your gut determine whether particular painkillersare toxic to your liver.", "en": " 目前，微生物對醫療也發揮著重要作用。 比如，腸道中的微生物能判斷 某些止痛劑對肝臟是否有毒副作用。"}, {"zh-tw": " They also determine whether or not otherdrugs will work for your heart condition. And, if you're a fruit fly, at least, your microbes determinewho you want to have sex with.", "en": " 它們還能判斷其它藥物是否會影響你的心臟功能。 如果你是只果蠅，微生物至少 能決定你嚮往的交配對象。"}, {"zh-tw": " We haven't demonstrated this in humans yet but maybe it's just a matter of timebefore we find out.

So when we take them together,they look like this.", "en": " 所以，既然無法從視覺上區分他們， 那麼我們只能從基因序列來辨別， 在一項名為人類微生物組項目的計劃中， NTH 投資了 17300 萬美元， 同時該項目還吸引到了數百位研究人員 為的是弄清所有A's、 T's、 G's和C's 以及人體內所有微生物的排列組合。 結果我們看到了這樣一幅景象。"}, {"zh-tw": " It's a bit more difficultto tell who lives where now, isn't it? What my lab does is developcomputational techniques that allow us to take all these terabytesof sequence data and turn them into somethingthat's a bit more useful as a map, and so when we do thatwith the human microbiome data from 250 healthy volunteers, it looks like this. Each point here representsall the complex microbes in an entire microbial community.", "en": " 這樣你很難看出它們的具體位置，對嗎？ 我的實驗室為此開發了一種計算技術 可將序列數據取值到兆兆字節 同時排列組合成可用性更高的圖譜樣式， 所以如果我們將250名健康的志願受試者 體內的微生物數據代入其中， 會顯示這樣的圖譜。 這其中的每個點都代表整個 微生物群落中各個複雜的微生物。"}, {"zh-tw": " See, I told you they basicallyall look the same. So what we're looking at is each pointrepresents one microbial community from one body siteof one healthy volunteer.", "en": " 就像我說的，它們的樣子都差不多。 所以我們的觀察重點是每個點是代表一位健康 志願受試者的某個軀體部位的一個微生物群落。"}, {"zh-tw": " And so you can see that there's differentparts of the map in different colors, almost like separate continents. And what it turns out to be is that those, as the differentregions of the body, have very different microbes in them.", "en": " 我們像區分大陸板塊一樣，用不同顏色 在圖譜中標識不同部位。 由此可以發現 在軀體不同區域 會聚集不同的微生物。"}, {"zh-tw": " So what we have is we havethe oral community up there in green. Over on the other side,we have the skin community in blue, the vaginal community in purple, and then right down at the bottom,we have the fecal community in brown.", "en": " 現在我們看到的綠色群落是口腔微生物群落。 在另一邊藍色的群落是肌膚的微生物群落， 紫色的是陰道微生物群落， 而在右下方棕色的是肛腸區的微生物群落。"}, {"zh-tw": " And we've just over the last few years found out that the microbesin different parts of the body are amazingly different from one another.

So this is incrediblewhen you think about it.", "en": " 人體中微生物群落的差異比 暗礁和草原微生物群落的差異更大。 細想真是不可思議。"}, {"zh-tw": " What it means is that a few feetof difference in the human body makes more of a differenceto your microbial ecology than hundreds of miles on Earth. And this is not to say that two people look basically the same in the same body habitat, either.", "en": " 這表示如果從微生物生態學來看， 人體中微生物存在的些許差異 轉變為地球生態，其差異可以是天差地別的。 也就是說，兩個看似相同的人 未必有相同的體內環境。"}, {"zh-tw": " So you probably heard that we're pretty much all the samein terms of our human DNA. You're 99.99 percent identicalin terms of your human DNA to the person sitting next to you.", "en": " 你可能聽過這樣的說法 如果從人類的 DNA 來看，每個人都幾近相同。 以 DNA 來說，你和 隔壁的人相似度可達 99.99%。"}, {"zh-tw": " But that's not true of your gut microbes: you might only share 10 percent similarity with the person sitting next to youin terms of your gut microbes. So that's as differentas the bacteria on this prairie and the bacteria in this forest.", "en": " 但是說道腸道微生物就不一樣了： 從腸道微生物的角度來看， 相鄰兩人的相似度可能僅有10%。 這就好比草原中存活的細菌 不同於森林中存活的細菌。"}, {"zh-tw": " So these different microbes have all these different kinds of functions that I told you about, everything from digesting food to involvementin different kinds of diseases, metabolizing drugs, and so forth. So how do they do all this stuff? Well, in part it's because although there's just three poundsof those microbes in our gut, they really outnumber us.", "en": " 如同我之前提到的，正是這些各不相同的微生物 在人體中產生了不同的功用， 從消化食物 到影響各類病症、 代謝藥物等等。 那麼微生物是如何集結成群，發揮作用的？ 一方面是因為， 這些僅重三磅的腸道衛生物 其實際數目卻是驚人的。"}, {"zh-tw": " And so how much do they outnumber us? Well, it depends on whatyou think of as our bodies. Is it our cells? Well, each of us consistsof about 10 trillion human cells, but we harbor as manyas 100 trillion microbial cells.", "en": " 你問數目有多驚人？ 這取決於你怎麼看待人體。 如果你支持細胞論？ 那麼每個人都是由約10萬億個人體細胞組成的， 而我們體內存有的微生物細胞達100萬億個。"}, {"zh-tw": " So they outnumber us 10 to one. Now, you might think, well,we're human because of our DNA, but it turns out that each of us hasabout 20,000 human genes, depending on what you count exactly, but as many as two millionto 20 million microbial genes.", "en": " 也就是說相當於10個我們。 當然，如果你推崇DNA的概念， 那麼目前已知的確切數字是， 我們體內的遺傳因子約為20,000個， 而微生物基因的數量可達200萬至2000萬個。"}, {"zh-tw": " So whichever way we look at it,we're vastly outnumbered by our microbial symbionts. And it turns out that in addition to traces of our human DNA, we also leave tracesof our microbial DNA on everything we touch.", "en": " 所以無論是支持哪種理論， 我們都是由無數的微生物共生體組成的。 所以我們不但要研究人類的DNA， 我們所接觸對象的 微生物DNA也是有待挖掘的領域。"}, {"zh-tw": " We showed in a study a few years ago that you can actually matchthe palm of someone's hand up to the computer mousethat they use routinely with up to 95 percent accuracy. So this came out in a scientific journala few years ago, but more importantly,it was featured on \"CSI: Miami,\" so you really know it's true.", "en": " 我們在過去幾年進行的研究顯示， 如將某人留在常用鼠標上的物質 與其本身的掌紋相比較， 其匹配率可高達95%。 數年前曾有科學雜誌報道過這項發現， 不過美國影集“CSI：邁阿密系列”令它街知巷聞， 可見這不是編劇杜撰的。 （大笑）"}, {"zh-tw": " So where do our microbescome from in the first place? Well if, as I do, you have dogs or kids, you probably havesome dark suspicions about that, all of which are true, by the way. So just like we can matchyou to your computer equipment by the microbes you share, we can also match you up to your dog.", "en": " 那麼微生物從何而來？ 像我一樣，如果你有養狗或小孩， 可能難免會對此產生些邪惡的疑慮， 順便一提，這都說得通。 正如我們可以將你留在計算機設備上的 的微生物與本體作比較， 同樣的結果也可以印證在狗的身上。"}, {"zh-tw": " But it turns out that in adults, microbial communitiesare relatively stable, so even if you live together with someone, you'll maintain your separatemicrobial identity over a period of weeks,months, even years. It turns out that ourfirst microbial communities depend a lot on how we're born.", "en": " 結果我們發現，成人的微生物群落 相對穩定。 所以即使你和某人生活在一起， 仍可維持數週、數月、甚至數年 你獨有的微生物特性。 也就是說我們最初的微生物群落 取決於我們的出生環境。"}, {"zh-tw": " So babies that come outthe regular way, all of their microbes are basicallylike the vaginal community, whereas babies that aredelivered by C-section, all of their microbes insteadlook like skin. And this might be associatedwith some of the differences in health associated with Cesarean birth, such as more asthma, more allergies,even more obesity, all of which have been linkedto microbes now, and when you think about it,until recently, every surviving mammal had been delivered by the birth canal, and so the lackof those protective microbes that we've co-evolved withmight be really important for a lot of these different conditionsthat we now know involve the microbiome.", "en": " 所以，對於順產的寶寶 他們的微生物特性通常更接近於陰道部位的群落特征， 而剖腹產的寶寶， 其微生物特性更接近于肌膚的微生物群落。 而這種差異也可能被認為與 剖腹產寶寶的體質健康有關聯， 比如目前就有較多人認為微生物可能 與哮喘、過敏甚至是肥胖症有關， 基於這一點，反觀直至目前， 每個經產道分娩的哺乳動物， 以及所缺少的、 共同進化、起保護作用的微生物， 可能正是催生出不同微生物學條件的重要因素。"}, {"zh-tw": " When my own daughter was borna couple of years ago by emergency C-section, we took matters into our own hands and made sure she was coatedwith those vaginal microbes that she would have gotten naturally. Now, it's really difficult to tellwhether this has had an effect on her health specifically, right? With a sample size of just one child,no matter how much we love her, you don't really haveenough of a sample size to figure out what happens on average, but at two years old,she hasn't had an ear infection yet, so we're keeping our fingerscrossed on that one.", "en": " 幾年前我太太在緊急情況下 剖腹產下我的女兒， 我們只能自食其力 後天給予女兒如同順產般 可受到的陰道微生物群的保護。 目前，我們尚無法判斷 這對她的健康是否有用，不是嗎？ 我們的觀察樣本只有一個孩子，無論我們多愛她， 我們還是缺少足夠的觀察樣本， 推斷出平均水平， 直到她兩歲時，尚未患支氣管炎， 為此我們也一直祈禱她健康。"}, {"zh-tw": " And what's more, we're startingto do clinical trials with more children to figure out whetherthis has a protective effect generally. So how we're born has a tremendous effecton what microbes we have initially, but where do we go after that? What I'm showing youagain here is this map of the Human Microbiome Project Data, so each point representsa sample from one body site from one of 250 healthy adults.", "en": " 同時我們也開始通過臨床試驗觀察其他孩子， 藉此判斷這種微生物是否能起到一般保護作用。 可見分娩方式不同，初生時體內微生物的不同， 其影響也是巨大的，那麼接下來我們該做什麼？ 這裡我將再次出示這張 人體微生物項目數據圖譜， 圖譜中的每個點都代表 250 位健康成年人 各個身體部位的取樣結果。"}, {"zh-tw": " And you've seen childrendevelop physically. You've seen them develop mentally.", "en": " 各位已經熟悉兒童的生理發育， 也瞭解他們的心理成長，"}, {"zh-tw": " Now, for the first time,you're going to see one of my colleague's childrendevelop microbially. So what we are going to look at is we're going to look at this one baby's stool, the fecal community,which represents the gut, sampled every weekfor almost two and a half years.", "en": " 現在，你們將首次見證 我同事的一個孩子在微生物意義上的蛻變。 我們接下來要觀察的對象 就是這個孩子的“粑粑”, 即代表腸道的糞便菌落， 我們每週採樣，持續近兩年半時間。"}, {"zh-tw": " And so we're starting on day one. What's going to happen is that the infantis going to start off as this yellow dot, and you can see that he's starting offbasically in the vaginal community, as we would expect from his delivery mode.", "en": " 我們從第一天開始觀察， 這個黃球的運動軌跡就是嬰兒的微生物發育過程， 它基本上從陰道菌落開始出發， 這也符合孩子的分娩方式。"}, {"zh-tw": " And what's going to happenover these two and a half years is that he's going to travel all the way down to resemble the adult fecal community fromhealthy volunteers down at the bottom. So I'm just going to start this goingand we'll see how that happens.", "en": " 在兩年半的時間裡， 它由上而下運動， 最終與底部的健康志願者糞便菌落相吻合。 我們來看這一運動過程是怎樣的。"}, {"zh-tw": " What you can see, and remembereach step in this is just one week, what you can see is that week to week, the change in the microbial communityof the feces of this one child, the differences week to weekare much greater than the differences betweenindividual healthy adults in the Human Microbiome Project cohort, which are those brown dotsdown at the bottom. And you can see he's startingto approach the adult fecal community.", "en": " 請注意，黃球的每一步移動都歷時一周， 大家可以看到這個孩子 糞便微生物菌落的每週變化情況， 這種變化遠遠超出了 人類微生物菌落專案對列中 健康成人個體之間的差異。 底部的褐色球表示成人個體的微生物菌落。 我們可以看到，它正開始接近成人糞便菌落。"}, {"zh-tw": " This is up to about two years. But something amazingis about to happen here.", "en": " 此時已過去了近兩年時間。 但一場“奇跡”即將在這裡上演。"}, {"zh-tw": " So he's getting antibioticsfor an ear infection. What you can see isthis huge change in the community, followed by a relatively rapid recovery.", "en": " 孩子因為耳部感染而服用了抗生素， 這導致其微生物菌落發生巨變， 接著是相對快速的修復。"}, {"zh-tw": " I'll just rewind that for you. And what we can see is thatjust over these few weeks, we have a much more radical change, a setback of many months of normal development, followed by a relatively rapid recovery, and by the time he reaches day 838, which is the end of this video, you can see that he has essentiallyreached the healthy adult stool community, despite that antibiotic intervention.", "en": " 我們再來看一遍。 經過短短幾周時間， 我們發現微生物菌落的變化越來越大， 拖累了孩子數個月的正常發育， 接下來是相對快速的修復， 等到第838天， 也就是這段影片的結尾處， 我們可以清楚地看到，儘管有抗生素的干預， 孩子的糞便菌落已經與健康成人相差無幾。"}, {"zh-tw": " So this is really interestingbecause it raises fundamental questions about what happens when we interveneat different ages in a child's life. So does what we do early on, wherethe microbiome is changing so rapidly, actually matter, or is it like throwing a stoneinto a stormy sea, where the ripples will just be lost? Well, fascinatingly, it turns outthat if you give children antibiotics in the first six months of life, they're more likelyto become obese later on than if they don't get antibiotics thenor only get them later, and so what we do early onmay have profound impacts on the gut microbial communityand on later health that we're only beginning to understand.", "en": " 這個過程非常有趣， 它暗示了對不同年齡段的兒童進行干預會引發某些問題。 微生物的變化是如此之快， 是否意味著我們早期的干預行為， 就像在風大浪急的海面投入一粒石子， 泛不起絲毫漣漪？ 結果，我們卻驚奇地發現， 如果兒童在出生後六個月內服用抗生素， 他們將來會比同時期不服用抗生素 或稍晚服用的兒童更容易變胖， 所以我們早期的干預行為 可能會給兒童的腸道微生物菌落 以及他們未來的健康埋下嚴重的隱患。"}, {"zh-tw": " So this is fascinating, because one day,in addition to the effects that antibiotics haveon antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which are very important, they may also be degradingour gut microbial ecosystems, and so one day we may cometo regard antibiotics with the same horror that we currently reservefor those metal tools that the Egyptians used to useto mush up the brains before they drained them outfor embalming. So I mentioned that microbeshave all these important functions, and they've also now,just over the past few years, been connected to a whole rangeof different diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease, heart disease, colon cancer, and even obesity.", "en": " 這是令人震驚的發現，因為將來會有一天， 抗生素除了對耐抗生素細菌 產生重大影響之外， 還可能削弱人類腸道微生物生態系統， 到那時，我們會談抗生素色變， 那種恐懼感絲毫不亞於對埃及人 使用金屬工具搗碎人腦，然後使腦漿流盡 進行屍體防腐的做法所產生的恐懼。 我剛提到了微生物具有這些重要作用， 並且經過前幾年的潛心研究， 我們發現微生物與多種疾患息息相關， 包括炎性腸病、 心臟病、結腸癌， 甚至肥胖症。"}, {"zh-tw": " Obesity has a really large effect, as it turns out, and today, we can tellwhether you're lean or obese with 90 percent accuracy by looking at the microbes in your gut. Now, although that might sound impressive, in some ways it's a little bit problematicas a medical test, because you can probably tellwhich of these people is obese without knowing anythingabout their gut microbes, but it turns out that evenif we sequence their complete genomes and had all their human DNA, we could only predict which onewas obese with about 60 percent accuracy.", "en": " 肥胖對人的影響不可小覷， 通過觀察人體腸道內的微生物， 我們現在有9成的把握 判斷一個人是消瘦還是肥胖。 儘管這聽上去令人振奮， 但就醫學試驗而言，某些方面仍存在障礙， 因為即使你對腸道微生物一無所知， 也能分辨這兩個人中誰比較胖， 而即便掌握了他們的完整基因組序列 以及全部的人體DNA， 我們也只有6成的把握推斷誰患有肥胖症。"}, {"zh-tw": " So that's amazing, right? What it means that the three poundsof microbes that you carry around with you may be more importantfor some health conditions than every single gene in your genome. And then in mice, we can do a lot more.", "en": " 是不是感到大跌眼鏡？ 這意味著對於某些健康狀況而言， 人體內的三磅微生物可能 比基因組內的每一個基因都重要。 後來，我們對小鼠做了大量的試驗。"}, {"zh-tw": " So in mice, microbes have been linkedto all kinds of additional conditions, including things like multiple sclerosis, depression, autism, and again, obesity. But how can we tell whetherthese microbial differences that correlate with diseaseare cause or effect? Well, one thing we can dois we can raise some mice without any microbes of their ownin a germ-free bubble.", "en": " 小鼠體內的微生物關乎各種健康狀況， 包括多發性硬化、 抑鬱症、自閉症，還有肥胖症。 然而，如何判斷這些與疾病息息相關的 微生物差異究竟是因還是果？ 我們做了這樣一個試驗： 在無菌氣泡袋中培育體內無自身微生物的小鼠，"}, {"zh-tw": " Then we can add in some microbesthat we think are important, and see what happens. When we take the microbesfrom an obese mouse and transplant theminto a genetically normal mouse that's been raised in a bubblewith no microbes of its own, it becomes fatter than if it got them from a regular mouse.", "en": " 然後，給它們添加一些我們認為重要的微生物， 看會發生什麼情況。 當我們從肥胖症小鼠身上提取微生物， 移植到氣泡袋中培育的 體內無自身微生物的基因正常小鼠身上時， 它比從普通小鼠移植微生物時變得更胖。"}, {"zh-tw": " Why this happensis absolutely amazing, though. Sometimes what's going onis that the microbes are helping them digest foodmore efficiently from the same diet, so they're taking more energyfrom their food, but other times, the microbesare actually affecting their behavior.", "en": " 這背後的原因令人震驚不已。 有些時候，微生物幫助 小鼠更高效地消化食物， 從而攝取更多的能量， 另一些時候，微生物實際會影響它們的行為。"}, {"zh-tw": " What they're doing is they're eatingmore than the normal mouse, so they only get fat if we let them eat as much as they want. So this is really remarkable, right? The implication is that microbescan affect mammalian behavior.", "en": " 它們吃的比正常小鼠多， 如果不加限制，只會越吃越胖。 這一點很耐人尋味，對嗎？ 它意味著微生物可能影響哺乳動物的行為。"}, {"zh-tw": " So you might be wondering whether we can also do this sort of thing across species, and it turns out that if you take microbesfrom an obese person and transplant them into miceyou've raised germ-free, those mice will also become fatter than if they received the microbesfrom a lean person, but we can design a microbial communitythat we inoculate them with that prevents themfrom gaining this weight. We can also do this for malnutrition.", "en": " 大家可能很好奇，這一做法能否沿用到其他物種？ 從一個胖人身上提取微生物， 移植到無菌培育的小鼠身上， 與從一個瘦人身上提取微生物相比， 前者會導致小鼠變得更胖， 但我們可以設計一種微生物菌落，給這些小鼠接種， 預防其體重增加。 這種做法同樣適合治療營養不良。"}, {"zh-tw": " So in a project fundedby the Gates Foundation, what we're looking atis children in Malawi who have kwashiorkor,a profound form of malnutrition, and mice that get the kwashiorkorcommunity transplanted into them lose 30 percent of their body mass in just three weeks, but we can restore their health by using the same peanut butter-based supplement that is used for the children in the clinic, and the mice that receive the community from the healthy identical twinsof the kwashiorkor children do fine. This is truly amazing because it suggeststhat we can pilot therapies by trying them outin a whole bunch of different mice with individual people's gut communities and perhaps tailor those therapiesall the way down to the individual level.", "en": " 在一個蓋茨基金會資助的專案中， 我們把關注的目光投向馬拉維 患有誇休可爾症，即惡性營養不良的兒童， 我們將誇休可爾菌落移植到小鼠體內後， 小鼠在短短三周內 體重暴降了30％， 不過，我們可以利用在診所中治療孩子的 花生醬補充物使小鼠重獲健康， 相比之下，從誇休可爾症孩子的健康同卵雙胞胎身上 移植菌落的小鼠卻健康狀況良好。 這真是不可思議，它意味著我們可以 使用不同的人體腸道菌落， 在一群小鼠中進行療法試點， 並且有望做到個性化定制。"}, {"zh-tw": " So I think it's really importantthat everyone has a chance to participate in this discovery. So, a couple of years ago, we started this projectcalled American Gut, which allows you to claim a place for yourself on this microbial map.", "en": " 所以，我認為讓每個人都有機會 從這一發現中獲益至關重要。 為此，我們在幾年前 啟動了這個名為“美國腸道”的專案， 讓每個人在這張微生物圖上占得一席之地。"}, {"zh-tw": " This is now the largest crowd-fundedscience project that we know of -- over 8,000 peoplehave signed up at this point.

On the other hand, when we do tours of our labat the BioFrontiers Institute, and we explain that we use robotsand lasers to look at poop, it turns out that noteveryone wants to know.", "en": " 我們還將結果“去識別化”， 發佈給科研人員、教育工作者，還有感興趣的普通民眾， 讓每個人都能分享這些資料。 不僅如此， 我們還來到 BioFrontiers 研究所的實驗室， 循循善誘地向大家介紹使用機器人和鐳射來觀察“粑粑”， 結果，並不是所有人都表現得興致盎然。"}, {"zh-tw": " But I'm guessing that many of you do, and so I brought some kits hereif you're interested in trying this out for yourself. So why might we want to do this? Well, it turns out that microbesare not just important for finding out where we arein terms of our health, but they can actually cure disease.", "en": " 但我猜想在座的各位很多人都有興趣， 所以我今天帶來了一些試驗用具， 有興趣的話，大家可以親自嘗試。 我們為什麼要這樣做？ 因為我們發現，微生物不僅有助於 我們瞭解自身的健康狀況， 而且能夠治癒疾病。"}, {"zh-tw": " This is one of the newest thingswe've been able to visualize with colleagues at the University of Minnesota. So here's that mapof the human microbiome again.", "en": " 這是我們與明尼蘇達大學的同事 能夠形象化展示的最新發現之一。 我們再來看一下這張人類微生物菌落圖。"}, {"zh-tw": " What we're looking at now -- I'm going to add in the communityof some people with C. diff.

Would the good microbesdo battle with the bad microbes and help to restore their health? So let's watch exactly what happens there.", "en": " 如果我們將健康捐贈者的糞菌， 即這張圖底部的星形微生物， 移植到腹瀉患者身上會怎樣？ 良性微生物與惡性微生物會相互較量， 幫助患者恢復健康嗎？ 讓我們仔細觀察究竟會發生什麼。"}, {"zh-tw": " Four of those patientsare about to get a transplant from that healthy donor at the bottom, and what you can see is that immediately, you have this radical changein the gut community. So one day after you do that transplant, all those symptoms clear up, the diarrhea vanishes, and they're essentially healthy again,coming to resemble the donor's community, and they stay there.", "en": " 其中四名患者將從底部的 健康捐贈者那裡移植糞菌， 然後你會看到腸道菌落 立刻發生天翻地覆的變化。 等到某一天移植完成後， 所有症狀蕩然無存， 腹瀉徹底消失， 患者基本恢復健康，形成了與捐贈者相似的菌落， 並長久地保持下去。"}, {"zh-tw": " So we're just at the beginningof this discovery. We're just finding out that microbeshave implications for all these different kinds of diseases, ranging from inflammatory bowel disease to obesity, and perhaps even autism and depression.", "en": " 所以，這就是我們新的發現。 微生物對各種不同的疾病， 從炎性腸病到肥胖症， 甚至包括自閉症和抑鬱症， 都具有十分重要的意義。"}, {"zh-tw": " What we need to do, though, is we need to developa kind of microbial GPS, where we don't just knowwhere we are currently but also where we want to goand what we need to do in order to get there, and we need to be ableto make this simple enough that even a child can use it. Thank you.", "en": " 我們要做的， 就是開發一種微生物 GPS， 讓我們瞭解自己目前身在何處， 未來要去往何方， 也知道如何到達目的地， 而且，我們要讓一切變簡單， 連小孩都能信手拈來。 謝謝。"}], "title": "Rob Knight How Our Microbes Make Us Who We Are"}
