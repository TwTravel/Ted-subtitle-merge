These Gapminder bubbles show you how the spread of the virus was in 1983 in the world, or how we estimate that it was. What we are showing here is -- on this axis here, I'm showing percent of infected adults.", "en": " 愛滋病是在1981年被發現的，而HIV病毒是在1983年 這張 Gapminder 氣泡圖會顯示 於1983年病毒在世界各地擴散的情況 或者說是我們對它的估計 今天我們要展示的是 這條（Y）軸，是被感染的成年人比例"}, {"zh-tw": " And on this axis, I'm showing dollars per person in income. And the size of these bubbles, the size of the bubbles here, that shows how many are infected in each country, and the color is the continent.", "en": " 而這條（X）軸，是人均收入（美元） 而這些氣泡的大小 代表每個國家被感染的人數 而顏色代表不同洲分"}, {"zh-tw": " Now, you can see United States, in 1983, had a very low percentage infected, but due to the big population, still a sizable bubble. There were quite many people infected in the United States.", "en": " 現在來看看1983年的美國 當時的感染率還非常低 但因為人口基數大，這個氣泡還是很大 也就是說在美國有很多人被感染"}, {"zh-tw": " And, up there, you see Uganda. They had almost five percent infected, and quite a big bubble in spite of being a small country, then.", "en": " 在上面是烏干達 感染率接近百分之五 雖然國家不大，但氣泡也不小"}, {"zh-tw": " And they were probably the most infected country in the world. Now, what has happened? Now you have understood the graph and now, in the next 60 seconds, we will play the HIV epidemic in the world.", "en": " 他們可能是全世界感染率最高的國家 為什麼會這樣？ 我想大家現在都能看明白這個圖表了 在接下來的60秒裏 我們會展示愛滋病疫情在世界各地蔓延的過程"}, {"zh-tw": " But first, I have a new invention here. I have solidified the beam of the laser pointer.", "en": " 但在這之前，我要先拿出我的新發明 我把鐳射筆的光線變成固體了"}, {"zh-tw": " So, ready, steady, go! First, we have the fast rise in Uganda and Zimbabwe. They went upwards like this.", "en": " 好，準備，坐穩了，開始！ 最開始是烏干達和辛巴威的感染率飆升 像這樣一直上升"}, {"zh-tw": " In Asia, the first country to be heavily infected was Thailand -- they reached one to two percent. Then, Uganda started to turn back, whereas Zimbabwe skyrocketed, and some years later South Africa had a terrible rise of HIV frequency.", "en": " 在亞洲，第一個受嚴重感染的國家是泰國 感染率達到百分之一至二 然後烏干達開始回落 而辛巴威一飛沖天 幾年後南非的HIV感染率急劇上升"}, {"zh-tw": " Look, India got many infected, but had a low level. And almost the same happens here.", "en": " 看這裏，印度也有很多人被感染 但整體比率還很低 這裏也一樣"}, {"zh-tw": " See, Uganda coming down, Zimbabwe coming down, Russia went to one percent. In the last two to three years, we have reached a steady state of HIV epidemic in the world.", "en": " 看，烏干達下降了，辛巴威下降了 俄羅斯上升到百分之一 在過去的兩三年裏 世界HIV疫情進入了穩定期"}, {"zh-tw": " 25 years it took. But, steady state doesn't mean that things are getting better, it's just that they have stopped getting worse.", "en": " 這個穩定期需時25年 但穩定並不意味著情況開始好轉 只是不再惡化而已"}, {"zh-tw": " And it has -- the steady state is, more or less, one percent of the adult world population is HIV-infected. It means 30 to 40 million people, the whole of California -- every person, that's more or less what we have today in the world.", "en": " 穩定情況就是說 世界成年人口的百分之一感染了HIV病毒 也就是說大約3000萬到4000萬人 相當於加利福尼亞州的所有人口 這就是現在全世界愛滋病患者的大概數量"}, {"zh-tw": " Now, let me make a fast replay of Botswana. Botswana -- upper middle-income country in southern Africa, democratic government, good economy, and this is what happened there.", "en": " 現在我們再快速看一下波札那的情況 波札那是為於非洲南部中上收入國家 民主政府，經濟也不俗 來看看這裏的情況"}, {"zh-tw": " They started low, they skyrocketed, they peaked up there in 2003, and now they are down. But they are falling only slowly, because in Botswana, with good economy and governance, they can manage to treat people.", "en": " 他們的感染率一開始很低，然後火箭般竄升 在2003年達到頂峰 現在有所下降 但下降的速度很慢 因為波札那的經濟政治環境不錯 可以治療愛滋病患者"}, {"zh-tw": " And if people who are infected are treated, they don't die of AIDS. These percentages won't come down because people can survive 10 to 20 years.", "en": " 感染者只要接受治療就不會輕易死於愛滋病 所以這個比例不會下降 因為病毒帶菌者可以繼續活上10年到20年"}, {"zh-tw": " So there's some problem with these metrics now. But the poorer countries in Africa, the low-income countries down here, there the rates fall faster, of the percentage infected, because people still die.", "en": " 所以這個計算方法現在有點問題 但一些非洲的窮國，像下面的這些低收入國家 感染比例下降得很快 因為感染者在不斷死亡"}, {"zh-tw": " In spite of PEPFAR, the generous PEPFAR, all people are not reached by treatment, and of those who are reached by treatment in the poor countries, only 60 percent are left on treatment after two years. It's not realistic with lifelong treatment for everyone in the poorest countries.", "en": " 儘管有慷慨的\"總統愛滋病緊急防治救援計畫\"（PEPFAR） 卻不是所有人都能得到治療 在這些貧窮國家中，即使是受到治療的那些病人 兩年後也只剩下60%的人還在治療計畫中 對窮國中的每一個患者 進行終身治療是不切實際的"}, {"zh-tw": " But it's very good that what is done is being done. But focus now is back on prevention.", "en": " 但畢竟這些工作已經很好 但現在的關注點已經回到了防預工作上"}, {"zh-tw": " It is only by stopping the transmission that the world will be able to deal with it. Drugs is too costly -- had we had the vaccine, or when we will get the vaccine, that's something more effective -- but the drugs are very costly for the poor.", "en": " 只有阻止傳播 我們的世界才會有機會對抗愛滋病 藥物太貴了 -- 要是有疫苗就好了 或者知道什麼時候會有疫苗，這樣會有效得多 但藥物對窮人來說太貴了"}, {"zh-tw": " Not the drug in itself, but the treatment and the care which is needed around it. So, when we look at the pattern, one thing comes out very clearly: you see the blue bubbles and people say HIV is very high in Africa.", "en": " 並不是藥物本身貴，而是整個治療過程 以及所需的看護很貴 所以，我們看看整個圖表 有一件事非常清楚： 你看那些藍色的氣泡 人們會說非洲的HIV比率很高"}, {"zh-tw": " I would say, HIV is very different in Africa. You'll find the highest HIV rate in the world in African countries, and yet you'll find Senegal, down here -- the same rate as United States.", "en": " 我必須說，HIV在非洲也是非常不同的 你們會發現世界上最高的HIV感染率 是在非洲國家 但這裏也有塞內加爾，在下面 感染率和美國一樣"}, {"zh-tw": " And you'll find Madagascar, and you'll find a lot of African countries about as low as the rest of the world. It's this terrible simplification that there's one Africa and things go on in one way in Africa.", "en": " 也有馬達加斯加 而其他很多非洲國家 和世界其他地方的感染率一樣低 所以認為非洲的所有事情都是一個樣 將非洲簡單地同一化是很可怕的"}, {"zh-tw": " We have to stop that. It's not respectful, and it's not very clever to think that way.", "en": " 我們不能再這麼想 這麼想很不尊重他們 也很不明智"}, {"zh-tw": " I had the fortune to live and work for a time in the United States. I found out that Salt Lake City and San Francisco were different.", "en": " 我有幸在美國生活和工作過一段時間 我發現鹽湖城和舊金山就很不一樣"}, {"zh-tw": " And so it is in Africa -- it's a lot of difference. So, why is it so high? Is it war? No, it's not. Look here.", "en": " 非洲也是一樣 -- 各地有很多不同 那，為什麼比率會這麼高呢？是因為戰爭的關係？ 不是的。看這裏"}, {"zh-tw": " War-torn Congo is down there -- two, three, four percent. And this is peaceful Zambia, neighboring country -- 15 percent.", "en": " 飽經戰火的剛果在下面 -- 百分之二、三、四的樣子 而和平的鄰國赞比亚 -- 百分之十五"}, {"zh-tw": " And there's good studies of the refugees coming out of Congo -- they have two, three percent infected, and peaceful Zambia -- much higher. There are now studies clearly showing that the wars are terrible, that rapes are terrible, but this is not the driving force for the high levels in Africa.", "en": " 有人研究過剛果難民的感染率 也在百分之二到三之間 而和平的赞比亚要高得多 現在有研究明確岀指出 雖然有很多戰爭，很多強暴事件發生 但這並不是非洲HIV病毒高比率的主要原因"}, {"zh-tw": " So, is it poverty? Well if you look at the macro level, it seems more money, more HIV. But that's very simplistic, so let's go down and look at Tanzania.", "en": " 所以，是因為貧窮嗎？ 如果我們從宏觀角度看看 好像錢越多，HIV就越多 但這過於簡單化了 我們來仔細看看坦桑尼亞的情況"}, {"zh-tw": " I will split Tanzania in five income groups, from the highest income to the lowest income, and here we go. The ones with the highest income, the better off -- I wouldn't say rich -- they have higher HIV.", "en": " 我把坦桑尼亞人按收入分成五組 從最高收入到最低收入 我們來看看 收入最高的人，處境較好的人，我不會叫他們富人 他們的HIV感染率更高"}, {"zh-tw": " The difference goes from 11 percent down to four percent, and it is even bigger among women. There's a lot of things that we thought, that now, good research, done by African institutions and researchers together with the international researchers, show that that's not the case.", "en": " 感染率最高有百分之十一，最低的到百分之四 婦女中這個差距更大 許多我們以前的想法，被現在許多由 非洲及國際機構和研究人員所做的研究 證實是錯誤的"}, {"zh-tw": " So, this is the difference within Tanzania. And, I can't avoid showing Kenya.", "en": " 這是坦桑尼亞的例子 我必須再舉一下肯亞的例子"}, {"zh-tw": " Look here at Kenya. I've split Kenya in its provinces.", "en": " 來看看肯亞 我按省份劃分肯亞"}, {"zh-tw": " Here it goes. See the difference within one African country -- it goes from very low level to very high level, and most of the provinces in Kenya is quite modest.", "en": " 來看看 在同一個非洲國家裏的差別 從很低的水平到很高的水平 而肯亞大部分的省份感染率並不高"}, {"zh-tw": " So, what is it then? Why do we see this extremely high levels in some countries? Well, it is more common with multiple partners, there is less condom use, and there is age-disparate sex -- that is, older men tend to have sex with younger women. We see higher rates in younger women than younger men in many of these highly affected countries.", "en": " 那到底是什麼原因呢？ 為什麼有些國家的感染率那麼高？ 其中因素包括有多個性伴侶， 或不愛用避孕套 或有年齡差異大的性愛因素 就是大年紀男人喜歡跟年輕女人做愛 所以我們發現在很多感染率較高的國家裏 年輕女性的感染率要高於年輕男性"}, {"zh-tw": " But where are they situated? I will swap the bubbles to a map. Look, the highly infected are four percent of all population and they hold 50 percent of the HIV-infected.", "en": " 那地理上的分佈又是怎麼樣呢？ 我把氣泡轉移到地圖上 看，感染率高的國家佔世界人口的百分之四 但卻有全球百分之五十的HIV感染者"}, {"zh-tw": " HIV exists all over the world. Look, you have bubbles all over the world here.", "en": " HIV在世界各地都存在 看，氣泡分佈在所有地方"}, {"zh-tw": " Brazil has many HIV-infected. Arab countries not so much, but Iran is quite high.", "en": " 巴西有很多HIV感染者 阿拉伯國家不多，但伊朗很高"}, {"zh-tw": " They have heroin addiction and also prostitution in Iran. India has many because they are many.", "en": " 伊朗的問題是海洛因和賣淫 印度有很多因為它本身人口多"}, {"zh-tw": " Southeast Asia, and so on. But, there is one part of Africa -- and the difficult thing is, at the same time, not to make a uniform statement about Africa, not to come to simple ideas of why it is like this, on one hand.", "en": " 以及東南亞等等 但非洲有一部分 -- 同時要注意的是 不要說到非洲就想到整個非洲 一方面不要認為出現現在的情況是因為單一的原因"}, {"zh-tw": " On the other hand, try to say that this is not the case, because there is a scientific consensus about this pattern now. UNAIDS have done good data available, finally, about the spread of HIV.", "en": " 另一方面要承認現在的情況很嚴重 現在科學界已經對這個分佈圖達成了共識 UNAIDS終於提供了HIV傳播的 詳細數據"}, {"zh-tw": " It could be concurrency. It could be some virus types.", "en": " 可能是由於多重性伴 也可能是某些病毒種類"}, {"zh-tw": " It could be that there is other things which makes transmission occur in a higher frequency. After all, if you are completely healthy and you have heterosexual sex, the risk of infection in one intercourse is one in 1,000.", "en": " 也可能是有別的原因 使病毒傳播到這樣高的比例 不管怎樣，如果你完全健康並且是異性戀 每次性交被感染的機會是千分之一"}, {"zh-tw": " Don't jump to conclusions now on how to behave tonight and so on. But -- and if you are in an unfavorable situation, more sexually transmitted diseases, it can be one in 100.", "en": " 但別輕易得出結論 今晚就去胡混 但是，如果你處於不利情況 通過性傳染的疾病機會可以達到百分之一"}, {"zh-tw": " But what we think is that it could be concurrency. And what is concurrency? In Sweden, we have no concurrency.", "en": " 但我們認為多個性伴可能是主要原因 什麼是多重性伴侶？ 在瑞典我們沒有多重性伴侶"}, {"zh-tw": " We have serial monogamy. Vodka, New Year's Eve -- new partner for the spring.", "en": " 我們是連續的單一性伴侶 喝伏特加，除夕夜 -- 春天有新性伴了"}, {"zh-tw": " Vodka, Midsummer's Eve -- new partner for the fall. Vodka -- and it goes on like this, you know? And you collect a big number of exes.", "en": " 喝伏特加，仲夏夜 -- 秋天有新性伴了 喝伏特加 -- 繼續這樣子，你們明白了嗎？ 這樣你會有很多“前”男、女朋友"}, {"zh-tw": " And we have a terrible chlamydia epidemic -- terrible chlamydia epidemic which sticks around for many years. HIV has a peak three to six weeks after infection and therefore, having more than one partner in the same month is much more dangerous for HIV than others.", "en": " 有一種可怕的衣原體傳染病 這種可怕的衣原體傳染病持續多年 而HIV是在感染後的三到六周有一個活動高峰 因此，在一個月裏有多個性夥伴 對HIV傳播是特別危險的"}, {"zh-tw": " Probably, it's a combination of this. And what makes me so happy is that we are moving now towards fact when we look at this.", "en": " 很可能，這是原因之一 還有令我高興的是,當我們在考慮這些因素的時候 我們也不斷地向真相邁步"}, {"zh-tw": " You can get this chart, free. We have uploaded UNAIDS data on the Gapminder site.", "en": " 大家可以免費取得這份圖表 我們把UNAIDS的資料上傳到Gapminder.org"}, {"zh-tw": " And we hope that when we act on global problems in the future we will not only have the heart, we will not only have the money, but we will also use the brain.
