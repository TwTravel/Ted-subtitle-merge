Is Earth special? This is a question I've wantedto know the answer to since I was a small child, and I suspect 80 percentof this auditorium has thought the same thingand also wanted to know the answer.", "en": " 我們找過其它地方， 可能找得還不夠勤快， 但是我們找過，沒有發現任何生物。 地球是我們所知唯一有生命的地方。 地球得天獨厚嗎？ 這個問題的答案 我從小時候就想知道， 而且我猜禮堂裡八成的人 都想過同樣的事，也想知道答案。"}, {"zh-tw": " To understand whetherthere are any planets -- out there in our solar system or beyond -- that can support life, the first step is to understandwhat life here requires. It turns out, of all of those8.7 million species, life only needs three things.", "en": " 要知道是否有別的行星── 無論是在我們的太陽系還是其它地方── 能支持生命， 第一步要了解在這裡生命的要素是什麼。 事實證明，這八百七十萬種物種 只需要三件事就能維持生命。"}, {"zh-tw": " On one side, all lifeon Earth needs energy. Complex life like us derivesour energy from the sun, but life deep undergroundcan get its energy from things like chemical reactions.", "en": " 那邊那張照片，地球上所有的生命都要能量， 像我們這樣的複合生物體要從太陽取得能量， 地下深處的生物 則從化學反應取得能量。"}, {"zh-tw": " There are a numberof different energy sources available on all planets. On the other side, all life needs food or nourishment.", "en": " 地球上有很多種能量來源 可供大家使用。 另外那一邊照片， 所有的生命都需要食物或營養。"}, {"zh-tw": " And this seems like a tall order,especially if you want a succulent tomato. However, all life on Earthderives its nourishment from only six chemical elements, and these elements can be foundon any planetary body in our solar system.", "en": " 這聽起來像是無理的要求，尤其在你想要一顆多汁的番茄時。 （譯註：一般超市的番茄都很乾） 然而，地球上所有的生命 只要六種化學元素就能取得營養， 而這些元素可在 我們的太陽系中每一個行星體上找到。"}, {"zh-tw": " So that leaves the thingin the middle as the tall pole, the thing that's hardest to achieve. Not moose, but water.", "en": " 所以這讓中間這項成了高不可及、 很難拿到的東西。 不是麋鹿，是水。"}, {"zh-tw": " Although moose would be pretty cool.

So that leaves a few bodiesthat we should think about.", "en": " 有些太陽系可能有大量液態水， 甚至可能多過地球， 但是都困在冰層底下， 所以很難拿到，很難接近， 甚至很難發現那裡到底有沒有生命。 這樣只剩下幾座星體我們應該考慮。"}, {"zh-tw": " So let's make the problemsimpler for ourselves. Let's think only about liquid wateron the surface of a planet.", "en": " 所以我們來為自己簡化一下問題。 我們只要想想在星球表面的液態水就好。"}, {"zh-tw": " There are only three bodiesto think about in our solar system, with regard to liquid wateron the surface of a planet, and in order of distance from the sun,it's: Venus, Earth and Mars. You want to have an atmospherefor water to be liquid.", "en": " 這樣我們的太陽系裡只剩三座星體可想， 考慮行星表面是否有液態水， 與太陽的距離依次是金星、地球及火星。 你要有大氣層使水能維持液態。"}, {"zh-tw": " You have to be very carefulwith that atmosphere. You can't have too much atmosphere,too thick or too warm an atmosphere, because then you end uptoo hot like Venus, and you can't have liquid water.", "en": " 你必須非常小心考慮大氣層。 你不能有太大的大氣層，太厚或太溫暖都不行， 因為這樣會像金星一樣太熱， 而且沒有液態水。"}, {"zh-tw": " But if you have too little atmosphereand it's too thin and too cold, you end up like Mars, too cold. So Venus is too hot, Mars is too cold, and Earth is just right.", "en": " 但是如果你的大氣層太少，而且太薄太冷， 結果就會像火星一樣太冷。 所以金星太熱，火星太冷， 地球則是剛剛好。"}, {"zh-tw": " You can look at these images behind meand you can see automatically where life can survivein our solar system. It's a Goldilocks-type problem, and it's so simplethat a child could understand it.", "en": " 看看我後面的照片，你自然會看到 我們的太陽系哪裡有生命可以存活。 這是典型的《金髮女孩與三隻熊》問題， 而且這太簡單了，小孩都能理解。"}, {"zh-tw": " However, I'd like to remind you of two things from the Goldilocks storythat we may not think about so often but that I think are really relevant here. Number one: if Mama Bear's bowl is too cold when Goldilocks walks into the room, does that mean it's always been too cold? Or could it have been just rightat some other time? When Goldilocks walks into the roomdetermines the answer that we get in the story.", "en": " 然而， 我要提醒各位兩件事， 是《金髮女孩與三隻熊》故事中，常常被我們忽略 但我認為非常切題的事。 第一： 金髮女孩走進屋時，如果熊媽媽碗裡的粥太冷， 那是指粥早就冷了？ 還是曾有剛剛好的時間？ 金髮女孩走進屋的時間決定了 故事的答案。"}, {"zh-tw": " And the same is true with planets. They're not static things. They change.", "en": " 行星也一樣。 行星不是靜態的東西。它們一直在改變。"}, {"zh-tw": " They vary. They evolve. And atmospheres do the same.", "en": " 它們變化，它們演化。 大氣層也一樣。"}, {"zh-tw": " So let me give you an example. Here's one of my favoritepictures of Mars.", "en": " 我舉一個例子。 這是我很愛的一張火星照片。"}, {"zh-tw": " It's not the highest resolution image,it's not the sexiest image, it's not the most recent image, but it's an image that shows riverbedscut into the surface of the planet; riverbeds carved by flowing, liquid water; riverbeds that take hundreds or thousandsor tens of thousands of years to form. This can't happen on Mars today.", "en": " 這既非最高解析度，也並非最美， 更不是最新的照片， 但這張照片顯示河床切過行星表面； 被流動、液態水切割出的河床； 河床要上百、上千甚至上萬年才能形成。 現在的火星不可能發生這件事。"}, {"zh-tw": " The atmosphere of Mars todayis too thin and too cold for water to be stable as a liquid. This one image tells youthat the atmosphere of Mars changed, and it changed in big ways.", "en": " 現在的火星大氣層太薄太冷， 水因而不能維持液態。 這一張照片告訴我們火星的大氣改變了， 而且改變很大。"}, {"zh-tw": " And it changed from a statethat we would define as habitable, because the three requirementsfor life were present long ago. Where did that atmosphere go that allowed waterto be liquid at the surface? Well, one idea is it escapedaway to space.", "en": " 它從我們定義的適居狀態變成現在的樣子， 因為生命三大要素在很久以前曾經出現過。 本來能讓水在地表維持液態的大氣去了哪裡？ 嗯，有人說它逃逸到宇宙。"}, {"zh-tw": " Atmospheric particlesgot enough energy to break free from the gravity of the planet, escaping away to space, never to return. And this happens with all bodieswith atmospheres.", "en": " 大氣粒子有足夠的能量 逃脫此行星的重力， 散逸到太空，一去不返。 這種現象在有大氣的星體上都會發生。"}, {"zh-tw": " Comets have tails that are incredibly visible remindersof atmospheric escape. But Venus also has an atmospherethat escapes with time, and Mars and Earth as well.", "en": " 彗星的尾巴 正是大氣逃逸絕佳的視覺提醒。 但是金星的大氣也會隨時間逃逸， 火星及地球也一樣。"}, {"zh-tw": " It's just a matter of degreeand a matter of scale. So we'd like to figure outhow much escaped over time so we can explain this transition.", "en": " 這只是程度及規模的問題。 所以我們要找出逃逸的速率， 才能解釋這種轉變。"}, {"zh-tw": " How do atmospheresget their energy for escape? How do particles getenough energy to escape? There are two ways, if we're goingto reduce things a little bit. Number one, sunlight.", "en": " 大氣怎麼得到逃逸所需的能量？ 粒子怎麼得到足以逃逸的能量？ 如果我們簡化一下來看，有兩種方式。 第一，陽光。"}, {"zh-tw": " Light emitted from the sun can be absorbedby atmospheric particles and warm the particles. Yes, I'm dancing, but they -- Oh my God, not even at my wedding.", "en": " 從太陽射出的光被大氣粒子吸收， 使粒子增溫。 是，我是在跳舞，不過它們── 天啊，我在自己的婚禮上都沒跳。"}, {"zh-tw": " They get enough energyto escape and break free from the gravity of the planetjust by warming. A second way they can get energyis from the solar wind.", "en": " 它們得到足夠的能量逃逸 並掙脫重力，這一切只要增溫就夠了。 得到能量的第二種方法是太陽風。"}, {"zh-tw": " These are particles, mass, material,spit out from the surface of the sun, and they go screamingthrough the solar system at 400 kilometers per second, sometimes faster during solar storms, and they go hurtlingthrough interplanetary space towards planets and their atmospheres, and they may provide energy for atmospheric particlesto escape as well. This is something that I'm interested in, because it relates to habitability.", "en": " 這些是從太陽表面噴出的粒子、團塊及物質， 而且它們在太陽系裡 以每秒 400 公里的速率呼嘯而過， 在太陽風暴期間有時候還更快， 而且它們飛馳通過行星際空間， 朝著行星及其大氣飛去， 因而它們也可以提供能量 讓大氣粒子逃逸。 這就是我感興趣的東西， 因為這跟適居性有關。"}, {"zh-tw": " I mentioned that there were two thingsabout the Goldilocks story that I wanted to bring to your attentionand remind you about, and the second oneis a little bit more subtle. If Papa Bear's bowl is too hot, and Mama Bear's bowl is too cold, shouldn't Baby Bear's bowl be even colder if we're following the trend? This thing that you've acceptedyour entire life, when you think about it a little bit more,may not be so simple.", "en": " 我曾說過金髮女孩的故事中有兩件事 我要你們注意並提醒你們一下， 第二件事更微妙一點。 如果熊爸爸碗裡的粥太燙了， 而熊媽媽的粥太冷了， 那熊寶寶的粥不就應該更冷了， 如果我們順著趨勢想？ 你一輩子都沒懷疑過的這件事， 仔細一想後可能沒那麼簡單。"}, {"zh-tw": " And of course, distance of a planetfrom the sun determines its temperature. This has to play into habitability.", "en": " 當然，行星的溫度取決於它與太陽的距離。 這就與適居性有關。"}, {"zh-tw": " But maybe there are other thingswe should be thinking about. Maybe it's the bowls themselves that are also helping to determinethe outcome in the story, what is just right.", "en": " 但是我們可能還必須考慮其它事。 可能碗本身 也會決定這個故事的結局， 也就是「剛剛好」的問題。"}, {"zh-tw": " I could talk to you about a lotof different characteristics of these three planets that may influence habitability, but for selfish reasons relatedto my own research and the fact that I'm standing up hereholding the clicker and you're not -- I would like to talkfor just a minute or two about magnetic fields. Earth has one; Venus and Mars do not.", "en": " 我可以跟大家講很多 這三個行星不同的特性， 這些特性可能也會影響適居性， 但是我有私心，因為那跟我的研究有關係， 而且站在這裡拿著遙控器的是我，不是你們── 所以我只跟你們講一兩分鐘就好， 來談一下磁場。 地球有磁場；金星及火星沒有。"}, {"zh-tw": " Magnetic fields are generatedin the deep interior of a planet by electrically conductingchurning fluid material that creates this big old magnetic fieldthat surrounds Earth. If you have a compass,you know which way north is.", "en": " 磁場在行星內部深處產生， 由導電的液態物質環繞流動 而產生這個環繞地球的巨大古老磁場。 如果你有羅盤，你會知道哪邊是北邊。"}, {"zh-tw": " Venus and Mars don't have that. If you have a compass on Venus and Mars, congratulations, you're lost.", "en": " 金星與火星沒有這個。 如果你在金星及火星上用羅盤， 恭喜喔！你迷路了。"}, {"zh-tw": " Does this influence habitability? Well, how might it? Many scientists thinkthat a magnetic field of a planet serves as a shield for the atmosphere, deflecting solar wind particlesaround the planet in a bit of a force field-type effect having to do with electric chargeof those particles. I like to think of it insteadas a salad bar sneeze guard for planets.", "en": " 這會影響適居性嗎？ 又怎麼影響？ 許多科學家認為行星的磁場 就像大氣層的防護罩， 使在行星四周的太陽風粒子偏轉， 有點像（星際爭霸戰）力場防護罩效應， 因為跟這些粒子的電荷有關。 我喜歡把它比喻為沙拉吧上面擋噴嚏的防護罩。"}, {"zh-tw": " And yes, my colleagueswho watch this later will realize this is the first time in the historyof our community that the solar wind has beenequated with mucus. OK, so the effect, then, is that Earthmay have been protected for billions of years, because we've had a magnetic field.", "en": " 是的，以後看這片的同僚會發現， 這是史上頭一遭有人在我們這行 把太陽風等同為黏液。 好吧，所以這個效應，就是地球可以受到保護 幾十億年， 因為我們有磁場。"}, {"zh-tw": " Atmosphere hasn't been able to escape. Mars, on the other hand,has been unprotected because of its lack of magnetic field, and over billions of years, maybe enough atmospherehas been stripped away to account for a transitionfrom a habitable planet to the planet that we see today.", "en": " 大氣至今無法逃脫。 另一方面，火星沒有受到保護， 因為它沒有磁場， 所以幾十億年來， 可能已經揭掉了夠多的大氣， 使這個原本適居的行星轉變為 今天我們看到的樣子。"}, {"zh-tw": " Other scientists thinkthat magnetic fields may act more like the sails on a ship, enabling the planet to interactwith more energy from the solar wind than the planet would have been ableto interact with by itself. The sails may gather energyfrom the solar wind.", "en": " 其他科學家認為磁場的 作用可能更像船上的帆， 讓行星能與太陽風的能量產生更多交互作用， 比自身的交互作用還要更多。 帆可以聚集風的能量。"}, {"zh-tw": " The magnetic field may gatherenergy from the solar wind that allows even moreatmospheric escape to happen. It's an idea that has to be tested, but the effect and how it works seems apparent.", "en": " 磁場可以聚集太陽風的能量， 讓更多大氣逃逸。 這個理論還需要證明， 但是其影響及作用方式 看起來很明顯。"}, {"zh-tw": " That's because we know energy from the solar windis being deposited into our atmosphere here on Earth. That energy is conductedalong magnetic field lines down into the polar regions, resulting in incredibly beautiful aurora.", "en": " 那是因為我們知道 太陽風的能量會注入 地球上的大氣層。 那股能量順著磁力線傳導， 向下導入兩極， 產生炫麗無比的極光。"}, {"zh-tw": " If you've ever experienced them,it's magnificent. We know the energy is getting in.", "en": " 如果你曾看過極光，那真是壯麗！ 我們知道能量進來了。"}, {"zh-tw": " We're trying to measurehow many particles are getting out and if the magnetic fieldis influencing this in any way. So I've posed a problem for you here, but I don't have a solution yet.", "en": " 我們試著測量有多少粒子跑出去， 還有磁場是否以任何方式影響這一點。 所以我丟了一個問題給各位， 但是我還沒有答案。"}, {"zh-tw": " We don't have a solution. But we're working on it.How are we working on it? Well, we've sent spacecraftto all three planets.", "en": " 我們沒有解答。 但是我們正在找。怎麼找呢？ 嗯，我們送了幾艘太空船到這三個行星上。"}, {"zh-tw": " Some of them are orbiting now, including the MAVEN spacecraftwhich is currently orbiting Mars, which I'm involved withand which is led here, out of the University of Colorado. It's designed to measureatmospheric escape.", "en": " 有些已經在軌道上環繞了， 包括目前正在環繞火星的 MAVEN（火星大氣與揮發物演化任務）太空船， 我有參與這項計畫， 而且由此地的科羅拉多大學領導。 我們用它測量大氣逃逸。"}, {"zh-tw": " We have similar measurementsfrom Venus and Earth. Once we have all our measurements, we can combine all these together,and we can understand how all three planets interactwith their space environment, with the surroundings.", "en": " 我們對金星及地球也做了類似的測量。 一旦我們收及到所有的測量數據， 我們就能把這些綜合起來，我們就能了解 這三個行星如何與太空環境， 與它們周邊的環境交互作用，"}, {"zh-tw": " And we can decide whether magnetic fieldsare important for habitability or not. Once we have that answer,why should you care? I mean, I care deeply ...", "en": " 我們就能決定磁場對適居性的重要與否。 一旦我們有了答案，我們為什麼要在意？ 我是說，我很在意──"}, {"zh-tw": " And financially as well, but deeply. First of all, an answer to this question will teach us moreabout these three planets, Venus, Earth and Mars, not only about how they interactwith their environment today, but how they were billions of years ago, whether they were habitablelong ago or not.", "en": " 財務上我也很在意啦！不過真的很在意。 首先，這個問題的答案 會教我們更多這三個行星的事， 金星、地球及火星， 不只是它們如何與現今的環境交互作用， 還有幾十億以前的交互作用， 很久以前的適居性如何。"}, {"zh-tw": " It will teach us about atmospheres that surround us and that are close. But moreover, what we learnfrom these planets can be applied to atmospheres everywhere, including planets that we're nowobserving around other stars.", "en": " 它會教我們很多 環繞及靠近我們的大氣層的事。 此外，我們從這幾個行星學到的， 可以應用到別處的大氣層， 包括我們正在觀察的幾個行星，它們環繞著其它恆星。"}, {"zh-tw": " For example, the Kepler spacecraft, which is built and controlledhere in Boulder, has been observinga postage stamp-sized region of the sky for a couple years now, and it's found thousands of planets -- in one postage stamp-sizedregion of the sky that we don't think is any differentfrom any other part of the sky. We've gone, in 20 years, from knowing of zero planetsoutside of our solar system, to now having so many, that we don't knowwhich ones to investigate first.", "en": " 舉個例子，克卜勒太空望遠鏡， 就在波德這裡建造並控制， 已經觀察了郵票大小的天空 好幾年了， 它發現了數千個行星── 就在郵票大小的一小片天空中， 這片天跟其它部分的天空沒什麼不同。 在 20 年內，我們從以為 太陽系以外沒有行星， 到現在我們知道有這麼多， 甚至不知道該從哪一個開始調查起。"}, {"zh-tw": " Any lever will help. In fact, based on observationsthat Kepler's taken and other similar observations, we now believe that, of the 200 billion starsin the Milky Way galaxy alone, on average, every starhas at least one planet.", "en": " 任何方法都有幫助。 其實，從克卜勒太空望遠鏡 及其它類似的觀測所發現的來看， 我們現在相信 光是在我們銀河系的二千億顆星星裡， 每顆星平均都至少有一個行星。"}, {"zh-tw": " In addition to that, estimates suggest there are somewherebetween 40 billion and 100 billion of those planetsthat we would define as habitable in just our galaxy. We have the observations of those planets, but we just don't knowwhich ones are habitable yet.", "en": " 除此之外， 估計這些行星中還有約四百億到一千億顆， 我們可以定義為適居， 僅僅在我們的銀河！ 我們有這些行星的觀測， 但是我們還不知道哪一個是適合居住的。"}, {"zh-tw": " It's a little bit likebeing trapped on a red spot -- on a stage and knowing that there areother worlds out there and desperately wanting to knowmore about them, wanting to interrogate them and find outif maybe just one or two of them are a little bit like you. You can't do that.You can't go there, not yet.", "en": " 這就跟困在 TED 這塊紅地毯上一樣， 在舞台上， 你知道還有其它的世界存在， 極度想要更了解他們， 想調查並找出是不是有一兩個 和自己有點像。 你做不了這件事，你去不了那裡，還不行。"}, {"zh-tw": " And so you have to use the toolsthat you've developed around you for Venus, Earth and Mars, and you have to apply themto these other situations, and hope that you're makingreasonable inferences from the data, and that you're going to be ableto determine the best candidates for habitable planets,and those that are not. In the end, and for now, at least, this is our red spot, right here.", "en": " 所以你必須使用你手邊 為了金星、地球及火星而發展的工具， 還必須將它們應用在這些不同的狀況下， 希望自己能從數據做出合理的推斷， 希望自己能選出最好的 適居行星，還要找出不合適的。 最終，至少目前， 這是我們的紅地毯，就在這裡。"}, {"zh-tw": " This is the only planetthat we know of that's habitable, although very soon we maycome to know of more.
