And what you see here is, you see a little bit of crude oil, you see some ice cubes, and you see two sandwich baggies of napalm.", "en": " 這是一張我在2002年 造訪阿拉斯加的普拉德霍灣時的照片 我去巡視礦產管理服務 並測試他們的能力 在寒冰上燃燒漏油 在這裡你可以看到一點原油 一些冰塊 看到兩個三明治大小的凝固汽油彈"}, {"zh-tw": " The napalm is burning there quite nicely. And the thing is, is that oil is really an abstraction for us as the American consumer.", "en": " 凝固汽油彈正在燃燒 對於我們這些美國消費者來說 石油是一種抽象過程"}, {"zh-tw": " We're four percent of the world's population; we use 25 percent of the world's oil production.

It takes off. It's a big woosh.", "en": " 這就是石油燃燒的景象 它賤起火花，轟的一聲"}, {"zh-tw": " I highly recommend that you get a chance to see crude oil burn someday, because you will never need to hear another poli sci lecture on the geopolitics of oil again. It'll just bake your retinas.", "en": " 我強烈推薦大家有機會的話去看一下原油燃燒的景象 如此一來你便不需要再去聽別的波利科技講座 是有關石油地緣政治學的演講了 它將烘烤你的視網膜"}, {"zh-tw": " So there it is; the retinas are baking. Let me tell you a little bit about this chemistry of oil.", "en": " 就像這樣, 烘烤視網膜 讓我來講一下石油的化學性質"}, {"zh-tw": " Oil is a stew of hydrocarbon molecules. It starts of with the very small ones, which are one carbon, four hydrogen -- that's methane -- it just floats off.", "en": " 石油是碳氫化合物分子的混合物 剛開始的時候非常小 1個碳原子,4個氫原子 這就是漂浮在上面的甲烷"}, {"zh-tw": " Then there's all sorts of intermediate ones with middle amounts of carbon. You've probably heard of benzene rings; they're very carcinogenic.", "en": " 然後還有各種的介質混合中等數量的碳 你們可能聽說過苯環，它的致癌性很高"}, {"zh-tw": " And it goes all the way over to these big, thick, galumphy ones that have hundreds of carbons, and they have thousands of hydrogens, and they have vanadium and heavy metals and sulfur and all kinds of craziness hanging off the sides of them.

Oil doesn't sink, it floats.", "en": " 也是讓石油變成災難的化學成分 石油在水裡不會下沈，而是漂浮在水面"}, {"zh-tw": " If it sank, it would be a whole different story as far as an oil spill.

It triples the amount of oily, messy goo that you have in the water, and it makes it very hard to handle.", "en": " 然後還有瀝青質 - 這是關鍵的東西 - 瀝青質被海浪掀起 乳化成泡沫，類似蛋黃醬 面積變成三倍 油膩膩的，骯髒混亂的在水中 這使得它很難處理"}, {"zh-tw": " It also makes it very viscous.

I am helpless over this.\" And this is what happens to us at the gas pump -- and actually, gas pumps are specifically designed to diffuse that anger.", "en": " 我甚至不知道他們什麼時候會調高價格 這樣會讓我很無奈。“ 這就是發生我們在加油站的狀況。 而實際上，加油站有特別的設計去 化解這種憤怒。"}, {"zh-tw": " You might notice that many gas pumps, including this one, are designed to look like ATMs. I've talked to engineers. That's specifically to diffuse our anger, because supposedly we feel good about ATMs.", "en": " 您可能會注意到，許多加油站，包括這一個， 設計看起來像自動取款機。 我有和工程師談論過。這是專門設計減低我們的憤怒， 因為據說我們在自動取款機前會感覺良好。 （眾笑）"}, {"zh-tw": " That shows you how bad it is. But actually, I mean, this feeling of helplessness comes in because most Americans actually feel that oil prices are the result of a conspiracy, not of the vicissitudes of the world oil market.", "en": " 這表明你是多麼糟糕。 但實際上，我的意思是，這種無奈的感覺 大多數美國人實際感受到 石油價格是一個陰謀的結果 不是世界石油市場所形成的。"}, {"zh-tw": " And the thing is, too, is that we also feel very helpless about the amount that we consume, which is somewhat reasonable, because in fact, we have designed this system where, if you want to get a job, it's much more important to have a car that runs, to have a job and keep a job, than to have a GED. And that's actually very perverse.", "en": " 而事實上也是 我們也對於我們消費的金額感到很無奈 這是某些理由 因為，事實上，這是我們造成的 在那裡，如果你想找到一份工作， 要有車可以開是很重要的 這樣才能有一份工作，保持一份工作 而這其實是很反常的"}, {"zh-tw": " Now there's another perverse thing about the way we buy gas, which is that we'd rather be doing anything else. This is BP's gas station in downtown Los Angeles.", "en": " 現在有另一種有害的東西是有關我們買天然氣 我們寧願做別的 這是BP的加油站 在洛杉磯市中心"}, {"zh-tw": " It is green. It is a shrine to greenishness. \"Now,\" you think, \"why would something so lame work on people so smart?\" Well, the reason is, is because, when we're buying gas, we're very invested in this sort of cognitive dissonance.", "en": " 它是綠色的。是淺綠色。 現在，你想想，為什麼這東西會如此跛腳 對人卻是這麼聰明？“ 是的，原因是，因為當我們買天然氣 我們非常投入在這樣的認知失調"}, {"zh-tw": " I mean, we're angry at the one hand and we want to be somewhere else. We don't want to be buying oil; we want to be doing something green.", "en": " 我的意思是，一方面，我們感到憤怒，我們想要去別處。 我們不想要去買石油 我們希望做一些環保的事"}, {"zh-tw": " And we get kind of in on our own con. I mean -- and this is funny, it looks funny here.", "en": " 我們被自己哄騙 我的意思是 - 這是很有趣的事 在這裡這件事看起來很有趣"}, {"zh-tw": " But in fact, that's why the slogan \"beyond petroleum\" worked. But it's an inherent part of our energy policy, which is we don't talk about reducing the amount of oil that we use.", "en": " 但事實上，這就是為什麼這個口號“超越石油”是有效的。 但在我們的能源政策中它是一個固有的一部分 這我們不談論 減少我們使用石油的數量，"}, {"zh-tw": " We talk about energy independence. We talk about hydrogen cars. We talk about biofuels that haven't been invented yet.", "en": " 我們談論能源獨立。我們談論氫汽車。 我們談論還沒有發明的生物燃料"}, {"zh-tw": " And so, cognitive dissonance is part and parcel of the way that we deal with oil, and it's really important to dealing with this oil spill. Okay, so the politics of oil are very moral in the United States.", "en": " 因此，認知失調 我們處理石油的方式是不可或缺的一部分， 處理溢油是真正重要的。 OK，政治石油 美國是很不道德的。"}, {"zh-tw": " The oil industry is like a huge, gigantic octopus of engineering and finance and everything else, but we actually see it in very moral terms. This is an early-on photograph -- you can see, we had these gushers.", "en": " 石油工業是像一個無底洞 對於工程及財務 和其他一切 但我們真正看到它在道德上。 這是一張早期的照片。你可以看到，我們有這些噴油井。"}, {"zh-tw": " Early journalists looked at these spills, and they said, \"This is a filthy industry.\" But they also saw in it that people were getting rich for doing nothing. They weren't farmers, they were just getting rich for stuff coming out of the ground.", "en": " 記者看著這些早期漏油， 他們說，“這是一個骯髒的行業。” 但他們也從中看到了 人們的生活越來越富裕且不勞而獲。 他們不是農民，他們只是得到豐富的東西出自於地底。"}, {"zh-tw": " It's the \"Beverly Hillbillies,\" basically. But in the beginning, this was seen as a very morally problematic thing, long before it became funny.", "en": " 這是“暴發戶”基本上是這樣。 但在一開始，這個被認為是一個非常不道德的事情， 不久，就成為笑話。"}, {"zh-tw": " And then, of course, there was John D. Rockefeller. And the thing about John D. is that he went into this chaotic wild-east of oil industry, and he rationalized it into a vertically integrated company, a multinational.", "en": " 當然，還有約翰洛克菲勒。 和他有關的的事情是... 他走進這未開發的東部 石油工業， 他合理化它 垂直整合成一個公司，一家跨國公司。"}, {"zh-tw": " It was terrifying; you think Walmart is a terrifying business model now, imagine what this looked like in the 1860s or 1870s. And it also the kind of root of how we see oil as a conspiracy.", "en": " 這是非常可怕的。就像你認為沃爾瑪現今是一個可怕的商業模式， 這看上去就像19世紀 60年代或19世紀 70年代。 它也是一種 我們如何看到油作為一個陰謀。"}, {"zh-tw": " But what's really amazing is that Ida Tarbell, the journalist, went in and did a big exposé of Rockefeller and actually got the whole antitrust laws put in place. But in many ways, that image of the conspiracy still sticks with us.", "en": " 但真正令人驚訝的是， 井田塔貝爾，一位記者， 深入了解並爆料洛克菲勒 並使得反托拉斯法 到位。 但在許多方面， 這種陰謀仍然與我們同在。"}, {"zh-tw": " And here's one of the things that Ida Tarbell said -- she said, \"He has a thin nose like a thorn. There were no lips.", "en": " 而在這有一件事 開發協會塔貝爾說。 她說：“他有一個很細的鼻子像一根刺。 沒有嘴唇。"}, {"zh-tw": " There were puffs under the little colorless eyes with creases running from them.\" Okay, so that guy is actually still with us. I mean, this is a very pervasive -- this is part of our DNA.", "en": " 有無色的小眼睛 皺摺的運行他們。“ （眾笑） 好了，那傢伙實際上仍然和我們在一起。 （眾笑） 我的意思是，這是一個非常普遍的 - 這是我們的DNA的一部分。"}, {"zh-tw": " And then there's this guy, okay. So, you might be wondering why it is that, every time we have high oil prices or an oil spill, we call these CEOs down to Washington, and we sort of pepper them with questions in public and we try to shame them.", "en": " 然後還有這個傢伙，沒問題。 所以，你可能想知道為什麼它是， 每次我們有高油價或漏油， 我們叫這些老總到華盛頓， 我們與他們在公眾面前談論問題，我們試圖羞辱他們。"}, {"zh-tw": " And this is something that we've been doing since 1974, when we first asked them, \"Why are there these obscene profits?\" And we've sort of personalized the whole oil industry into these CEOs. And we take it as, you know -- we look at it on a moral level, rather than looking at it on a legal and financial level.", "en": " 這些就是我們一直在做的事情，從1947年起 當我們第一次問他們：“為什麼會賺這些黑心錢？” 我們已經有點個性化的石油行業 就在這些CEO。 你知道的，我們把它當作 我們看它在一個道德水平， 而不是看它的法律和財務方面。"}, {"zh-tw": " And so I'm not saying these guys aren't liable to answer questions -- I'm just saying that, when you focus on whether they are or are not a bunch of greedy bastards, you don't actually get around to the point of making laws that are either going to either change the way they operate, or you're going to get around to really reducing the amount of oil and reducing our dependence on oil. So I'm saying this is kind of a distraction.", "en": " 所以我不是說這些人沒有責任回答問題， 我只是想說，當人們關注 無論他們是不是一群貪婪的雜種， 你實際上並不迴避的問題 制定法律要嘛改變運營方式， 否則就會有漏網之魚 真正的石油量減少 並減少對石油的依賴。 所以我說這是一種分散注意力。"}, {"zh-tw": " But it makes for good theater, and it's powerfully cathartic as you probably saw last week. So the thing about water oil spills is that they are very politically galvanizing.", "en": " 這真是一場好戲 它有力的宣洩，你也許看到的最後一周。 因此，對漏油的事件 在政治上是非常狂熱的。"}, {"zh-tw": " I mean, these pictures -- this is from the Santa Barbara spill. You have these pictures of birds.", "en": " 我的意思是，這些照片 - 這是從聖巴巴拉蔓延。 你有這些照片的鳥類。"}, {"zh-tw": " They really influence people. When the Santa Barbara spill happened in 1969, it formed the environmental movement in its modern form.", "en": " 他們真的影響人。 當漏油發生在聖巴巴拉 1969年， 在當時成了最熱門的環保運動。"}, {"zh-tw": " It started Earth Day. It also put in place the National Environmental Policy Act, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act.", "en": " 這就是地球日的由來。 它也設立了國家環境政策法 清潔空氣法案，清潔水法案。"}, {"zh-tw": " Everything that we are really stemmed from this period. I think it's important to kind of look at these pictures of the birds and understand what happens to us.", "en": " 一切真的是源於這個時期。 我認為，重要的是要種看看這些照片的鳥類 並了解其發生在我們身上。"}, {"zh-tw": " Here we are normally; we're standing at the gas pump, and we're feeling kind of helpless.

But it's also really important that we don't get distracted by the theater or the morals of it.", "en": " 這就是為什麼這些時刻，這些漏油 是如此重要。 但我們不要分心也很重要 在看這齣劇或它的道德。"}, {"zh-tw": " We actually need to go in and work on the roots of the problem. One of the things that happened with the two previous oil spills was that we really worked on some of the symptoms.", "en": " 我們實際上需要去 與工作有關的問題的根源。 其中一個發生的事情與前兩次漏油 我們真正的工作是針對一些症狀。"}, {"zh-tw": " We were very reactive, as opposed to being proactive about what happened. And so what we did was, actually, we made moratoriums on the east and west coasts on drilling.", "en": " 我們非常被動的，反對預先處裡 將會發生的事。 我們所做的是， 提出暫停在東部和西部海岸鑽井。"}, {"zh-tw": " We stopped drilling in ANWR, but we didn't actually reduce the amount of oil that we consumed. In fact, it's continued to increase.", "en": " 我們停下來鑽 ANWR， 但實際上我們並未減少石油的消耗量 事實上，消耗量仍持續增加"}, {"zh-tw": " The only thing that really reduces the amount of oil that we consume is much higher prices. As you can see, our own production has fallen off as our reservoirs have gotten old and expensive to drill out.", "en": " 唯一可以真正減少石油消耗量的作法 是將價格抬高 如同您所見到的，我們的產量已經下降 這是因為儲存槽的老化以及昂貴的開採成本"}, {"zh-tw": " We only have two percent of the world's oil reserves; 65 percent of them are in the Persian Gulf.

That has been the equivalent of an Exxon Valdez spill every year since 1969.", "en": " 意思是，這就如同出口石油外洩 當我們從另一個地方進口石油， 而當地又缺乏嚴謹的環境法規 這就如同Exxon Valdez(阿拉斯加港灣漏油事件)一樣 從1969年起，年復一年。"}, {"zh-tw": " And we can wrap our heads around the spills, because that's what we see here, but in fact, these guys actually live in a war zone. There's a thousand battle-related deaths a year in this area twice the size of Maryland, and it's all related to the oil.", "en": " 當然我們清楚了解有關石油外洩的一切 是因為我們在這裡看到了所有相關的資訊。 但事實上，這些人是住在戰區 每年有上千人在這裡死於無情戰火 就在這個面積比馬里蘭州大上兩倍的地區 這些都和石油息息相關"}, {"zh-tw": " And these guys, I mean, if they were in the U.S., they might be actually here in this room.

The other thing that we've done, as we've continued to increase demand, is that we kind of play a shell game with the costs.", "en": " 他們其實是另外一群人 另外一群為我們付出無數代價的人 而另外一件我們所做的事 就是我們持續增加對石油的需求 那就像賭博是需要付出代價的"}, {"zh-tw": " One of the places we put in a big oil project in Chad, with Exxon. So the U.S. taxpayer paid for it; the World Bank, Exxon paid for it.", "en": " 例如在其中一個我們投資了大型石油開採專案的地區 在查德，由Exxon公司負責主導 理所當然，美國納稅人為此專案買單 世界銀行的部分，Exxon則為其支付了所需的款項"}, {"zh-tw": " We put it in.

Now what's happened in the Gulf of Mexico -- as you can see, this is the Minerals Management diagram of wells for gas and oil.", "en": " 還有另外一個同樣支撐著我們對於石油的依賴 以及不斷增加的消耗量的地區 是墨西哥灣 墨西哥灣並不是暫停開採的地區 而現在墨西哥灣發生了什麼事...就如同你所見到的 這是和礦產管理相關 在天然氣氣井以及石油部分的圖表"}, {"zh-tw": " It's become this intense industrialized zone. It doesn't have the same resonance for us that the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge has, but it should, I mean, it's a bird sanctuary.", "en": " 這裡已經變成了密密麻麻的工業區 雖然這和我們之間並沒有任何共同點 但與北極國家野生動物保護區卻有 因為這裡原本應該是個鳥類保護區"}, {"zh-tw": " Also, every time you buy gasoline in the United States, half of it is actually being refined along the coast, because the Gulf actually has about 50 percent of our refining capacity and a lot of our marine terminals as well.

Now on the one hand, the price at the pump is not really very high when you consider the actual cost of the oil, but on the other hand, the fact that people have no other transit options means that they pay a large amount of their income into just getting back and forth to work, generally in a fairly crummy car.", "en": " 但其實每一個美國家庭也需要為石油付出代價 一方面，加油站所制訂的汽油價格並不是太高 我指的是在你考慮了所有與石油相關的成本的情況下 但在另一方面 是因為人們沒有其他的交通方式可選擇 意即這些花費占了收入中的一大部分 但只是為了在工作與回家之間往返 而且通常是使用相當低等的車種"}, {"zh-tw": " If you look at people who make $50,000 a year, they have two kids, they might have three jobs or more, and then they have to really commute.
