And then I spent a year going to long, tedious, boring meetings, trying to sell this logo through to a huge corporation to the point of tears.", "en": " 那是工作的一部分 然而我花了一年的時間 參加長期的、乏味的 無趣的會議 嘗試將這個標誌賣給 一間大公司 賣我的設計"}, {"zh-tw": " I thought I was going to go crazy at the end of this year. We made idiotic presentations showing how the Citi logo made sense, and how it was really derived from an umbrella, and we made animations of these things, and we came back and forth and back and forth and back and forth.", "en": " 我以為一年的折騰就快讓我發瘋了 我們做了個愚蠢的簡報 呈現花旗銀行的標誌是如何的有意義 他是如何確切的從一把傘演變出來的 我們也做了動畫 我們不斷的反反覆覆 反反覆覆 反反覆覆"}, {"zh-tw": " And it was worth it, because they bought this thing, and it played out on such a grand scale, and it's so internationally recognizable, but for me it was actually a very, very depressing year. As a matter of fact, they actually never bought onto the logo until Fallon put it on its very good \"Live Richly\" campaign, and then everybody accepted it all over the world.", "en": " 這一切都很值得 因為他們買下了這商標 且發揮了非常重要的功用 這非常國際化且具辨認性 但是實際上對我而言是個非常令人沮喪的一年 事實上 他們從未買過商標 直到Fallon 直接用了它 在很棒的“富有地生活”推案 然後全世界的每個人都接受"}, {"zh-tw": " So during this time I needed some kind of counterbalance for this crazy, crazy existence of going to these long, idiotic meetings. And I was up in my country house, and for some reason, I began painting these very big, very involved, laborious, complicated maps of the entire world, and listing every place on the planet, and putting them in, and misspelling them, and putting things in the wrong spot, and completely controlling the information, and going totally and completely nuts with it.", "en": " 因此在這段期間我需要 一種平衡 為這瘋狂，瘋狂的事實 參加這些冗長愚蠢的會議 而我在我鄉下的家醒來 基於某些原因 我開始繪製 這些非常龐大 非常混亂 吃力 複雜的 世界地圖 且列出這星球上的每一個地方然後將他們畫進去 再拼錯地名然後將他們放進錯誤的地方 完全的控制資訊 我完完全全的為此著迷"}, {"zh-tw": " They would take me about six months initially, but then I started getting faster at it.

And I -- they started to become more political, and I picked areas that sort of were in the news or that I had some feeling about, and I began doing these things. And then this funny thing happened.", "en": " 因此 兩年後畫廊希望我 有另外一場展出 這意思是要我 必須畫這些畫 用比以往 更快速的速度來完成 而我 將這些畫變的越來越政治化 我選擇的地域 有來自於新聞的 或者我對那些地方有些感覺 我開始做這些事情 然後有趣的事情發生了"}, {"zh-tw": " I found that I was no longer at play.
