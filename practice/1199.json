Families need the help.", "en": " 沒有任何的爭論 這很激勵人心 這些家庭需要幫助"}, {"zh-tw": " And we find that if we keep girls in school later, they'll stay in school until they're 16, and won't get married if there's food in school.

What if from the women in Africa who cannot sell any food -- there's no roads, there's no warehouses, there's not even a tarp to pick the food up with -- what if we give the enabling environment for them to provide the food to feed the hungry children elsewhere?
