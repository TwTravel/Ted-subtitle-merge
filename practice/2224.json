My right eye was removed at seven months of age.", "en": " （滴答聲） 我出生時就患有雙眼視網膜 母細胞瘤。 在我七個月大時 我的右眼被移除。"}, {"zh-tw": " I was 13 monthswhen they removed my left eye. The first thing I didupon awakening from that last surgery was to climb out of my crib and begin wandering aroundthe intensive care nursery, probably looking for the onewho did this to me.", "en": " 13 個月大時他們把我的左眼移除了。 我從最後一個手術後醒來所做的第一件事是 爬出我的嬰兒床 開始在重症監護嬰兒室裡亂逛， 可能是在找那個把我弄成失明的人。"}, {"zh-tw": " Evidently, wandering around the nursery was not a problem for me without eyes. The problem was getting caught.", "en": " 顯然地，在嬰兒室裡亂逛 對於沒有雙眼的我來說並不是問題。 問題是被抓住。"}, {"zh-tw": " It's impressions about blindness that are far more threatening to blind people than the blindness itself. Think for a moment aboutyour own impressions of blindness.", "en": " 對失明的印象 遠比失明本身 讓盲人更恐懼。 想一下你自己對失明的印象。"}, {"zh-tw": " Think about your reactionswhen I first came onto the stage, or the prospect of your own blindness, or a loved one going blind. The terror is incomprehensibleto most of us, because blindness is thought to epitomize ignoranceand unawareness, hapless exposure to the ravagesof the dark unknown.", "en": " 想一下當我剛上台時你的反應， 想一下你自己失明， 或者愛的人將失明的景象。 對我們大多數人來說恐懼難以想象， 因為失明被認為是 無知和無意識的縮影， 不幸地受到未知黑暗的折磨。"}, {"zh-tw": " How poetic. Fortunately for me,my parents were not poetic.", "en": " 多麼詩意啊。 對我來說幸運的是，我的父母沒有充滿詩意。"}, {"zh-tw": " They were pragmatic. They understood that ignorance and fearwere but matters of the mind, and the mind is adaptable.", "en": " 他們很務實。 他們明白無知和恐懼僅僅是思想層面的問題， 並且思想是可以改變的。"}, {"zh-tw": " They believed that I should grow up to enjoy the same freedomsand responsibilities as everyone else. In their own words, I would move out -- which I did when I was 18 -- I will pay taxes -- thanks -- -- and they knew the differencebetween love and fear.", "en": " 他們認為我會長大 享受和其他人一樣的自由與責任。 用他們的話來說，我會搬出去住， 我 18 歲時做了這事， 我要繳稅。 謝謝 他們知道愛和恐懼之間的區別。"}, {"zh-tw": " Fear immobilizes usin the face of challenge. They knew that blindnesswould pose a significant challenge.", "en": " 面對挑戰的時候恐懼使我們無法移動。 他們知道失明會構成重大的挑戰。"}, {"zh-tw": " I was not raised with fear. They put my freedom first before all else, because that is what love does.", "en": " 我並不是在恐懼中長大。 他們把我的自由看得比其他東西都重要， 因為那就是愛才會這麼做。"}, {"zh-tw": " Now, moving forward,how do I manage today? The world is a much larger nursery.

It will keep me, for example, from making an undignified departure from the stage.", "en": " 我把它叫做我的自由幫手。 例如，它能阻止我， 不體面地離開講台。"}, {"zh-tw": " I do see that cliff edge. They warned us earlierthat every imaginable mishap has occurred to speakersup here on the stage.", "en": " 我確實看到講台邊緣。 他們之前提醒我 演講者在台上遇到過各種事故，"}, {"zh-tw": " I don't care to set a new precedent.

And my brain, thanks to my parents, has been activated to form imagesin my visual cortex, which we now call the imaging system, from those patterns of information,much as your brain does.", "en": " 那些是聲音的反射 從我身邊事物的表面反射出去， 就像蝙蝠的聲納， 把圖案和資訊傳回給我， 就像光反射給你們圖案和資訊一樣。 感謝我的父母， 我的大腦得到啟動在視覺皮層裡形成圖像， 我們現在把它叫做成像系統， 藉助資訊的結構形成圖像，就像你們的大腦。"}, {"zh-tw": " I call this process flash sonar. It is how I have learned to seethrough my blindness, to navigate my journey through the dark unknownsof my own challenges, which has earned me the moniker \"the remarkable Batman.\" Now, Batman I will accept.", "en": " 我稱這個過程為「閃光聲納」。 我就是這樣學會在失明中看見東西， 透過自我挑戰未知的黑暗 駕馭我的旅程， 我因此得了一個綽號 「神奇蝙蝠俠」。 我接受「蝙蝠俠」這個綽號。"}, {"zh-tw": " Bats are cool. Batman is cool. But I was not raised to think of myselfas in any way remarkable.", "en": " 蝙蝠很酷。蝙蝠俠也很酷。 但是在成長的過程中我不覺得自己在哪方面是奇特的。"}, {"zh-tw": " I have always regarded myselfmuch like anyone else who navigates the dark unknownsof their own challenges. Is that so remarkable? I do not use my eyes, I use my brain.", "en": " 我總是把自己看得和其它人一樣 他們也是在駕馭挑戰性的未知黑暗。 那很奇特嗎？ 我不用眼睛，我用我的大腦。"}, {"zh-tw": " Now, someone, somewhere, must think that's remarkable,or I wouldn't be up here, but let's consider this for a moment. Everyone out there who faces or who has everfaced a challenge, raise your hands.", "en": " 此時某地的某人， 一定覺得那很奇特，否則我不會在這裡， 但是我們思考一下。 這裡的每一個人 面臨或曾經面臨過挑戰的， 舉起你們的手。"}, {"zh-tw": " Whoosh. Okay. Lots of hands going up, a moment,let me do a head count.", "en": " 呼。 好的。 好多手舉起來，等一下，我來數數。"}, {"zh-tw": " (Clicking) This will take a while.(Clicking) Okay, lots of hands in the air. Keep them up. I have an idea.", "en": " （滴答聲） 這需要一會兒。（滴答聲） 好，空中有好多手。 一直舉着。我有一個主意。"}, {"zh-tw": " Those of you who use your brainsto navigate these challenges, put your hands down. Okay, anyone with your hands still up has challenges of your own.", "en": " 那些用大腦來克服挑戰的人， 放下你們的手。 好的，還舉着手的人 面臨著自身的挑戰。"}, {"zh-tw": " So we all face challenges, and we all face the dark unknown, which is endemic to most challenges,which is what most of us fear, okay? But we all have brains that allow us, that activate to allow us to navigate the journeythrough these challenges. Okay? Case in point: I came up here and -- (Clicking) -- they wouldn't tell me where the lectern was. So you can't trust those TED folks.", "en": " 我們都面臨著挑戰， 我們都面臨著未知的黑暗， 大多數挑戰普遍是這樣，我們大多數人都害怕，對嗎？ 但我們都有大腦 大腦得到啟動 讓我們在這些挑戰中駕馭旅程。好嗎？ 一個很好的例子：我來到這裡 （滴答聲） 他們不告訴我講台在哪裡。 你們不能相信 TED 的工作人員。"}, {"zh-tw": " \"Find it yourself,\" they said. So -- And the feedback for the P.A. systemis no help at all.", "en": " 他們說.：「自己找」， 而且廣播系統的反饋根本沒有幫助。"}, {"zh-tw": " So now I present to you a challenge. So if you'd all close your eyesfor just a moment, okay? And you're going to learna bit of flash sonar.", "en": " 現在我向你們展現一個挑戰。 你們都閉上眼睛一會兒，好嗎？ 你們將要學一點閃光聲納。"}, {"zh-tw": " I'm going to make a sound. I'm going to hold this panel in front of me, but I'm not going to move it.", "en": " 我準備弄出聲響。 我會在我的前面舉着這塊平板但不會移動這塊板。"}, {"zh-tw": " Just listen to the sound for a moment. Shhhhhhhhhh.", "en": " 聽一會兒我發出的聲音。 噓噓噓噓。"}, {"zh-tw": " Okay, nothing very interesting. Now, listen to what happensto that same exact sound when I move the panel.", "en": " 好吧，沒什麼有趣的。 現在，我移動平板 聽聽同樣的聲音會有什麼變化。"}, {"zh-tw": " Shhhhhhhhhhh. (Pitch getting higher and lower) You do not know the powerof the dark side. I couldn't resist.", "en": " 噓噓噓噓。（音調時高時低） 你們不知道黑暗的力量。 我情不自禁。"}, {"zh-tw": " Okay, now keep your eyes closed because, did you hear the difference? Okay. Now, let's be sure. For your challenge, you tell me, just say \"now\"when you hear the panel start to move.", "en": " 好的，現在閉上你們的眼睛， 你們聽到差別了嗎？ 好的，讓我們來確認一下。 你們的挑戰是， 當我開始移動平板時你們就要告訴我「現在」。"}, {"zh-tw": " Okay? We'll relax into this. Shhhhhhh.", "en": " 好嗎？放鬆。 噓噓噓噓。"}, {"zh-tw": " Audience: Now.Daniel Kish: Good. Excellent. Open your eyes.", "en": " 觀眾：現在。丹尼爾·基什：好的。很棒。 睜開眼睛。"}, {"zh-tw": " All right. So just a few centimeters, you would notice the difference. You've experienced sonar.", "en": " 好。只移動了幾厘米， 你們可以注意到這種變化。 你們已經感受到聲納了。"}, {"zh-tw": " You'd all make great blind people. Let's have a look at what can happen when this activation process is given some time and attention.", "en": " 你們都變成了不起的盲人。 我們來看看 當給予啟動過程一些時間和關注 會發生什麼。"}, {"zh-tw": " (Video) Juan Ruiz: It's likeyou guys can see with your eyes and we can see with our ears. Brian Bushway: It's not a matterof enjoying it more or less, it's about enjoying it differently.", "en": " （影片）胡安·鲁伊斯：就像你們可以用眼睛去看 我們可以用耳朵去看。 布萊恩·布施威：這不是欣賞多與少的問題， 而是從不同角度欣賞的問題。"}, {"zh-tw": " Shawn Marsolais: It goes across.DK: Yeah. SM: And then it's graduallycoming back down again.", "en": " 尚恩·瑪索萊斯：穿過了。丹尼爾·基什：是的。 尚恩·瑪索萊斯：接着它逐漸再往下走。"}, {"zh-tw": " DK: Yes!SM: That's amazing. I can, like, see the car. Holy mother! J. Louchart: I love being blind.", "en": " 丹尼爾·基什：對！尚恩·瑪索萊斯：好神奇。 我可以看到汽車。聖母馬利亞！ J. 盧沙爾：我喜歡當盲人。"}, {"zh-tw": " If I had the opportunity, honestly,I wouldn't go back to being sighted. JR: The bigger the goal,the more obstacles you'll face, and on the other side of that goal is victory.", "en": " 說實話，如果有機會我不打算重見光明了。 JR：目標越大，你面臨的障礙越多， 在目標的另一邊 是勝利。"}, {"zh-tw": " [In Italian] DK: Now, do these people look terrified? Not so much. We have delivered activation training to tens of thousands of blindand sighted people from all backgrounds in nearly 40 countries.", "en": " （意大利語） 丹尼爾·基什：這些人看上去很害怕嗎？ 不是很害怕。 我們把激活訓練傳授給 成千上萬的盲人以及來自各種背景的有視力的人 遍及 40 個國家。"}, {"zh-tw": " When blind people learn to see, sighted people seem inspired to want to learn to see their waybetter, more clearly, with less fear, because this exemplifiesthe immense capacity within us all to navigate any type of challenge,through any form of darkness, to discoveries unimagined when we are activated. I wish you all a most activating journey.", "en": " 當盲人學會看見， 有視力的人似乎受到啟發 想要學會更好更清晰沒那麼畏懼地看清他們的路， 因為這證明了我們巨大的能力 在任何黑暗中，駕馭任何一種類型的挑戰， 發現無法想象的東西 只要我們受到激活。 我希望你們擁有一個激勵的旅程。"}, {"zh-tw": " Thank you very much. Chris Anderson: Daniel, my friend.", "en": " 非常感謝大家。 克里斯·安德森：丹尼爾，我的朋友。"}, {"zh-tw": " As I know you can see, it'sa spectacular standing ovation at TED. Thank you for an extraordinary talk.", "en": " 我知道你看得到，TED 觀眾的熱烈的掌聲。 謝謝你出色的演講。"}, {"zh-tw": " Just one more question about your world,your inner world that you construct. We think that we have things in our worldthat you as a blind person don't have, but what's your world like? What do you have that we don't have? DK: Three hundred and sixty-degree view, so my sonar works about as wellbehind me as it does in front of me.", "en": " 還有一個問題關於你所建立的內心世界。 我們認為在我們的世界中我們擁有你們盲人沒有的事物， 但是你們的世界是怎樣的？ 你們擁有我們所沒有的東西是什麼？ 丹尼爾·基什：360 度視角， 我的聲納在身後也像身前一樣有用。"}, {"zh-tw": " It works around corners. It works through surfaces.", "en": " 在角落處也管用。 它可以穿過表面"}, {"zh-tw": " Generally, it's kind of a fuzzythree-dimensional geometry. One of my students, who has nowbecome an instructor, when he lost his vision,after a few months he was sitting in his three story house and he realized that he could heareverything going on throughout the house: conversations, people in the kitchen,people in the bathroom, several floors away, several walls away.", "en": " 總而言之，這是一個模糊的三維幾何世界。 我有一個學生，現在是名教員， 當他失明幾個月後， 他坐在三層樓高的家裡 意識到他能聽到屋裡正在發生的一切東西： 對話，廚房和浴室裡的人們 幾層樓之外，幾牆之隔。"}, {"zh-tw": " He said it was somethinglike having x-ray vision. CA: What do you picturethat you're in right now? How do you picture this theater? DK: Lots of loudspeakers, quite frankly.", "en": " 他說就像擁有 X 射線一樣的視力。 安德森·丹尼爾：你怎樣描繪現在身處的地方？ 你怎樣描述這個劇院？ 丹尼爾·基什：坦白說，很多大聲說話的人。"}, {"zh-tw": " It's interesting. When people make a sound, when they laugh, when they fidget,when they take a drink or blow their nose or whatever, I hear everything. I hear every little movementthat every single person makes.", "en": " 很有趣。當人們發出聲音， 當他們笑，當他們坐立不安當他們喝飲料或者擤鼻子 不管是做什麼，我都能聽到。 我聽到每個人做出的細微動作。"}, {"zh-tw": " None of it really escapes my attention, and then, from a sonar perspective, the size of the room, the curvature of the audience around the stage, it's the height of the room. Like I say, it's all that kind of three-dimensional surface geometry all around me.", "en": " 它們都沒能逃過我的注意， 從聲納的角度來說， 房間的大小，觀眾繞講台的曲率， 房間的高度。 就像我說的，這是環繞我的是 三維平面幾何世界。"}, {"zh-tw": " CA: Well, Daniel, you have donea spectacular job of helping us all see the worldin a different way. Thanks so much for that, truly.DK: Thank you.", "en": " 安德森·丹尼爾：丹尼爾，你的演講很棒， 幫助我們從一個不同的方式來看世界。 真誠地感謝你。丹尼爾·基什：謝謝。"}], "title": "Daniel Kish How I Use Sonar To Navigate The World"}
