Will only those that are able to afford it be able to be this super race of the future? So the big question for us is, \"How do we manage this technological change?\" How do we ensure that it creates a more inclusive technology, a technology which means that not only as we grow older, that we can also grow wiser, and that we're able to support the populations of the future? One of the most dramatic manifestations of these improvements will be moving from population pyramids to what we might term population coffins.", "en": " 我們有能力把老鼠的基因改造 (比火車頭還厲害？超級鼠 vs 一般鼠) 讓牠跑得比一般老鼠快三倍 (後面：一般鼠 前面：超級鼠) (時速：20公尺/分鐘) 壽命比一般老鼠長三倍 活到相當於人類80歲的年齡 卻只要用同樣份量的食物餵養 (一般鼠出局) (總距離：0.2公里) 但是 能享受這些益處的 只有富人嗎？ 這是新的優生學嗎？ 只有那些負擔得起的人 能在未來成為超級種族嗎？(一小時後 超級鼠耐力依舊...) 所以當前最大的問題是 「我們如何因應科技上的改變？」 我們如何確保 在未來 能有人人可利用的科技 這樣的科技 不只在我們年歲漸長時 (人口老化是歐洲的最大問題) 讓我們更有智慧 也讓我們有能力 扶養未來的人口 眾多進步中 最顯著的例子 就是人口金字塔 (1950到2030年義大利人口結構圖) 可能會變成所謂的人口棺材"}, {"zh-tw": " There is unlikely to be a pension or a retirement age in 2030.
