And here's the result.", "en": " 所以,為了試驗這個想法, 我們研究了胺基酸和其他的羧酸。 這就是結果。"}, {"zh-tw": " Here is, in fact, what you get if you, for example, lookat the distribution of amino acids on a comet or in interstellar spaceor, in fact, in a laboratory, where you made very surethat in your primordial soup, there is no living stuff in there.
