Are we as a culture going to start to value knowledge less? As somebody who has always believed in the importance of the stuff that we know, this was a terrifying idea to me.", "en": " 結果，大腦中具有該功能的那部份 變小變遲鈍了。 這也使得我思考，如果計算機 的理解和記憶功能比人類更強大會怎樣？ 我們的大腦是否都會像那樣萎縮呢？ 人類文明是否會開始輕視知識的價值？ 作為一個堅信知識力量的人， 這對我來說太可怕了。"}, {"zh-tw": " The more I thought about it, I realized, no, it's still important. The things we know are still important.", "en": " 我越想就越發現，不，這依然重要。 我們的知識依然重要。"}, {"zh-tw": " I came to believe there were two advantages that those of us who have these things in our head have over somebody who says, \"Oh, yeah. I can Google that. Hold on a second.\" There's an advantage of volume, and there's an advantage of time. The advantage of volume, first, just has to do with the complexity of the world nowadays.", "en": " 我相信有兩大優勢 是我們這些用腦記知識的人有 而那些只會說“哦對，我可以google，等我一下“的人沒有的。 一是資訊量的優勢，二是時間的優勢。 首先，資訊量的優勢 與如今複雜的世界有關。"}, {"zh-tw": " There's so much information out there.

This is terrifying because a lot of the big decisions we make require the mastery of lots of different kinds of facts.", "en": " 並且每18個月就會多一倍。 這很駭人因為我們許多重要的決定 都是基於多各種資訊的掌握之上。"}, {"zh-tw": " A decision like where do I go to school? What should I major in? Who do I vote for? Do I take this job or that one? These are the decisions that require correct judgments about many different kinds of facts.

Screw it.\" And you'll make a less informed decision.", "en": " 如果你連第一步都做不到， 你真會去查其他幾千條你需要知道的資訊 來掌握美國外交政策嗎？ 這不大可能。 某一刻，你會說 ”算了，要知道的實在太多了，管它的。“ 這樣你的決定就不那麼明智了。"}, {"zh-tw": " The other issue is the advantage of time that you have if you have all these things at your fingertips.
