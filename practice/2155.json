So this was the challenge facedby this man, Arthur Samuel."}, {"zh-tw": "他在 1956 年便想到用這台電腦能夠在西洋跳棋棋賽打敗他。要如何設計這樣的程式？把細節通通寫出來，如何讓電腦比你還會下棋？於是他想出了一個點子：他讓電腦與電腦本身對弈數千次以學習如何玩西洋棋。", "en": "In 1956, he wanted to get this computer to be able to beat him at checkers. How can you write a program, lay out in excruciating detail,how to be better than you at checkers? So he came up with an idea: he had the computer playagainst itself thousands of times and learn how to play checkers."}, {"zh-tw": "然而，在 1962 年做到了，電腦打敗了康乃狄克州的冠軍。於是亞瑟·撒姆爾成為了機器學習之父，我尊敬他，因為我也是個機器學習實踐者，", "en": "And indeed it worked,and in fact, by 1962, this computer had beatenthe Connecticut state champion.

So computers can also write."}, {"zh-tw": "我們把這些都放在一起，讓它來引導到一個令人振奮的時機。像在藥物方面，一個波士頓的團隊宣佈他們發現了數十種腫瘤的臨床特徵幫助醫生預測癌症。", "en": "So we put all this together and it leadsto very exciting opportunities. For example, in medicine, a team in Boston announcedthat they had discovered dozens of new clinically relevant features of tumors which help doctorsmake a prognosis of a cancer."}, {"zh-tw": "同樣的，在史丹佛，一個組織宣佈在放大鏡下觀察組織，他們開發一個以機器學習為基礎的系統比人類病理學家更有效地預測癌症病患的生存率。這些例子，不但能更準確地預測，而且也能帶來更多科技上的洞見。", "en": "Very similarly, in Stanford, a group there announced that,looking at tissues under magnification, they've developed a machine learning-based system which in fact is betterthan human pathologists at predicting survival ratesfor cancer sufferers. In both of these cases, not onlywere the predictions more accurate, but they generated new insightful science."}, {"zh-tw": "在放射學的個案中，他們是人類所能理解的新臨床指標。在這病理學個案，電腦系統發現癌症周圍的細胞在診斷的時候是跟癌細胞一樣重要。", "en": "In the radiology case, they were new clinical indicatorsthat humans can understand. In this pathology case, the computer system actually discoveredthat the cells around the cancer are as important asthe cancer cells themselves in making a diagnosis."}, {"zh-tw": "這跟病理學家10 年來的說法相反。在這兩個個案，系統的開發人員是由醫學專家和機器學習專家所組成，但自去年開始，我們也超越了這些。", "en": "This is the opposite of what pathologistshad been taught for decades. In each of those two cases,they were systems developed by a combination of medical expertsand machine learning experts, but as of last year,we're now beyond that too."}, {"zh-tw": "這是確認癌症範圍的例子是在顯微鏡下的人類組織。系統顯示可以更準確地確認範圍，如病理學家般準確，不過沒有藥物專家來建構整套深度學習系統系統是由一些沒有專業背景的人完成。", "en": "This is an example ofidentifying cancerous areas of human tissue under a microscope. The system being shown herecan identify those areas more accurately, or about as accurately,as human pathologists, but was built entirely with deep learningusing no medical expertise by people who haveno background in the field."}, {"zh-tw": "同樣地，從是細胞分裂。我們的系統可以像人類般精確地分裂神經細胞，不過開發這套深度學習系統沒有一個人來自醫學背景。", "en": "Similarly, here, this neuron segmentation. We can now segment neuronsabout as accurately as humans can, but this system was developedwith deep learning using people with no previous background in medicine."}, {"zh-tw": "就是我和一些沒有醫學背景的人，看來我頗有資格開一家醫藥公司。我確實這麼做了。我是以戒慎恐懼的心情開始做，不過理論顯示這是可行的用這些資料分析技術來製作有效的藥物。", "en": "So myself, as somebody withno previous background in medicine, I seem to be entirely well qualifiedto start a new medical company, which I did. I was kind of terrified of doing it, but the theory seemed to suggestthat it ought to be possible to do very useful medicineusing just these data analytic techniques."}, {"zh-tw": "感恩的是回應也挺不錯，這回應不只是來自媒體，而且還有醫藥社群，他們都很支持。理論上我們能在醫務過程中盡量轉換成資料分析，讓醫生去做他們擅長的。", "en": "And thankfully, the feedbackhas been fantastic, not just from the mediabut from the medical community, who have been very supportive. The theory is that we can takethe middle part of the medical process and turn that into data analysisas much as possible, leaving doctors to dowhat they're best at."}, {"zh-tw": "我舉一個例子。我們現在花 15 分鐘來創造一項新的醫學診斷測試我會讓你同步看到過程，不過我已刪除部分資料壓縮成三分鐘。", "en": "I want to give you an example. It now takes us about 15 minutesto generate a new medical diagnostic test and I'll show you that in real time now, but I've compressed it down to three minutes by cutting some pieces out."}, {"zh-tw": "我不會向你們展示創造出來的醫學診斷測試，我要向你們展示一項汽車圖片的診斷測試，因為這個我們都能理解。我們從 150 萬張的汽車圖片開始，我希望創造一些東西把圖片分類而且依圖片拍攝的角度來分類。", "en": "Rather than showing youcreating a medical diagnostic test, I'm going to show you a diagnostic test of car images, because that's somethingwe can all understand.

With our deep learning algorithm, it can automatically identifyareas of structure in these images."}, {"zh-tw": "美好的是人和電腦可以合作看看這裡，這個人，正在告訴電腦關於感興趣的範圍而電腦會嘗試用它來改善電腦的演算法。", "en": "So the nice thing is that the humanand the computer can now work together. So the human, as you can see here, is telling the computerabout areas of interest which it wants the computer thento try and use to improve its algorithm."}, {"zh-tw": "這些深度學習系統有 16,000 個立體空間，你可以看見電腦讓他們在這空間旋轉，嘗試找出新的區域結構。當它成功時，在開車的人能夠指出有興趣的地方。", "en": "Now, these deep learning systems actuallyare in 16,000-dimensional space, so you can see here the computerrotating this through that space, trying to find new areas of structure.

So as we go through this process, we're gradually tellingthe computer more and more about the kinds of structureswe're looking for."}, {"zh-tw": "你可以想像一個診斷測試像是一個病理學家辨認病症的範圍，或是放射治療師界定潛在的腫瘤。有些時候對演算法來說是有些困難。", "en": "You can imagine in a diagnostic test this would be a pathologist identifyingareas of pathosis, for example, or a radiologist indicatingpotentially troublesome nodules. And sometimes it can bedifficult for the algorithm."}, {"zh-tw": "在我們這個例子，它會出現混亂。汽車的正面和背面都混淆不清了。", "en": "In this case, it got kind of confused. The fronts and the backsof the cars are all mixed up."}, {"zh-tw": "我們需要更小心，手動選出正面跟背面有相反效果的文字，然後告知電腦這是一種我們有興趣的一類。這要花了一些時間來做，所以我們跳過，然後我們訓練機器學習演算法以好幾百張圖片去訓練它，我們希望它會做得更好。", "en": "So here we have to be a bit more careful, manually selecting these frontsas opposed to the backs, then telling the computerthat this is a type of group that we're interested in. So we do that for a while,we skip over a little bit, and then we train themachine learning algorithm based on these couple of hundred things, and we hope that it's gotten a lot better."}, {"zh-tw": "你可以看見，它開始刪除一些圖片，顯示它已經知道可以自己理解這些圖片。我們運用相似圖片的概念，用類似的圖片，你可以看到，電腦現在可以完全找到正面的汽車。", "en": "You can see, it's now started to fadesome of these pictures out, showing us that it already is recognizinghow to understand some of these itself. We can then use this conceptof similar images, and using similar images, you can now see, the computer at this point is able toentirely find just the fronts of cars."}, {"zh-tw": "這時，人類可以告訴電腦，對，你做的很好。當然，有些時候，即使在這個階段分組仍然是困難的。", "en": "So at this point, the humancan tell the computer, okay, yes, you've donea good job of that. Sometimes, of course, even at this point it's still difficultto separate out groups."}, {"zh-tw": "在這情況，儘管我們讓電腦嘗試旋轉圖片一陣子，我們還是發現左邊和右邊的圖片是混淆在一起的。於是我們再次給電腦一些提示，像是嘗試去發現一個計畫可以儘量區分出左邊和右邊的圖片是透過使用深度學習演算法。", "en": "In this case, even after we let thecomputer try to rotate this for a while, we still find that the left sidesand the right sides pictures are all mixed up together.

It's managed to find a wayof thinking about these objects that's separated out these together."}, {"zh-tw": "你現在知道了。這並不是電腦取代人類，而是兩者一起合作。", "en": "So you get the idea here. This is a case not where the humanis being replaced by a computer, but where they're working together."}, {"zh-tw": "我們在做的事情是在過去需要5 或 6 個人花 7 年時間完成的事情現在只需一個人15 分鐘來完成。這個過程需要重覆 4 或 5 次。", "en": "What we're doing here is we're replacingsomething that used to take a team of five or six people about seven years and replacing it with somethingthat takes 15 minutes for one person acting alone.

And at this point, wecan start to quite quickly grab whole big sections, check through them to make surethat there's no mistakes."}, {"zh-tw": "有錯誤，我們可以讓電腦知道錯誤的地方。每一個不同的分類我們都使用這種程序來做，我們現在在分辨 150 萬張的圖片時有超過 80％ 的成功率，", "en": "Where there are mistakes, we canlet the computer know about them. And using this kind of processfor each of the different groups, we are now up toan 80 percent success rate in classifying the 1.5 million images."}, {"zh-tw": "現在，在這個案例找到少數幾個不正確的分類，讓電腦了解原因。用這種方法，15 分鐘就有 97％ 的分辨率。", "en": "And at this point, it's just a case of finding the small numberthat aren't classified correctly, and trying to understand why.

Well, it'll be fine.They'll be replaced by other jobs. For example, there will bemore jobs for data scientists."}, {"zh-tw": "不過，這不完全正確。數據科學家不需要花很久的時間去做這些事情。", "en": "Well, not really. It doesn't take data scientists very long to build these things."}, {"zh-tw": "例如，這四個演算法是同一個人設計的。若你認為這些以前都發生過，過去我們看過新事物出現的結果他們被新的職務所取替，那些新的職業會是什麼呢？我們很難去判斷，因為人類的能力以這個速度逐漸成長，我們現在有了深度學習系統，我們知道以指數的方式增長。", "en": "For example, these four algorithmswere all built by the same guy. So if you think, oh, it's all happened before, we've seen the results in the pastof when new things come along and they get replaced by new jobs, what are these new jobs going to be? It's very hard for us to estimate this, because human performancegrows at this gradual rate, but we now have a system, deep learning, that we know actually growsin capability exponentially."}, {"zh-tw": "我們在這裡。最近，我們看周圍的事物會說：電腦還是很笨，不是嗎？但是在五年內，電腦將會超越這張圖表。", "en": "And we're here.
