Well, it'll be fine.They'll be replaced by other jobs. For example, there will bemore jobs for data scientists.", "en": " 這意味什麼？ 那可好。他們將會被其他的職業取代。 舉例：需要更多科學家來工作。"}, {"zh-tw": " Well, not really. It doesn't take data scientists very long to build these things.", "en": " 不過，這不完全正確。 數據科學家不需要花很久的時間去做這些事情。"}, {"zh-tw": " For example, these four algorithmswere all built by the same guy. So if you think, oh, it's all happened before, we've seen the results in the pastof when new things come along and they get replaced by new jobs, what are these new jobs going to be? It's very hard for us to estimate this, because human performancegrows at this gradual rate, but we now have a system, deep learning, that we know actually growsin capability exponentially.", "en": " 例如，這四個演算法是同一個人設計的。 若你認為這些以前都發生過， 過去我們看過新事物出現的結果 他們被新的職務所取替， 那些新的職業會是什麼呢？ 我們很難去判斷， 因為人類的能力以這個速度逐漸成長， 我們現在有了深度學習系統， 我們知道以指數的方式增長。"}, {"zh-tw": " And we're here.
