In fact, the better I do my job, the more people hate me. And no, I'm not a meter maid, and I'm not an undertaker."}, {"zh-tw": "我是一個積極進取的女同志常常在Fox News上發表評論你們都聽到了吧? 我只是想確認一下 對吧?我是一個在Fox News常常發表評論的女同志", "en": "I am a progressive, lesbiantalking head on Fox News. So y'all heard that, right?Just to make sure, right? I am a gay talking head on Fox News."}, {"zh-tw": "我會告訴大家我怎麼做到的和我所學到最重要的事所以我上電視", "en": "I am going to tell you how I do it, and the most important thing I've learned. So I go on television."}, {"zh-tw": "我和那些簡直要磨沒我所有堅信的事物，有時，甚至是不希望不喜歡我存在的人辯論那就像是感恩節和你保守的叔叔在爭論外加數十萬的現場電視觀眾", "en": "I debate people who literally wantto obliterate everything I believe in -- in some cases, who don't wantme and people like me to even exist. It's sort of like Thanksgivingwith your conservative uncle on steroids, with a live televisionaudience of millions."}, {"zh-tw": "就像那個樣子在剛剛開播的時候", "en": "It's totally almost just like that. And that's just on air."}, {"zh-tw": "我收到的仇視郵件已經讓人難以置信僅僅上週，我收到了238封骯髒的郵件更多的數不清的推特", "en": "The hate mail I get is unbelievable. Last week alone, I got 238pieces of nasty email and more hate tweetsthan I can even count."}, {"zh-tw": "我被稱為傻瓜、叛徒、禍害、騙子、醜惡的人僅僅在一封郵件裡（笑）所以我意識到作為這些醜惡的最終接受者我最大的收穫在於，幾十年來我們一直關注與政治正確但是真正關鍵的是感情正確", "en": "I was called an idiot,a traitor, a scourge, a cunt and an ugly man, and that was just in one email. So what have I realized, being on the receiving endof all this ugliness? Well, my biggest takeaway is that for decades, we've been focusedon political correctness, but what matters moreis emotional correctness."}, {"zh-tw": "讓我舉一個小例子我不介意你稱呼我女同性戀。我真的不在乎。", "en": "Let me give you a small example. I don't care if you call me a dyke.I really don't."}, {"zh-tw": "我在乎兩個事情。其一，我在乎你正確的拼寫了它。（笑）（鼓掌）", "en": "I care about two things. One, I care that you spell it right."}, {"zh-tw": "快速複習，是D-Y-K-E。你會完全吃驚的。", "en": "Just quick refresher, it's D-Y-K-E. You'd totally be surprised."}, {"zh-tw": "其二，我不在乎這個詞，我在乎你怎麼運用它。你是表現友善嗎？你只是天真嗎？亦或，你真的希望傷害我的個人感情？情感正確是那種語氣，感覺，我們如何表達我們的語言我們互相表現的尊敬和同情", "en": "And second, I don't care about the word,I care about how you use it. Are you being friendly?Are you just being naive? Or do you really wantto hurt me personally? Emotional correctnessis the tone, the feeling, how we say what we say, the respect and compassionwe show one another."}, {"zh-tw": "我發現政治說服力並不起源於想法或事實或數據政治說服力開始於正確的情感", "en": "And what I've realizedis that political persuasion doesn't begin with ideas or facts or data. Political persuasion beginswith being emotionally correct."}, {"zh-tw": "所以，當我第一次在Fox News工作，真心的懺悔我期望地毯上會有暗號在總多環環相扣的圖案裏那，順便說，期望引起你的注意不是感情正確的", "en": "So when I first wentto go work at Fox News, true confession, I expected there to be marks in the carpet from all the knuckle-dragging. That, by the way, in case you're payingattention, is not emotionally correct."}, {"zh-tw": "但是自由主義者是站在我這邊的我們可以自以為是，我們可以自滿我們可以忽略其他不認可我們的人換言之，我們可以是政治正確的但是感情錯誤的", "en": "But liberals on my side, we can be self-righteous,we can be condescending, we can be dismissive of anyonewho doesn't agree with us. In other words, we canbe politically right but emotionally wrong."}, {"zh-tw": "順帶的，那意味著人們不喜歡我們。是不是？現在，踢場者來了保守主義者真的很友善", "en": "And incidentally, that means thatpeople don't like us. Right? Now here's the kicker. Conservatives are really nice."}, {"zh-tw": "我的意思是，不是他們的所有人不是發送給我仇恨郵件的人你會驚訝的Sean Hannity是我見過的", "en": "I mean, not all of them, and not the ones who send me hate mail, but you would be surprised. Sean Hannity is one ofthe sweetest guys I've ever met."}, {"zh-tw": "最貼心的人之一他用他業餘時間嘗試安排相親而且我知道如果我有問題他會盡其所能幫助我現在，我認為Sean Hannity是百分之九十九政治錯誤的但是他的感情正確，讓人印象深刻", "en": "He spends his free timetrying to fix up his staff on blind dates, and I know that if I ever had a problem, he would do anything he could to help. Now, I think Sean Hannityis 99 percent politically wrong, but his emotional correctnessis strikingly impressive."}, {"zh-tw": "這就是為甚麼人民聽從他因為你不會讓任何人認可你如果他們事先沒有傾聽你的想法", "en": "And that's why people listen to him. Because you can't getanyone to agree with you if they don't even listen to you first."}, {"zh-tw": "我們花費了如此多的時間談論過去不足的時間談論我們的分歧如果我們開始尋找相互憐憫我們就能成功建立共識", "en": "We spend so much timetalking past each other and not enough time talkingthrough our disagreements. And if we can start to findcompassion for one another, then we have a shotat building common ground."}, {"zh-tw": "雖然聽起來很做作我只是站在這裡布教但是當你嘗試將它實踐它充滿了力量所以有人說他憎恨移民們我嘗試想像他們一定有多麼恐懼他們的社區正在改變，早已不是曾經相識的樣子", "en": "It actually sounds really hokeyto say it standing up here, but when you try to put it in practice, it's really powerful. So someone who says they hate immigrants, I try to imagine how scared they must be that their community is changingfrom what they've always known."}, {"zh-tw": "或者，有人說他們不喜歡教師工會我敢說，他們絕對會絕望的看到他們孩子的學校逐漸變成貧民窟他們只是尋找一個可以責怪的人我們的挑戰在於找到對他人的同情心我們同樣渴望從別人得到", "en": "Or someone who says theydon't like teachers' unions, I bet they're really devastated to seetheir kid's school going into the gutter, and they're just lookingfor someone to blame. Our challenge is to findthe compassion for others that we want them to have for us."}, {"zh-tw": "那就是感情正確我不是說那很簡單", "en": "That is emotional correctness. I'm not saying it's easy."}, {"zh-tw": "平均大概每天5.6次我不得不停下來回復所有收到的充滿低劣語言的憎惡郵件。所有這些尋找同情與敵人的共識的事情對我像是一種政治精神練習而且我不是Dalai Lama", "en": "An average of, like, 5.6 times per day I have to stop myself from respondingto all of my hate mail with a flurry of vile profanities. This whole finding compassionand common ground with your enemies thing is kind of like a political-spiritualpractice for me, and I ain't the Dalai Lama."}, {"zh-tw": "我並不完美，但是我是樂觀的因為我不只收到憎惡郵件", "en": "I'm not perfect,but what I am is optimistic. Because I don't just get hate mail."}, {"zh-tw": "我收到了很多極其美好的信，真的很多我一直以來最愛的一封信，這樣說道“我不是你政治學的超級粉絲或者有時你的歪曲邏輯，但是我是你個人的超級粉絲。“雖然這個人現在不贊成我（笑）", "en": "I get a lot of really niceletters, lots of them. And one of my all-time favorites begins: \"I am not a big fanof your political leanings or your sometimes tortured logic, but I'm a big fan of you as a person.\" Now this guy doesn'tagree with me -- yet."}, {"zh-tw": "但是他在傾聽，不是因為我說了什麼而是因為我是如何表達的而且，無論如何，儘管我們從沒相見我們成功的建立了一種聯繫", "en": "But he's listening -- not because of what I said,but because of how I said it. And somehow, even though we've never met,we've managed to form a connection."}, {"zh-tw": "那就是感情正確那就是我們如何開始一種交流引領著變革謝謝（鼓掌）", "en": "That's emotional correctness, and that's how we start the conversations that really lead to change.
