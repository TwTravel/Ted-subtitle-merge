In this video clip, that was shot half a kilometer,or about a third of a mile, underground, in the cave of Cudon in Spain, we found a seriesof red paintings on a ceiling in a previously unexploredsection of the cave.

And while certain signsspan thousands of kilometers, other signs had much morerestricted distribution patterns, with some being limitedto a single territory, like we see herewith these divided rectangles that are only found in northern Spain, and which some researchers have speculated could be some sortof family or clan signs.", "en": " 但65%的符號在那段時間內不斷的出現-- 比如線條、四方形三角形、橢圓形和圓形 接近冰河時期末開始 出現在庇里牛斯山上的萬年山洞 有些符號的分佈範圍長達幾千公里 有些的分佈則比較受限 甚至當中只分佈在單一區域 像這些被劃分的四方形 只出現在北西班牙 而有些學者認為 這些可能是家族或氏族的象徵符號"}, {"zh-tw": " On a side note, there is surprising degreeof similarity in the earliest rock art found all the way from France and Spainto Indonesia and Australia. With many of the same signsappearing in such far-flung places, especially in that 30,000to 40,000-year range, it's starting to seem increasingly likely that this invention actually traces backto a common point of origin in Africa.", "en": " 順帶一提 從法國到西班牙以及自印尼到澳洲 出現的早期石畫的相似度驚人地高 當中相同的符號在相隔很遠的地方同時出現 尤其在三萬到四萬年前這段時間內 我越來越認為 這些創作的共同發源地能夠追朔到非洲"}, {"zh-tw": " But that I'm afraid,is a subject for a future talk. So back to the matter at hand.", "en": " 但恐怕那又會是下次演講的主題 那我們回過頭來看看"}, {"zh-tw": " There could be no doubt that these signswere meaningful to their creators, like these 25,000-year-oldbas-relief sculptures from La Roque de Venasque in France.

There's just not enoughcharacters at this point to have represented all of the wordsin the spoken language, something which is a requirementfor a full writing system.", "en": " 當然這還稱不上的文字 這裡的符號數量沒有多到 可以代表所有口述的詞彙 要知道這是完整書寫系統的必要因素"}, {"zh-tw": " Nor do we see the signsrepeating regularly enough to suggest that they weresome sort of alphabet.

So a picture of a bird would reallyhave represented that animal.", "en": " 世上最古老的圖案溝通-- 蘇美的楔形文字、埃及的象形文字以及中國的漢字 皆在四五千年前出現 每一個都萌芽於更早期的原型 由數字記號和象形符號組成 當中的意義和圖形是相符的 鳥的圖形顧名思義就是鳥的意思"}, {"zh-tw": " It's only later that we start to seethese pictographs become more stylized, until they almost become unrecognizable and that we also start to seemore symbols being invented to represent all those othermissing words in language -- things like pronouns, adverbs, adjectives.

Or maybe even rivers, mountains,trees -- landscape features, possibly like this black penniformsurrounded by strange bell-shaped signs from the site of El Castillo in Spain.", "en": " 相反，有很高的可能性 這些早期的畫家其實是在書寫數字記號 像這些在西西里Riparo di Za Minic的線條 又或者是在創造或風格化 他們周遭的事物 是否有些代表著武器或建築？ 或是天體，如星座之類的？ 甚至是河流、山川、樹木--自然景觀 像是這些被奇怪的鐘狀符號圍繞著的黑色羽狀符號 出現於西班牙的卡斯蒂略金字塔（El Castillo)"}, {"zh-tw": " The term penniformmeans \"feather-shaped\" in Latin, but could this actually bea depiction of a plant or a tree? Some researchers have begunto ask these questions about certain signs at specific sites, but I believe the time has cometo revisit this category as a whole. The irony in all of this, of course, is that having just carefully classifiedall of the signs into a single category, I have a feeling that my next stepwill involve breaking it back apart as different types of imageryare identified and separated off.", "en": " Penniform 在拉丁文裡是『羽狀』的意思 但有沒有可能這其實是一種植物或樹木的示意圖？ 有些學者已經開始 針對這些特定地點找到的符號提出疑問了 但我相信是時候讓我們整體性的重溫這主題了 諷刺的是 當我精心的把這些符號歸納成一個類別 我有預感下一步就是拆散它們 來應付不同的符號的辨識和區分"}, {"zh-tw": " Now don't get me wrong, the later creationof fully developed writing was an impressive feat in its own right. But it's important to remember that those early writing systemsdidn't come out of a vacuum.", "en": " 請不要誤會 一個完整的書寫系統在後期所發明的文字 本身確實是個令人敬佩的貢獻。 但切記 早期的書寫系統並不是無中生有的"}, {"zh-tw": " And that even 5,000 years ago, people were already buildingon something much older, with its origins stretching backtens of thousands of years -- to the geometric signsof Ice Age Europe and far beyond, to that point, deepin our collective history, when someone first came up with the ideaof making a graphic mark, and forever changed the natureof how we communicate. Thank you.", "en": " 即便是五千年前 人們已經在更古老的東西上創造新的事物 其根源可以追朔到千萬年前-- 到冰河時期歐洲的幾何圖形甚至更久遠以前 直到最初始的那個當下 有個人心血來潮畫出一個圖形符號 而永遠改變了我們溝通的性質 謝謝"}], "title": "Genevieve Von Petzinger Why Are These 32 Symbols Found In Ancient Caves All Over Europe"}
