That whole range of issues that I'll refer to in shorthandas \"gender violence issues,\" they've been seen as women's issuesthat some good men help out with, but I have a problem with that frameand I don't accept it.", "en": " 我要與大家分享 從典範轉移觀點 看性別暴力問題—— 性侵犯、家暴、配偶或同居人虐待 性騷擾、兒童性虐待 這一系列的問題我簡稱為 性別暴力議題 這些被視為「好男人會出手幫助」的婦女問題 但我不懂這樣的思考框架 也無法接受"}, {"zh-tw": " I don't see these as women's issuesthat some good men help out with. In fact, I'm going to arguethat these are men's issues, first and foremost.", "en": " 我不認為這些是婦女問題而好男人願意幫助的 事實上我要說服大家這件事從一開始"}, {"zh-tw": " Now obviously -- Obviously, they're also women's issues,so I appreciate that, but calling gender violencea women's issue is part of the problem, for a number of reasons. The first is that it gives menan excuse not to pay attention, right? A lot of men hearthe term \"women's issues\" and we tend to tune it out, and we think, \"I'm a guy; that's for the girls,\"or \"that's for the women.\" And a lot of men literally don't getbeyond the first sentence as a result.", "en": " 就是男人的問題 當然，這也是女人的議題 我瞭解這狀況，但稱 性別暴力為婦女問題本身就是問題的一部分 有幾點原因 第一，這給男人不理會的藉口 是吧？很多男人一聽到「婦女問題」這個名詞 就把耳朵關上了，我們會想 「嘿，我是男的，那是女孩子的問題。」或「那是女人的問題。」 結果是很多男人聽完第一句話後 就不再聽下去了"}, {"zh-tw": " It's almost like a chipin our brain is activated, and the neural pathways takeour attention in a different direction when we hear the term \"women's issues.\" This is also true, by the way,of the word \"gender,\" because a lot of peoplehear the word \"gender\" and they think it means \"women.\" So they think that gender issuesis synonymous with women's issues. There's some confusionabout the term gender.", "en": " 幾乎就像當我們聽到「婦女問題」這名詞的時候 腦子裡的晶片就被啟動神經通路把我們的注意力 帶往不同的方向 順帶一提，這同時也應用在「性別」這個單詞 因為很多人一聽到「性別」這詞 就認為這是指「女人」 所以他們認為性別問題是「婦女問題」的同義詞 大家對性別這個名詞有點混淆"}, {"zh-tw": " And let me illustratethat confusion by way of analogy. So let's talk for a moment about race.", "en": " 讓我以類比法實際地描繪一下這種混淆 我們來談一下種族"}, {"zh-tw": " In the US, when we hear the word \"race,\" a lot of people thinkthat means African-American, Latino, Asian-American, Native American, South Asian, Pacific Islander, on and on.

This is one of the ways that dominantsystems maintain and reproduce themselves, which is to say the dominant groupis rarely challenged to even think about its dominance, because that's one of the keycharacteristics of power and privilege, the ability to go unexamined, lacking introspection, in fact beingrendered invisible, in large measure, in the discourse about issuesthat are primarily about us.", "en": " 對吧？就像白人沒有什麼種族認同的問題 也不會被歸類到一些種族或社會結構 就像異性戀者沒有性取向 男人沒有性別一樣 這是優勢群體維持 及複製優勢的方法之一，就是說 優勢群體極少受到質疑進而思考自己的優勢地位 因為這是有權有勢的 關鍵特徵之一，就這些主要和我們有關的問題 能夠未經思索，不需內省反思 事實上還大幅呈現出 視而不見的狀況"}, {"zh-tw": " And this is amazing how this worksin domestic and sexual violence, how men have been largely erasedfrom so much of the conversation about a subjectthat is centrally about men.

I make films and I work with high tech, but I'm still old school as an educator, and I want to share with you this exercise that illustrateson the sentence-structure level how the way that we think,literally the way that we use language, conspires to keepour attention off of men.", "en": " 我對於某些基本事項的想法很老式 我工作時──我是拍電影的──運用很多高科技 但作為教育家，我還是很老派 而我想跟大家分享這段練習 就是以句子結構層級來解釋 我們是如何思考 我們正確地使用語言的方法 圖謀把注意力從男人轉移到別處"}, {"zh-tw": " This is about domesticviolence in particular, but you can plug in other analogues. This comes from the workof the feminist linguist Julia Penelope.", "en": " 這裡特別以家暴來舉例 但你也可以套用在其他相似情況上 這節自女性主義語言學家朱莉亞‧賓娜羅普 (Julia Penelope) 的研究"}, {"zh-tw": " It starts with a very basicEnglish sentence: \"John beat Mary.\" That's a good English sentence. John is the subject, beat is the verb,Mary is the object, good sentence.", "en": " 從非常基本的英語句子開始： 「約翰打瑪麗。」 這是很好的英語句子 約翰是主詞，打是動詞 瑪麗是受詞。好句子"}, {"zh-tw": " Now we're going to moveto the second sentence, which says the same thingin the passive voice. \"Mary was beaten by John.\" And now a whole lothas happened in one sentence.", "en": " 現在我們來看第二句 說的是同一件事，但以被動態說 「瑪麗被約翰打。」 現在這句裡隱藏了很多東西"}, {"zh-tw": " We've gone from \"John beat Mary\" to \"Mary was beaten by John.\" We've shifted our focusin one sentence from John to Mary, and you can see John is very closeto the end of the sentence, well, close to droppingoff the map of our psychic plain. The third sentence, John is dropped, and we have, \"Mary was beaten,\" and now it's all about Mary.", "en": " 我們從「約翰打瑪麗。」 到「瑪麗被約翰打。」 我們已經把這個句子的焦點從約翰轉成瑪麗 你可以看到約翰被放在句子最末 可以說幾乎要從我們的意識裡跑出去了 第三句話，約翰真的不見了 而我們得到「瑪麗被打了。」這句話 所以現在變成只跟瑪麗有關"}, {"zh-tw": " We're not even thinking about John,it's totally focused on Mary. Over the past generation, the term we've usedsynonymous with \"beaten\" is \"battered,\" so we have \"Mary was battered.\" And the final sentence in this sequence,flowing from the others, is, \"Mary is a battered woman.\" So now Mary's very identity --Mary is a battered woman -- is what was done to her by Johnin the first instance.", "en": " 我們甚至不再想到約翰所有的焦點都在瑪麗身上 過去這一代，我們用的名詞中 「被打」與「被扁」為同義字 所以我們說瑪麗「被扁了」 而這系列的最後一句話 已經與其它句無關聯了，就是 「瑪麗是個被扁的女人。」 所以雖然瑪麗的真正身份──瑪麗是個被扁的女人 已在第一句話裡交代即是「被約翰打了的人」"}, {"zh-tw": " But we've demonstrated that Johnhas long ago left the conversation. Those of us who workin the domestic and sexual violence field know that victim-blamingis pervasive in this realm, which is to say, blaming the personto whom something was done rather than the person who did it.", "en": " 但我們已經示範了約翰早就從句子裡拿掉了 那麼，我們這些處理家暴及性暴力的人 都知道責備受害者是這領域裡普遍存在的現象 也就是說，大家都責備受害者 而不是施暴者"}, {"zh-tw": " And we say: why do theygo out with these men? Why are they attracted to them?Why do they keep going back? What was she wearing at that party?What a stupid thing to do. Why was she drinkingwith those guys in that hotel room? This is victim blaming,and there are many reasons for it, but one is that our cognitive structureis set up to blame victims.", "en": " 我們會說這樣的話為什麼這些女人要跟這種男人出去？ 為什麼她們會受這種男人吸引？ 為什麼她們還要回去？她在派對上穿什麼？ 做這個多蠢啊！為什麼她要跟 那群男人在那個旅館房間裡喝酒？ 這就是責備受害者，而這麼做的理由很多 但其中一個理由是我們建立了整個認知結構 去責備受害者，而這是完全不自覺的"}, {"zh-tw": " This is all unconscious. Our whole cognitive structureis set up to ask questions about women and women's choicesand what they're doing, thinking, wearing.", "en": " 我們建立了整個認知結構，去問一些關於 女人本身、女人的選擇及她們正在做的事情 想什麼、穿什麼"}, {"zh-tw": " And I'm not going to shout downpeople who ask questions about women. It's a legitimate thing to ask.", "en": " 我不是要用口水把那些問女人問題的人淹死 好嗎？這些問題很合理"}, {"zh-tw": " But's let's be clear:Asking questions about Mary is not going to get us anywherein terms of preventing violence. We have to ask a differentset of questions.", "en": " 但讓我們澄清一點： 從預防暴力的角度看，發問一些關於瑪麗的問題根本起不了作用 我們必須問不一樣的問題 你瞭解我接下來想說什麼，對吧？"}, {"zh-tw": " The questions are not about Mary,they're about John. They include things like,why does John beat Mary? Why is domestic violence still a bigproblem in the US and all over the world? What's going on?Why do so many men abuse physically, emotionally, verbally, and other ways, the women and girls, and the men and boys,that they claim to love? What's going on with men? Why do so many adult mensexually abuse little girls and boys? Why is that a common problemin our society and all over the world today? Why do we hear over and over again about new scandals eruptingin major institutions like the Catholic Churchor the Penn State football program or the Boy Scouts of America,on and on and on? And then local communitiesall over the country and all over the world.", "en": " 這些並不是瑪麗的問題這些問題是關於約翰的 這些問題包括了許多事情例如為什麼約翰要打瑪麗？ 為什麼家暴在美國以致全世界 仍然是個大問題？ 這是怎麼回事？為什麼這麼多男人要在 心理上、情緒上、話語上或以其他方法虐待 女人及女孩，男人及男孩 他們宣稱那些仍愛的人？男人是怎麼了？ 為什麼這麼多男人要性虐待小女孩及小男孩？ 為什麼這個問題今天普遍 存在我們的社會及全世界？ 為什麼我們一再聽到 有名的大機構爆發新醜聞 如天主教會或賓州州大美式足球隊 或美國童子軍等等？ 還有在全國各地及全世界的 地方社區組織，對吧？我們一直聽見"}, {"zh-tw": " We hear about it all the time. The sexual abuse of children.", "en": " 「兒童性虐待」這種事"}, {"zh-tw": " What's going on with men?Why do so many men rape women in our society and around the world? Why do so many men rape other men? What is going on with men? And then what is the roleof the various institutions in our society that are helping to produceabusive men at pandemic rates? Because this isn'tabout individual perpetrators. That's a naive way to understandingwhat is a much deeper and more systematic social problem.", "en": " 男人是怎麼了？在我們的社會及全世界 為什麼這麼多男人要強暴女人？ 為什麼有這麼多男人要強暴其他男人？ 男人到底怎麼了？ 還有我們社會裡的各種機構 正在以流感傳播的速度一樣幫助產生虐待傾向的男人 究竟這些機構扮演著什麼角色？ 因為這與個別施暴者無關 就這麼樣去理解更深層更系統化 的社會問題，真的很天真"}, {"zh-tw": " The perpetrators aren't these monsterswho crawl out of the swamp and come into townand do their nasty business and then retreat into the darkness. That's a very naive notion, right? Perpetrators are much more normalthan that, and everyday than that.", "en": " 你知道，施暴者並不是那些 沼澤裡爬行的怪物 跑到鎮上來，幹幾件壞事 然後又躲回黑暗處 這種想法非常天真，好嗎？ 施暴者比那些怪物較為正常 也較日常了"}, {"zh-tw": " So the question is, what are we doing herein our society and in the world? What are the roles of various institutions in helping to produce abusive men? What's the role of religiousbelief systems, the sports culture,the pornography culture, the family structure, economics,and how that intersects, and race and ethnicityand how that intersects? How does all this work? And then, once we start makingthose kinds of connections and asking those importantand big questions, then we can talk abouthow we can be transformative, in other words, how can we dosomething differently? How can we change the practices? How can we changethe socialization of boys and the definitions of manhoodthat lead to these current outcomes? These are the kind of questionsthat we need to be asking and the kind of workthat we need to be doing, but if we're endlessly focusedon what women are doing and thinking in relationships or elsewhere, we're not going to get to that piece. I understand that a lot of women who have been trying to speak outabout these issues, today and yesterdayand for years and years, often get shouted down for their efforts.", "en": " 所以我提出的問題是，在社會及世界裡 我們正在做什麼？ 各種機構在助長產生 暴力傾向的男人上扮演什麼角色？ 宗教信仰體系 體育文化、色情文化 家庭結構、經濟，又扮演著什麼角色？這些又如何與之交錯？ 還有種族和族裔，這些又如何與之交錯？ 這些問題怎麼串起來的？ 然後，一旦我們開始把這些關聯串起來 並發問一些大哉問 然後我們才能談及應該如何變革 換句話說，我們如何才能夠以不同的方式做些事情？ 我們如何能夠改變習性？ 我們如何能夠改變男孩的社會化過程 及男子氣概的定義而這過程和定義導致現在結果的？ 這些是我們需要問的問題 我們需要做的工作 但如果我們只是永無止盡地聚焦在女人在男女關係 或其他關係裡做了什麼或想了什麼 我們絕對無法成功 那麼，我知道有很多女人 試著在現在及過去提出這些議題 但過去這麼多年 她們的努力往往被喝止"}, {"zh-tw": " They get called nasty nameslike \"male-basher\" and \"man-hater,\" and the disgustingand offensive \"feminazi\", right? And you know what all this is about? It's called kill the messenger. It's because the women who are standing up and speaking out for themselvesand for other women as well as for men and boys, it's a statement to themto sit down and shut up, keep the current system in place, because we don't like itwhen people rock the boat.", "en": " 她們被冠上汙名像「強腳」 「恐男」 以及既噁心又無禮的「女權納粹」。對吧？ 而你知道這一切代表什麼嗎？ 這叫殺了來使 這是因為這些挺身而出的女人 這些為了自己或別的女人或為了男人或男孩 而大聲疾呼的女人這是給她們的下馬威 要她們坐下閉嘴，保持現有的狀態 因為我們不喜歡人家惹事生非 我們不喜歡別人挑戰我們的權力"}, {"zh-tw": " We don't like it when peoplechallenge our power.

We live in the world together.", "en": " 說的事情之一，我總是這麼說 就是我們需要更多有勇氣及能力的男人 開始挺身而出為這件事發聲 與婦女持相同立場而不是反對她們 並假裝在某種程度上這只是 兩性之間的戰爭和另一種無聊事罷了 我們在這世界共生共存 順帶一提有一件真的很困擾我的事"}, {"zh-tw": " And by the way, one of the thingsthat really bothers me about some of the rhetoricagainst feminists and others who have built the battered women'sand rape crisis movements around the world is that somehow, like I said,that they're anti-male. What about all the boys who are profoundlyaffected in a negative way by what some adult man is doing againsttheir mother, themselves, their sisters? What about all those boys? What about all the young men and boys who have been traumatizedby adult men's violence? You know what? The same system that producesmen who abuse women, produces men who abuse other men.", "en": " 就是有些言論，是反女性主義 反重建受虐婦女 及反對世界各地強暴危機意識運動的 就是像我之前說的說他們有點反男性 那麼那些因他們的母親、他們本身 他們的姐妹被成年男子蹂躪 而深受負面影響的男孩要怎麼辦？ 那些男孩子怎麼辦？ 那些因成年男子施暴 而精神受創的年輕男子及男孩又怎麼辦？ 你知道嗎？會產生對婦女施虐的男人的系統 同樣也會產生對其他男人施虐的男人 如果我們想談男性受害者"}, {"zh-tw": " And if we want to talk about male victims,let's talk about male victims. Most male victims of violenceare the victims of other men's violence.", "en": " 我們就來談談男性受害者 大多數男性暴力受害者都是其他男人暴力行為的受害者 所以這是女性男性的共同點"}, {"zh-tw": " So that's something that both womenand men have in common. We are both victims of men's violence.", "en": " 我們兩性都是男性暴力的受害者 所以這與我們有直接利害關係"}, {"zh-tw": " So we have it in our direct self-interest, not to mention the factthat most men that I know have women and girlsthat we care deeply about, in our families and our friendshipcircles and every other way.

Now, the nature of the workthat I do and my colleagues do in the sports cultureand the US military, in schools, we pioneered this approachcalled the bystander approach to gender-violence prevention. And I just want to give youthe highlights of the bystander approach, because it's a big thematic shift, although there's lots of particulars, but the heart of it is,instead of seeing men as perpetrators and women as victims, or women as perpetrators, men as victims, or any combination in there.", "en": " 很明顯我們應該大聲疾呼，不是嗎？ 那麼，我與我同事在體育圈 及美國軍隊、學校裡的工作性質 我們是首先使用旁觀者處遇模式 來防止性別暴力的人 在此我只提旁觀者模式的幾項重點 因為這是很大的主題轉移 雖然有很多詳情 但中心思想是不要只把男人看作加害者 女人看作受害者 或女人是加害者，男人是受害者 或以上任何排列組合"}, {"zh-tw": " I'm using the gender binary. I know there's more than men and women,there's more than male and female.", "en": " 我現在使用兩性二元法我知道不應 只是男人女人男性女性這樣的二分法 而且的確有女人是加害者"}, {"zh-tw": " And there are women who are perpetrators, and of course there aremen who are victims. There's a whole spectrum.", "en": " 當然也有男人是受害者 要全方位看"}, {"zh-tw": " But instead of seeing itin the binary fashion, we focus on all of usas what we call bystanders, and a bystander is defined as anybodywho is not a perpetrator or a victim in a given situation, so in other words friends, teammates,colleagues, coworkers, family members, those of us who are not directlyinvolved in a dyad of abuse, but we are embedded in social,family, work, school, and other peer culture relationships with people who might bein that situation. What do we do? How do we speak up?How do we challenge our friends? How do we support our friends? But how do we not remain silentin the face of abuse? Now, when it comesto men and male culture, the goal is to get men who are not abusiveto challenge men who are.", "en": " 但與其用二元法來看待兩性問題 我們該把焦點放在我們整體這些所謂旁觀者上 旁觀者的定義是在特定情況下 既非加害者亦非受害者的人 也就是說像朋友、隊友、同事 同工、家人這些 與虐待二元體沒有直接關聯的人 但我們都在社會家庭工作學校 及其他同儕文化關係上 與虐待有關的人緊密相連那我們該怎麼做？ 要怎麼挺身而出？要如何質問朋友？ 要怎麼給予朋友支持？尤其是在面對虐待時 要如何不保持沈默？ 現在，在說到男人及男性文化時 目標是讓不施暴的男人 挑戰質問施暴的男人"}, {"zh-tw": " And when I say abusive, I don't mean justmen who are beating women. We're not just saying a man whose friendis abusing his girlfriend needs to stop the guyat the moment of attack.", "en": " 這裡說的施暴，不單是指 打女人的男人 我們不單是指一個男人看到朋友 正在打他的女友，所以需要 立刻停止這傢伙施暴"}, {"zh-tw": " That's a naive wayof creating a social change. It's along a continuum, we're tryingto get men to interrupt each other.", "en": " 想以這種方式造成社會變遷很幼稚 這需要長期經營如果我們試著要讓男人 互相干預彼此"}, {"zh-tw": " So, for example, if you're a guyand you're in a group of guys playing poker, talking, hanging out,no women present, and another guy says something sexistor degrading or harassing about women, instead of laughing alongor pretending you didn't hear it, we need men to say,\"Hey, that's not funny. that could be my sisteryou're talking about, and could you joke about something else? Or could you talk about something else? I don't appreciate that kind of talk.\" Just like if you're a white person and another white person makesa racist comment, you'd hope, I hope, that white people would interruptthat racist enactment by a fellow white person.", "en": " 所以，舉個例如果你是個男的而且你與一群男人 玩撲克聊天一起混，沒有女人在場 有個男的說了一些歧視或貶低 或騷擾女人的話 除了隨之大笑或假裝沒聽到 我們需要男人能說：「嘿！這不好笑 你知道嗎，你說的可能是我的姊妹 你可不可以說些別的笑話？ 或者談點別的事？ 我不喜歡那種對話。」 就像如果你是白人聽到另外一個白人 發表種族歧視評論我希望能看到 你會期待有白人能打斷 另一個白人同胞所做的種族歧視"}, {"zh-tw": " Just like with heterosexism,if you're a heterosexual person and you yourself don't enactharassing or abusive behaviors towards people of varyingsexual orientations, if you don't say something in the faceof other heterosexual people doing that, then, in a sense, isn't your silencea form of consent and complicity? Well, the bystander approachis trying to give people tools to interrupt that process and to speak upand to create a peer culture climate where the abusive behaviorwill be seen as unacceptable, not just because it's illegal,but because it's wrong and unacceptable in the peer culture. And if we can get to the place where men who act out in sexist wayswill lose status, young men and boys who act out in sexist and harassing waystowards girls and women, as well as towards other boys and men, will lose statusas a result of it, guess what? We'll see a radicaldiminution of the abuse.", "en": " 就像在談異性戀時如果你是異性戀 雖然你本身不會去騷擾或虐待 跟你不同性取向的的人 但如果你不在別的異性戀騷擾別人時挺身而出 那麼在某種意義上來說難道你的沉默 不也是一種形式的同意及共謀嗎？ 是的，旁觀者模式的確試著給人們方法 來干預虐待過程及挺身而出 以創造同儕文化的氣氛 讓虐待行為被視為不可接受 不僅是因為這違法，更因為這是錯的 在同儕文化中不能被接受 如果我們能做到當男人 表現出性別歧視時會失去社會地位 年輕男人及男孩表現出性別歧視 並騷擾女孩及女人時 或是騷擾其他男孩及男人時 會因此失去社會地位猜猜看會怎樣？ 我們會看到虐待現象急遽減少"}, {"zh-tw": " Because the typical perpetratoris not sick and twisted.
