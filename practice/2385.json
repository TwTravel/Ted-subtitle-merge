What is a coraland where does it come from?

So in the research I dowith my colleagues in Curaçao, we try to figure outwhat a baby coral needs in that critical early stage, what it's looking for and how we can try to help itthrough that process.", "en": " 它們也許可以快速調整 來適應人類這個星球。 所以我和同事在古拉索的研究中， 我們嘗試尋找小珊瑚蟲 在初期階段生長的需求， 這些小珊瑚蟲到底在找些什麼， 以及我們怎麼才能幫助它們渡過這些難關。"}, {"zh-tw": " I'm going to show you three examplesof the work we've done to try to answer those questions. A few years ago we took a 3D printerand we made coral choice surveys -- different colors and different textures, and we simply asked the coralwhere they preferred to settle.", "en": " 我將向你們展示我們工作中的三個例子， 並以此來解答我剛提出的那些困惑。 在幾年以前，我們用3D打印設備，進行了「珊瑚選擇調查研究」， 給出不同顏色和材質的環境， 我們只是簡單地詢問珊瑚蟲，它們喜歡住在哪裡。"}, {"zh-tw": " And we found that corals,even without the biology involved, still prefer white and pink,the colors of a healthy reef. And they prefer crevicesand grooves and holes, where they will be safefrom being trampled or eaten by a predator.", "en": " 然後我們發現，珊瑚蟲即使在沒有任何生物介入的情況下， 仍然較喜歡白色和粉紅色的健康礁石。 它們喜歡裂縫，凹槽，還有洞， 在那些地方它們可以安全地不受外界踐踏， 也不會被捕食者吃掉。"}, {"zh-tw": " So we can use this knowledge, we can go back and saywe need to restore those factors -- that pink, that white, those crevices,those hard surfaces -- in our conservation projects.

Now in addition to the surfaces, we also study the chemicaland microbial signals that attract corals to reefs.", "en": " 我們可以選擇用這些材料、顏色、紋路， 讓整個生態系統有利於珊瑚蟲的生存。 除了研究合適的表面， 我們也研究了可以吸引珊瑚蟲 附著在礁石上的化學和微生物訊號。"}, {"zh-tw": " Starting about six years ago,I began culturing bacteria from surfaces where corals had settled. And I tried those one by one by one, looking for the bacteria that wouldconvince corals to settle and attach.", "en": " 大約六年前，我就開始培養棲息在珊瑚礁表面的細菌。 我一個一個試， 尋找那些能誘導珊瑚蟲定居和吸附的細菌種類。"}, {"zh-tw": " And we now have manybacterial strains in our freezer that will reliably cause corals to go through that settlementand attachment process.

And this was in part becausein over 30 years of research surveys, scientists had never founda baby pillar coral.", "en": " 實際上，它是真的太稀有了， 以至於它去年在瀕危物種列表上 被認定是瀕危物種， 這不難理解，因為在過去30年的研究中， 科學家從未發現過一隻幼年柱形珊瑚蟲。"}, {"zh-tw": " We weren't even sureif they could still reproduce, or if they were still reproducing. So four years ago, we startedfollowing these at night and watching to see if we couldfigure out when they spawn in Curaçao.", "en": " 我們之前都無法確信它是否還可以繼續繁衍， 或者當時是否還在繁殖。 所以四年前，我們開始在夜間跟蹤它們， 並觀察它們什麼時候會在古拉索產卵。"}, {"zh-tw": " We got some good tipsfrom our colleagues in Florida, who had seen one in 2007, one in 2008, and eventually we figured outwhen they spawn in Curaçao and we caught it.

We collected this, we got itback to the lab, we got it to fertilize and we got baby pillar coralsswimming in our lab.", "en": " 而右邊是一隻公的珊瑚蟲在釋放精子。 我們收集了這些卵子和精子，帶回實驗室進行培育， 於是就有了柱狀珊瑚蟲在我們實驗室里里游來游去。"}, {"zh-tw": " Thanks to the workof our scientific aunts and uncles, and thanks to the 10 years of practicewe've had in Curaçao at raising other coral species, we got some of those larvaeto go through the rest of the process and settle and attach, and turn into metamorphosed corals. So this is the first pillar coral babythat anyone ever saw.", "en": " 感謝我們科學界的叔叔阿姨們， 也要感謝我們在古拉索島上 十年培育其他珊瑚蟲種類的經驗， 我們有了這些珊瑚幼蟲，就可以完成剰下的步驟， 讓它們在礁石上附著和生存下來， 並成為變質珊瑚礁。 這是任何人都未曾見過的第一隻年幼柱狀珊瑚蟲。"}, {"zh-tw": " And I have to say --if you think baby pandas are cute, this is cuter. So we're starting to figure outthe secrets to this process, the secrets of coral reproductionand how we might help them.", "en": " 我不得不說——如果你們認為熊貓寶寶很可愛， 那這些小珊瑚蟲更可愛。 所以，我們開始研究珊瑚繁殖過程的秘密， 我們要找出如何幫助它們繁殖。"}, {"zh-tw": " And this is true all around the world; scientists are figuring out new waysto handle their embryos, to get them to settle, maybe even figuring out the methodsto preserve them at low temperatures, so that we can preservetheir genetic diversity and work with them more often. But this is still so low-tech.", "en": " 全世界都面臨著同樣的情況； 科學家們正在找出新的方法去處理珊瑚蟲的胚胎， 讓它們棲息生長， 甚至在想辦法把它們保存在低溫底下， 這樣我們就可以保存它們的基因多樣性， 並且有更多機會對它們進行研究。 但是這個過程的技術含量很低。"}, {"zh-tw": " We are limited by the space on our bench,the number of hands in the lab and the number of coffeeswe can drink in any given hour. Now, compare that to our other crises and our other areasof concern as a society.", "en": " 我們實驗室的空間有限，人手也不夠， 連喝個咖啡的時間都少的可憐。 現在，比對一下我們人類遇到的其它危機及社會問題。"}, {"zh-tw": " We have advanced medical technology,we have defense technology, we have scientific technology, we even have advanced technology for art. But our technologyfor conservation is behind.", "en": " 我們有先進的醫療技術，我們有先進的防禦技術， 我們也有科學手段， 甚至還有先進的藝術科技。 但是我們的保育技術卻遠遠落後。"}, {"zh-tw": " Think back to the mostdifficult job you ever did.
