And once our lives are touched by cancer, we quickly learn that there are basically three weapons, or three tools, that are available to fight the disease: surgery, radiation and chemotherapy.", "en": " 在我的生活圈子中,每個人都有與癌症交手的機會 如果不是個人親身經驗 也會因為或是至愛或家庭成員, 同事或朋友而與癌症交鋒 一旦我們的生活被癌症入侵後 我們會很快瞭解 目前基本上只有 三個武器, 或者說三個工具, 可以 用來對抗癌症: 手術, 放射療法及化療"}, {"zh-tw": " And once we get involved in the therapeutic decisions, again either personally or with our loved ones and family members, we also very quickly learn the benefits, the trade-offs and the limitations of these tools. I'm very thankful to Jay and to Mark and the TEDMED team for inviting me today to describe a fourth tool, a new tool, that we call Tumor Treating Fields.", "en": " 而且一旦我們捲入 治療的決策群時, 相同的, 不管是親身體驗 或因至愛或家庭成員 我們一樣會很快知道 選擇任何一種治療方法, 有何好處? 有何損失? 及其極限。. 我非常感謝杰和馬克 當然還有TEDMED團隊 能讓我今天在此 向大家介紹第四種治療癌症的工具--新工具 我們稱它為\"腫瘤治療電能場\"。"}, {"zh-tw": " Tumor Treating Fields were invented by Dr. Yoram Palti, professor emeritus at the Technion in Israel. And they use low-intensity electric fields to fight cancer.", "en": " \"腫瘤治療電能場\" 是尤昂 帕提 博士所發明的 他是以色列理工學院的榮譽教授。 是利用低強度 的電場 來對抗癌症。"}, {"zh-tw": " To understand how Tumor Treating Fields work, we first need to understand what are electric fields. Let me first address a few popular misconceptions.", "en": " 想要瞭解\"腫瘤治療電場\" 如何運作 我們必須要先瞭解 什麼是電場? 讓我在此先呈清 幾個大家普遍的誤解"}, {"zh-tw": " First of all, electric fields are not an electric current that is coursing through the tissue. Electric fields are not ionizing radiation, like X-rays or proton beams, that bombard tissue to disrupt DNA.", "en": " 首先,電場 不是電流 穿越病人組織。 電場 不是游離輻射 像X 光或質子光束 會摧毀轟炸病人的組織 來破壞其DNA。"}, {"zh-tw": " And electric fields are not magnetism. What electric fields are are a field of forces.", "en": " 電場 也非利用磁性來作用 什麼是電場呢?電場是 “帶電粒子”在空間中所建立的“場”。"}, {"zh-tw": " And these forces act on, attract, bodies that have an electrical charge. The best way to visualize an electric field is to think of gravity.", "en": " 是具有“作用力” 作用, 吸引, 使病人體內 產生電荷。 最好的例子去想像電場是 把它看成重力(地球萬有引力)"}, {"zh-tw": " Gravity is also a field of forces that act on masses. We can all picture astronauts in space.", "en": " 重力也是相互作用的物理場 只是重力是有關於質量 我們可以想像在外太空中的太空人。"}, {"zh-tw": " They float freely in three dimensions without any forces acting on them. But as that space shuttle returns to Earth, and as the astronauts enter the Earth's gravitational field, they begin to see the effects of gravity.", "en": " 在三度空間中, 他們自由浮動 不須任何力量去推動他們。 但是當太空船 回航地球時 像太空人進入地球的引力場， 他們開始感受到重力的影響。"}, {"zh-tw": " They begin to be attracted towards Earth. And as they land, they're fully aligned in the gravitational field.", "en": " 他們開始被吸引到地球。 當他們登陸地球, 他們就完全被地球引力場所控制。"}, {"zh-tw": " We're, of course, all stuck in the Earth's gravitational field right now. That's why you're all in your chairs.", "en": " 當然我們現在都被困在地球的引力場內。 這就是為什麼你們會全坐在椅子上。"}, {"zh-tw": " And that's why we have to use our muscle energy to stand up, to walk around and to lift things. In cancer, cells rapidly divide and lead to uncontrolled tumor growth.", "en": " 這就是為什麼我們必須使用肌肉的能量 才能站起來，走動 和舉起任何東西。 對癌症而言， 細胞迅速分裂 最後導致腫瘤生長快速失控。"}, {"zh-tw": " We can think of a cell from an electrical perspective as if it's a mini space station. And in that space station we have the genetic material, the chromosomes, within a nucleus.", "en": " 讓我們想像一個細胞 從電氣角度的眼光來看 彷彿是一個小型的太空站。 在那個太空站中 有我們的遺傳物質，染色體， 存在一個細胞核內"}, {"zh-tw": " And out in the cytoplasmic soup we have special proteins that are required for cell division that float freely in this soup in three dimensions. Importantly, those special proteins are among the most highly charged objects in our body.", "en": " 外層的細胞質湯包中 有些特殊的蛋白質 是細胞分裂時所需要的 這些蛋白質在此湯中 向四面八方自由浮動 重要的是，這些特殊的蛋白質 是極易帶電荷的物質之一 在我們體內"}, {"zh-tw": " As cell division begins the nucleus disintegrates, the chromosomes line up in the middle of the cell and those special proteins undergo a three-dimensional sequence whereby they attach and they literally click into place end-on-end to form chains. These chains then progress and attach to the genetic material and pull the genetic material from one cell into two cells.", "en": " 當細胞開始分裂 細胞核解體， 在這細胞的正中間 染色體排起隊 這些特殊的蛋白質 進行三度空間排列 在那兒它們附上 然後文字上來說終端與終端點擊連結 形成許多鍊條。 這些鍊條 然後進化並連接上 遺傳物質上 然後拉扯著遺傳物質 最後從一個細胞分裂成兩個細胞。"}, {"zh-tw": " And this is exactly how one cancer cell becomes two cancer cells, two cancer cells become four cancer cells, and we have ultimately uncontrolled tumor growth. Tumor Treating Fields use externally placed transducers attached to a field generator to create an artificial electric field on that space station.", "en": " 這正是為什麼 一個癌症細胞會變成兩個癌細胞， 兩個癌細胞,成為四個癌細胞， 然後最終 腫瘤生長失控。 \"腫瘤治療電場\" 使用體外傳感器 連接到電場發電機 創建一個人工電場 在那個\"太空站\"上。"}, {"zh-tw": " And when that cellular space station is within the electric field, it acts on those highly charged proteins and aligns them. And it prevents them from forming those chains, those mitotic spindles, that are necessary to pull the genetic material into the daughter cells.", "en": " 所以當細胞\"太空站\" 籠罩在電場中， 就會活化這些極易帶電荷的蛋白質 控制它們 並阻止他們形成鏈條， 所謂的\"有絲分裂紡錘體\" 這是把遺傳物質拉進 兩個子細胞所須要的蛋白質。"}, {"zh-tw": " What we see is that the cells will attempt to divide for several hours. And they will either enter into this so-called cellular suicide, programmed cell death, or they will form unhealthy daughter cells and enter into apoptosis once they have divided.", "en": " 這裡可看到的是，細胞會試圖分裂 歷經好幾個小時。 這些細胞不是將進入 所謂的細胞自殺狀態， 是細胞自殺的機制系統， 不然就形成不健康的子細胞 使細胞早衰進而死亡 這是如果他們有分裂成功的結果。"}, {"zh-tw": " And we can observe this. What I'm going to show you next are two in vitro experiments.", "en": " 我們可以觀察到這一點。 接下去我要告訴你們的是 我們的兩個體外實驗。"}, {"zh-tw": " This is cultures, identical cultures, of cervical cancer cells. And we've stained these cultures with a green florescent dye so that we can look at these proteins that form these chains.", "en": " 這是培養皿 ,在一模一樣條件下, 培養子宮頸癌細胞。 我們將 讓它們帶有綠色螢光染料 這樣我們就可以看見這些蛋白質 形成鏈條，"}, {"zh-tw": " The first clip shows a normal cell division without the Tumor Treating Fields. What we see are, first of all, a very active culture, a lot of divisions, and then very clear nuclei once the cells have separated.", "en": " 第一個剪輯顯示 一個正常的細胞分裂 未受\"腫瘤治療電場\"影響。 首先，我們可看到 這個培養皿裡的 細胞分裂非常活躍， 當細胞分裂完成後 可看到很清楚的細胞核。"}, {"zh-tw": " And we can see them dividing throughout. When we apply the fields -- again, in the identical time-scale to the identical culture -- you're going to see something different.", "en": " 我們可以看到他們分裂的整個過程。 當我們應用\"腫瘤治療電場\" - 在相同長度的記錄時間內 來觀察生長條件相同的對照組 你們就會看到不同的結果。"}, {"zh-tw": " The cells round up for division, but they're very static in that position. We'll see two cells in the upper part of the screen attempting to divide.", "en": " 這些細胞想要打起精神分裂成長, 但事實上他們卻在那裡沒有進展。 這是兩個細胞 在屏幕的上部 企圖分裂。"}, {"zh-tw": " The one within the circle manages. But see how much of the protein is still throughout the nucleus, even in the dividing cell.", "en": " 在圓圈內的那個。 但, 看!有多少的蛋白質 仍然貫穿圍繞細胞核， 甚至在細胞分裂時。"}, {"zh-tw": " The one up there can't divide at all. And then this bubbling, this membrane bubbling, is the hallmark of apoptosis in this cell.", "en": " 那個在上方位置的根本無法分裂 然後接著冒泡，細胞膜起泡， 就是一個標誌 是此細胞將凋亡的特徵。"}, {"zh-tw": " Formation of healthy mitotic spindles is necessary for division in all cell types. We've applied Tumor Treating Fields to over 20 different cancers in the lab, and we see this effect in all of them.", "en": " 健康的有絲分裂紡錘體的形成 是細胞分裂繁殖必要的 每一種細胞都是如此 我們已經應用\"腫瘤治療電場\" 在實驗室中, 應用於超過20種不同的癌症， 我們想確認它對各種不同癌症 的效果"}, {"zh-tw": " Now importantly, these Tumor Treating Fields have no effect on normal undividing cells. 10 years ago, Dr. Palti founded a company called Novocure to develop his discovery into a practical therapy for patients.", "en": " 重要的是，現在我們已確認 \"腫瘤治療電場\" 對正常未分裂的細胞 沒有干擾效果。 10年前， 帕提博士創辦Novocure公司 以推展他的發現 使其能應用到病人的實際治療。"}, {"zh-tw": " In that time, Novocure's developed two systems -- one system for cancers in the head and another system for cancers in the trunk of the body. The first cancer that we have focused on is the deadly brain cancer, GBM.", "en": " 在那個時候，Novocure 開發兩個系統 - 一個系統是針對於頭部癌症 另一個系統是對身體軀幹內的癌症。 我們首先把重點放在GBM(多發性多形性膠質母細胞瘤) ， 這是一種致命的腦癌。"}, {"zh-tw": " GBM affects about 10,000 people in the U.S. each year. It's a death sentence.", "en": " 在美國每年 約10,000人得到GBM。 對病人而言, 這是死亡宣判書。"}, {"zh-tw": " The expected five year survival is less than five percent. And the typical patient with optimal therapy survives just a little over a year, and only about seven months from the time that the cancer is first treated and then comes back and starts growing again.", "en": " 預期可以有5年存活率的病人 低於百分之五。 而對大多數的GBM病人而言 即使使用最佳的治療方法 存活的時間只是略超過一年， 通常在第一次療程完成後 大約7個月後， 癌症會復發, 並開始再次增長。"}, {"zh-tw": " Novocure conducted its first phase three randomized trial in patients with recurrent GBM. So these are patients who had received surgery, high dose radiation to the head and first-line chemotherapy, and that had failed and their tumors had grown back.", "en": " Novocure進行 其第一階段的三個隨機試驗 所有的病人全是GBM復發者。 這些患者 都曾接受手術治療， 接受頭部高劑量輻射的療程 和採取過第一線化療， 全失敗，他們的腫瘤全長回來。"}, {"zh-tw": " We divided the patients into two groups. The first group received second-line chemotherapy, which is expected to double the life expectancy, versus no treatment at all.", "en": " 我們把每次實驗的病人分兩組 第一組接受第二線化療， 估計可將比不給予治療時預期壽命 延長一倍的時間。"}, {"zh-tw": " And then the second group received only Tumor Treating Field therapy. What we saw in that trial is that that the life expectancies of both groups -- so the chemotherapy treated group and the Tumor Treating Field group -- was the same.", "en": " 然後第二組 不給第二線化療藥物,只接受\"腫瘤治療電場\" 我們看到該試驗的結果是 這兩組病患的預期存活壽命 - 接受第二線化療藥物的化療組 和只接受\"腫瘤治療電場\"的這組病患 存活時間一樣"}, {"zh-tw": " But importantly, the Tumor Treating Field group suffered none of the side effects typical of chemotherapy patients. They had no pain, suffered none of the infections.", "en": " 但重要的是， 只接受\"腫瘤治療電場\"的這組病患 無遭受任何 化療病人通常會有的副作用 他們沒有痛苦， 沒有遭受感染的高風險。"}, {"zh-tw": " They had no nausea, diarrhea, constipation, fatigue that would be expected. Based on this trial, in April of this year, the FDA approved Tumor Treating Fields for the treatment of patients with recurrent GBM.", "en": " 他們有沒有噁心，腹瀉， 便秘，疲勞 這些都是化療可能的副作用。 根據這項試驗， 在今年4月， 美國食品衛生局(FDA)批准\"腫瘤治療電場\" 可被使用在 再復發型的GBM病患"}, {"zh-tw": " Importantly, it was the first time ever that the FDA included in their approval of an oncology treatment a quality of life claim. So I'm going to show you now one of the patients from this trial.", "en": " 重要的是，這是有史以來第一次 FDA批准加註 這種的腫瘤治療方法 提升了病人的生活品質。 我現在要告訴你們 一個我們臨床試驗 病人的故事"}, {"zh-tw": " Robert Dill-Bundi is a famous Swiss cycling champion.
