Far more effective, I have to say, than anything I later learned in law school.", "en": " 而我們總能贏得這些案件 因為法官看了這些都覺得很噁心 這方法，我必須承認 比我日後在法學院所學的都還要有效"}, {"zh-tw": " But over the course of these nine months, I grew frustrated with feeling like we were intervening too far downstream in the lives of our clients -- that by the time they came to us, they were already in crisis. And at the end of my freshman year of college, I read an article about the work that Dr. Barry Zuckerman was doing as Chair of Pediatrics at Boston Medical Center.", "en": " 但是在這九個月中 我越來越感到挫敗 因為在客戶的生活中 我們出手相助的時機總是太晚 當他們來尋求幫助時 他們的生活早已陷入危機 當我大一那年即將結束時 我讀到一篇文章 是有關Barry Zuckerman博士的工作 他是小兒科主任 在波士頓醫療中心工作"}, {"zh-tw": " And his first hire was a legal services attorney to represent the patients.

So I have spent hours upon hours trying to make sense of this weird Groundhog Day.", "en": " 我們現在 離Geiger開食物給他的病人當藥方已經45年 卻仍有醫生告訴我 \"面對這些問題我們奉行「不問、不說」的原則\" 在Geiger開始這項行動的45年後 導向健康組織必須重新創造 給予病人基本生活資源的的藥方 我花了好多時間 試圖了解這個怪異的迴圈"}, {"zh-tw": " How is it that if for decades we had a pretty straightforward tool for keeping patients, and especially low-income patients, healthy, that we didn't use it? If we know what it takes to have a healthcare system rather than a sick-care system, why don't we just do it? These questions, in my mind, are not hard because the answers are complicated, they are hard because they require that we be honest with ourselves. My belief is that it's almost too painful to articulate our aspirations for our healthcare system, or even admit that we have any at all.", "en": " 為什麼這幾十年來 我們一直有非常直接的方法讓病患健康 特別是低收入戶的患者 我們卻從不使用？ 如果我們知道要如何成立「健保」系統 而不是「病保」系統 為什麼我們不做呢？ 在我心中，這些問題 並不因為答案很複雜而困難 它們是如此困難，是因為它需要我們誠實的面對自己 我認為這是一件極為痛苦的事 以致我們無法表達對健保制度的期望 或甚至承認有任何期待"}, {"zh-tw": " Because if we did, they would be so removed from our current reality. But that doesn't change my belief that all of us, deep inside, here in this room and across this country, share a similar set of desires.", "en": " 因為如果我們這麼做 它們將看似遙不可及 不可能存在現實生活中 但這並不能改變我的信念 我認為每個人在心深處 在這間大廳和整個國家 都有相同的渴望"}, {"zh-tw": " That if we are honest with ourselves and listen quietly, that we all harbor one fiercely held aspiration for our healthcare: that it keep us healthy. This aspiration that our healthcare keep us healthy is an enormously powerful one.", "en": " 如果我們能誠實的面對自己 並安靜的傾聽 我們便能懷抱 對健保制度的熱切期望： 它幫我們保持健康 認為健保制度能讓人們健康的期待 是非常強大有影響力的"}, {"zh-tw": " And the way I think about this is that healthcare is like any other system. It's just a set of choices that people make.", "en": " 我是這麼認為: 健保制度跟其它制度一樣 它只是一系列人們的選擇"}, {"zh-tw": " What if we decided to make a different set of choices? What if we decided to take all the parts of healthcare that have drifted away from us and stand firm and say, \"No. These things are ours.", "en": " 如果我們決定 做出不同的選擇，將會如何? 如果我們決定不讓健保制度 拿走對我們有助益的部分 並且堅決的說：\"不 這些都是屬於我們的"}, {"zh-tw": " They will be used for our purposes. They will be used to realize our aspiration\"? What if everything we needed to realize our aspiration for healthcare was right there in front of us just waiting to be claimed? So that's where Health Leads began.", "en": " 它們會幫助我們達成目標 它們會被使用並實現 我們的期望\" 所有能讓我們實現 對健保制度期望的要件 會不會就在我們面前 等待被使用？ 這就是導向健康組織的開端"}, {"zh-tw": " We started with the prescription pad -- a very ordinary piece of paper -- and we asked, not what do patients need to get healthy -- antibiotics, an inhaler, medication -- but what do patients need to be healthy, to not get sick in the first place? And we chose to use the prescription for that purpose. So just a few miles from here at Children's National Medical Center, when patients come into the doctor's office, they're asked a few questions.", "en": " 我們從處方籤著手 一張非常平凡的紙 我們不問病患要怎麼做才能健康 不是抗生素、吸入劑、藥物治療 而是問病患需要什麼才能保持健康 讓他們一開始就不會生病 而我們選擇使用的藥方 專為這個目的 離這裡幾哩遠的地方 在國家兒童醫療中心 當病人來到醫生辦公室 他們會被問幾個問題"}, {"zh-tw": " They're asked, \"Are you running out of food at the end of the month? Do you have safe housing?\" And when the doctor begins the visit, she knows height, weight, is there food at home, is the family living in a shelter. And that not only leads to a better set of clinical choices, but the doctor can also prescribe those resources for the patient, using Health Leads like any other sub-specialty referral.", "en": " \"你的食物夠不夠每月所需？ 你有安全的住處嗎？\" 因此當醫生診療時 他知道病人的身高、體重、家裡存糧的狀況 他的家庭是否住在安全的地方 這些問題不只讓診療結果更好 醫生也能開給病患他們所需的資源 藉由導向健康或其他組織的幫助"}, {"zh-tw": " The problem is, once you get a taste of what it's like to realize your aspiration for healthcare, you want more. So we thought, if we can get individual doctors to prescribe these basic resources for their patients, could we get an entire healthcare system to shift its presumption? And we gave it a shot.", "en": " 問題是 當你嚐到 實現對健保制度的期望的滋味 你會想要更多 因此我們想: 如果我們可以讓每位醫生 開基本的生活資源給患者 我們是否能讓整個健保制度 改變它先入為主的態度? 所以我們決定一試"}, {"zh-tw": " So now at Harlem Hospital Center when patients come in with an elevated body mass index, the electronic medical record automatically generates a prescription for Health Leads. And our volunteers can then work with them to connect patients to healthy food and excercise programs in their communities.", "en": " 現在，哈林醫學中心 當前來的病患測出有過高身體質量指數(BMI)時 電子醫療記錄 自動產生處方給導向健康組織 而我們的志工即可協助 讓病患取得他們的社區中 健康飲食與運動計畫"}, {"zh-tw": " We've created a presumption that if you're a patient at that hospital with an elevated BMI, the four walls of the doctor's office probably aren't going to give you everything you need to be healthy. You need more.", "en": " 我們創造出這個假設: 如果你去醫院 身體質量指數很高 在醫院裡 你可能無法得到你需要的 你需要健康 你需要更多"}, {"zh-tw": " So on the one hand, this is just a basic recoding of the electronic medical record. And on the other hand, it's a radical transformation of the electronic medical record from a static repository of diagnostic information to a health promotion tool.", "en": " 所以一方面 這只是基本重新設計 電子醫療的記錄程式 另一方面 這是大規模的改變 對電子醫療記錄而言 從靜態儲存診斷記錄 變成推廣健康的工具"}, {"zh-tw": " In the private sector, when you squeeze that kind of additional value out of a fixed-cost investment, it's called a billion-dollar company. But in my world, it's called reduced obesity and diabetes.", "en": " 在私營部門 當你從固定成本的投資中 找出這樣的附加價值 這被稱做高盈利公司 但在我的世界裡 這被稱做減少肥胖和糖尿病"}, {"zh-tw": " It's called healthcare -- a system where doctors can prescribe solutions to improve health, not just manage disease. Same thing in the clinic waiting room.", "en": " 這就是健保 讓醫生能開好處方的系統 讓病人改善健康 不只是控制病情 在醫院的候診室也是如此"}, {"zh-tw": " So every day in this country three million patients pass through about 150,000 clinic waiting rooms in this country.
