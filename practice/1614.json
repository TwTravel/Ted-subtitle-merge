And it's called affordability.", "en": " 接著我馬上問她：「為什麼你用這麼不衛生的方法？」 她說：「我也知道衛生棉這種東西， 但是如果我還有我的姊妹們開始使用衛生棉， 我們就必須減少家中買牛奶的開支。」 我聽了很震驚。用衛生棉和買牛奶的錢 之間有什麼關係？ 這就被稱作「負擔能力」。"}, {"zh-tw": " I tried to impress my new wife by offering her a packet of sanitary pads.

Because it's an arranged marriage, not a love marriage.", "en": " 閉上眼睛。」 我試著將它變得很親密。 因為我們是被指定結婚的，不是因為相愛而結婚的。"}, {"zh-tw": " So one day she said, openly, I'm not going to support this research. Then other victims, they got into my sisters.", "en": " 於是有一天她坦白地說她不會支持我的研究。 剩下的受害者就是我的姊妹們。"}, {"zh-tw": " But even sisters, wives, they're not ready to support in the research.

I filled animal blood in a football bottle, I tied it up here, there is a tube going into my panties, while I'm walking, while I'm cycling, I made a press, doses of blood will go there.

That is my invention.", "en": " 投過它，任何鄉村的女人可以用相同的原料， 像是他們在幾千萬廠房內處理的原料， 任何人都可以在你家餐廳製作世界級的餐巾。 這就是我的發明。"}, {"zh-tw": " So after that, what I did, usually if anyone got a patent or an invention, immediately you want to make, convert into this. I never did this. I dropped it just like this, because you do this, if anyone runs after money, their life will not [have] any beauty. It is boredom.", "en": " 在那之後，我做的事情是這樣的， 通常如果有人發明了什麼 你立刻想要把它申請專利。 我從沒這麼做。我把它像這樣丟下， 因為如果汲汲營營的人這麼做了， 他們的生命一點都不美麗。有的只是無趣。"}, {"zh-tw": " A lot of people making a lot of money, billion, billions of dollars accumulating. Why are they coming for, finally, for philanthropy? Why the need for accumulating money, then doing philanthropy? What if one decided to start philanthropy from the day one?
