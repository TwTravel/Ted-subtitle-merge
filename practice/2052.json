I'm a molecular biologist by training, and I've seen a lot of these kinds of drawings. They're usually referred to as a model figure, a drawing that shows how we think a cellular or molecular process occurs.", "en": " 請大家看這張圖 你知道這是什麼嗎？ 我是一個分子生物學家 我看過很多這種圖 通常是分子模型圖 用來說明 細胞或分子的分裂過程"}, {"zh-tw": " This particular drawing is of a process called clathrin-mediated endocytosis. It's a process by which a molecule can get from the outside of the cell to the inside by getting captured in a bubble or a vesicle that then gets internalized by the cell.", "en": " 這張圖是在說明 一個由網格蛋白介導的胞吞作用的過程 透過這個過程 一個分子可以從細胞外進入細胞內 它先被一個泡囊包覆 然後再被吞入細胞內"}, {"zh-tw": " There's a problem with this drawing, though, and it's mainly in what it doesn't show. From lots of experiments, from lots of different scientists, we know a lot about what these molecules look like, how they move around in the cell, and that this is all taking place in an incredibly dynamic environment.", "en": " 但是 這張圖有一個問題 而且從圖中看不出來 從許多實驗 以及科學家的研究中 我們知道這些分子長什麼樣子 知道它們如何在細胞內移動 而且這都發生在 令人難以置信的動態環境中"}, {"zh-tw": " So in collaboration with a clathrinexpert Tomas Kirchhausen, we decided to create a new kind of model figure that showed all of that. So we start outside of the cell.", "en": " 因此 我們和網格蛋白專家Tomas Kirchhausen合作 要創造一種新的分子模型圖 來說明一切 我們從細胞外開始"}, {"zh-tw": " Now we're looking inside. Clathrin are these three-legged molecules that can self-assemble into soccer-ball-like shapes.", "en": " 現在我們來看細胞內 這些三隻腳的分子是網格蛋白 它們可以自我組成像足球的形狀"}, {"zh-tw": " Through connections with a membrane, clathrin is able to deform the membrane and form this sort of a cup that forms this sort of a bubble, or a vesicle, that's now capturing some of the proteins that were outside of the cell. Proteins are coming in now thatbasically pinch off this vesicle, making it separate from the rest of the membrane, and now clathrin is basically done with its job, and so proteins are coming in now — we've covered them yellow and orange — that are responsible for takingapart this clathrin cage.", "en": " 透過與細胞膜的連結 網格蛋白會使連結膜變形 形成這種杯子狀 然後形成這種小泡 並開始吞入 原本在細胞外的蛋白質 被吞入的蛋白質 將小泡與膜分離 此時網格蛋白的任務基本上已完成 蛋白質已進入細胞內 我們用黃色和橘色表示 它們負責將網格蛋白分解"}, {"zh-tw": " And so all of these proteinscan get basically recycled and used all over again. These processes are too small to be seen directly, even with the best microscopes, so animations like this provide a really powerful way of visualizing a hypothesis.", "en": " 基本上所有這些蛋白質 可以回收再利用 這些過程太小以致於無法直接觀察 即使用最好的顯微鏡也看不到 因此 這樣的動畫提供了一個好方法 使科學假設可視化"}, {"zh-tw": " Here's another illustration, and this is a drawing of how a researcher might think that the HIV virus gets into and out of cells. And again, this is a vast oversimplification and doesn't begin to show what we actually know about these processes.", "en": " 這裡還有一張圖 這張圖說明了研究人員 是如何想像HIV病毒進出細胞內外的 但這是個過於簡單的說明 並沒有表達出 我們實際上對這些過程的了解"}, {"zh-tw": " You might be surprised to know that these simple drawings are the only way that most biologists visualizetheir molecular hypotheses. Why? Because creating movies of processes as we think they actually occur is really hard.", "en": " 你可能覺得訝異 這些簡單的圖竟是 大部分生物學家畫出分子假設的唯一方法 為什麼？ 因為 依照我們認為的實際過程 來設計這些移動是非常困難的"}, {"zh-tw": " I spent months in Hollywoodlearning 3D animation software, and I spend months on each animation, and that's just time that mostresearchers can't afford. The payoffs can be huge, though.", "en": " 我花了幾個月在好萊塢學習3D動畫軟體 每個動畫又各花費了我一段時間 而大部分研究人員 並沒有時間去學習 不過 這個報酬是可觀的"}, {"zh-tw": " Molecular animations are unparalleled in their ability to convey a great deal of information to broad audiences with extreme accuracy. And I'm working on a new project now called \"The Science of HIV\" where I'll be animating the entire life cycle of the HIV virus as accurately as possible and all in molecular detail.", "en": " 分子動畫無與倫比 它可以向大眾傳達豐富的資訊 並且準確無誤 我正在進行一個新的計畫 叫做\"HIV的科學\" 我會以動畫盡可能準確地呈現出 HIV病毒的完整生命循環 以及詳細的分子資訊"}, {"zh-tw": " The animation will feature data from thousands of researcherscollected over decades, data on what this virus looks like, how it's able to infect cells in our body, and how therapeutics arehelping to combat infection. Over the years, I found that animations aren't just useful for communicating an idea, but they're also really useful for exploring a hypothesis.", "en": " 這個動畫將呈現出 眾多研究人員數十年來蒐集到的資料 包括病毒長什麼樣子 它如何感染我們體內的細胞 以及醫學治療如何幫助我們對付感染 多年來 我發現 動畫不僅可協助溝通 更有助於 探討假設"}, {"zh-tw": " Biologists for the most part arestill using a paper and pencil to visualize the processes they study, and with the data we have now,that's just not good enough anymore. The process of creating an animation can act as a catalyst that allows researchers to crystalize and refine their own ideas.", "en": " 生物學家大多仍在使用紙筆 畫出他們所研究的過程 但以我們現在擁有的資料來說這種方式不再足夠 設計動畫的過程 可以促進研究人員 將自己的想法具體化 並進一步精煉"}, {"zh-tw": " One researcher I worked with who works on the molecular mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases came up with experiments that were related directly to the animation thatshe and I worked on together, and in this way, animation canfeed back into the research process. I believe that animation can change biology.", "en": " 有一名我合作過的研究人員 她的研究是 神經退化性疾病的分子機制 她想出一些實驗 跟我們共同創作的動畫相關 這使得動畫可以回饋在研究過程上 我相信動畫可以改變生物學"}, {"zh-tw": " It can change the way that wecommunicate with one another, how we explore our data and how we teach our students. But for that change to happen, we need more researchers creating animations, and toward that end, I brought together a team of biologists, animators and programmers to create a new, free, open-source software — we call it Molecular Flipbook — that's created just for biologists just to create molecular animations.", "en": " 它可以改變我們的溝通方式 研究數據的方式 以及教育學生的方式 但是要讓這樣的改變發生 我們需要更多的研究人員去設計動畫 因此 我發起組成了一個團隊 包括生物學家 動畫人員以及程式人員 設計一個新的 免費的 開放原始碼的軟體 我們稱為\"分子的Flipbook\" 專門讓生物學家使用 用於設計分子動畫"}, {"zh-tw": " From our testing, we've foundthat it only takes 15 minutes for a biologist who has nevertouched animation software before to create her first molecular animation of her own hypothesis. We're also building an online database where anyone can view, download and contribute their own animations.", "en": " 從測試中 我們發現只需要15分鐘 就可以使從未接觸過動畫軟體的生物學家 設計出她的第一個分子動畫 來說明她的研究假設 我們也在建置線上資料庫 任何人都可以瀏覽 下載 以及分享他們自己的動畫"}, {"zh-tw": " We're really excited to announce that the beta version of the molecular animation software toolkit will be available for download today. We are really excited to seewhat biologists will create with it and what new insights they're able to gain from finally being able to animate their own model figures.", "en": " 我們很興奮地要告訴大家 這個分子動畫軟體工具包的試用版 在今天就可以下載使用 我們很期待生物學家的創作 以及他們可以獲得什麼樣的新啟發 而這個啟發來自於 得以將自己的分子模型以動畫來呈現"}, {"zh-tw": " Thank you.", "en": " 謝謝"}], "title": "Janet Iwasa How Animations Can Help Scientists Test A Hypothesis"}
