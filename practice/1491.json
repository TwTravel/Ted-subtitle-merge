Actually, I argue that there is another revolution going on, and it's the one that has to do with open-source hardware and the maker's movement, because the printer that my friend used to print the toy is actually open-source.", "en": " 像這樣 用電子設備創作東西 的理念 《經濟學人》雜誌稱其為 第三次工業革命 但我認為現在我們還經歷著另一場革命 一場涉及 開源硬體和創客的運動 因為我的朋友使用的這台印表機 實際上就是開源的"}, {"zh-tw": " So you go to the same website, you can download all the files that you need in order to make that printer: the construction files, the hardware, the software, all the instruction is there. And also this is part of a large community where there are thousands of people around the world that are actually making these kinds of printers, and there's a lot of innovation happening because it's all open-source.", "en": " 任何人去這一網站都可以下載 製作這台印表機所需要的各種檔： 施工檔、 硬體、 軟體 各種幫助都可以在網上找到 這是一個很大的線上社區 世界各地成千上萬的人 都聚集在這裡 製作像這樣的印表機 創新時刻都在發生 因為一切都是開源的"}, {"zh-tw": " You don't need anybody's permission to create something great. And that space is like the personal computer in 1976, like the Apples with the other companies are fighting, and we will see in a few years, there will be the Apple of this kind of market come out.", "en": " 你不需要徵求任何人的同意，就可以製作很棒的東西 這種市場的問世 就像1976年個人電腦問世一樣 蘋果公司和其他電腦公司互相競爭 幾年後我們也會看到 這種市場中的蘋果公司出現"}, {"zh-tw": " Well, there's also another interesting thing. I said the electronics are open-source, because at the heart of this printer there is something I'm really attached to: these Arduino boards, the motherboard that sort of powers this printer, is a project I've been working on for the past seven years.", "en": " 同樣有趣的是 就像我說的，所有的電子元件都是開源的 這台機器的關鍵元件 是我個人最為關心的 Arduino主機板 這台印表機的核心部分 這是我的一個項目 已經開展七年了"}, {"zh-tw": " It's an open-source project. I worked with these friends of mine that I have here.", "en": " 是一個開源項目 我和這些朋友一起合作"}, {"zh-tw": " So the five of us, two Americans, two Italians and a Spaniard, we — You know, it's a worldwide project. So we came together in this design institute called the Interaction Design Institute Ivrea, which was teaching interaction design, this idea that you can take design from the simple shape of an object and you can move it forward to design the way you interact with things.", "en": " 一共五個人，兩個美國人，兩個義大利人 一個西班牙人(也指一種植物) 這確實，是一個全球項目 我們都在（義大利）伊夫雷亞 互動設計研究所工作 這個研究所 研究的是如何 設計出 形狀簡單 但能夠與人互動的設備"}, {"zh-tw": " Well, when you design an object that's supposed to interact with a human being, if you make a foam model of a mobile phone, it doesn't make any sense. You have to have something that actually interacts with people.", "en": " 這種設備 能夠與人互動 如果僅僅製作一個手機的泡沫模型，這沒什麼意義 我們製作出來的東西 要與人互動才有意義"}, {"zh-tw": " So, we worked on Arduino and a lot of other projects there to create platforms that would be simple for our students to use, so that our students could just build things that worked, but they don't have five years to become an electronics engineer. We have one month. So how do I make something that even a kid can use? And actually, with Arduino, we have kids like Sylvia that you see here, that actually make projects with Arduino.", "en": " 因此，我們開發了Arduino 以及其他一些項目 這就給我們的學生建立了簡易的平臺 方便他們使用 讓他們有機會製作一些實用的東西 不過他們沒有五年的時間成為電子工程師，我們只有一個月時間 那麼，如何製作一個孩子都能用的東西呢？ 實際上，在Arduino的幫助下 像你看到的這個孩子Sylvia 就能做出自己的東西"}, {"zh-tw": " I have 11-year-old kids stop me and show me stuff they built for Arduino that's really scary to see the capabilities that kids have when you give them the tools. So let's look at what happens when you make a tool that anybody can just pick up and build something quickly, so one of the examples that I like to sort of kick off this discussion is this example of this cat feeder.", "en": " 才11歲的孩子 就能用Arduino做東西 我感覺，一旦給了這些孩子工具 他們表現出來的能力真的讓人有些害怕 讓我們看看一些實例 有了這樣一個工具 任何人都可以 在它的幫助下很快製作想要的東西 先看第一個例子 這是一個給貓咪餵食的容器"}, {"zh-tw": " The gentleman who made this project had two cats. One was sick and the other one was healthy, so he had to make sure they ate the proper food.", "en": " 這個設計的主人有兩隻貓 其中有一隻生病了 所以他必須讓它們 分開吃東西"}, {"zh-tw": " So he made this thing that recognizes the cat from a chip mounted inside on the collar of the cat, and opens the door and the cat can eat the food. This is made by recycling an old CD player that you can get from an old computer, some cardboard, tape, couple of sensors, a few blinking LEDs, and then suddenly you have a tool. You build something that you cannot find on the market.", "en": " 於是他設計了這個裝置 通過貓咪項圈內安裝的晶片 識別貓咪身份 然後開門讓貓咪吃東西 這個裝置使用了一張用過的CD播放機 從一台舊電腦拆下來的 還有一些紙板、膠帶、幾個感測器和閃爍的LED顯示幕 就做好了這樣一個工具 一個市場上買不到的東西"}, {"zh-tw": " And I like this phrase: \"Scratch your own itch.\" If you have an idea, you just go and you make it. This is the equivalent of sketching on paper done with electronics.", "en": " 有句話說的好：“撓自己的癢” 如果有自己的想法，就得動手去實現 這就像在紙上畫畫一樣 只不過是用電子裝置完成的"}, {"zh-tw": " So one of the features that I think is important about our work is that our hardware, on top of being made with love in Italy — as you can see from the back of the circuit — is that it's open, so we publish all the design files for the circuit online, so you can download it and you can actually use it to make something, or to modify, to learn. You know, when I was learning about programming, I learned by looking at other people's code, or looking at other people's circuits in magazines.", "en": " 這個項目 很重要的一個特點 在於硬體 當然首先是義大利傾情製造的 從電路的背面 可以看到 更重要的是它是開源的 我們把所有的設計檔 都發佈在網上 任何人都可以下載 在指引下進行製作 或者改裝，學習 我當初學習程式設計的時候 就是通過看其他人的代碼學習的 或看其他人發表在雜誌上的電路圖"}, {"zh-tw": " And this is a good way to learn, by looking at other people's work. So the different elements of the project are all open, so the hardware is released with a Creative Commons license.", "en": " 通過看其他人的作品來學習 這是一種很好的學習方式 這個專案的各個元件都是開源的 比如硬體 就是在“知識共用授權合約”下公開發佈的"}, {"zh-tw": " So, you know, I like this idea that hardware becomes like a piece of culture that you share and you build upon, like it was a song or a poem with Creative Commons. Or, the software is GPL, so it's open-source as well.", "en": " 我喜歡這種理念 把硬體作為文化的一部分供大家分享和使用 就像歌曲或詩歌一樣 只不過擁有“知識共用”認證 另外，軟體通過“通用公共許可”發佈，也是開源的"}, {"zh-tw": " The documentation and the hands-on teaching methodology is also open-source and released as the Creative Commons. Just the name is protected so that we can make sure that we can tell people what is Arduino and what isn't.", "en": " 各種檔和動手教學資源 都是開源的，遵循“知識共用授權合約” 這個協議只對專案的名稱起保護作用 便於我們能告訴大家 Arduino到底是什麼"}, {"zh-tw": " Now, Arduino itself is made of a lot of different open-source components that maybe individually are hard to use for a 12-year-old kid, so Arduino wraps everything together into a mashup of open-source technologies where we try to give them the best user experience to get something done quickly. So you have situations like this, where some people in Chile decided to make their own boards instead of buying them, to organize a workshop and to save money. Or there are companies that make their own variations of Arduino that fit in a certain market, and there's probably, maybe like a 150 of them or something at the moment.", "en": " 目前，Arduino包含 很多不同的開源組件 這些元件拆開來對於一個12歲的孩子使用起來太難了 所以Arduino 將這些元件組合成在一起 呈現出一個整體的開源工具 讓用戶們很快就能做好一個東西 給他們最好的用戶體驗 讓我們看看一些例子 在智利，一些用戶 決定自己製作電路板，而不去商店買 建立自己的工作間 或者為了省錢 也有一些公司對Arduino 做出一些修改 以迎合某個市場的需要 像這樣的改裝 目前大概有150個"}, {"zh-tw": " This one is made by a company called Adafruit, which is run by this woman called Limor Fried, also known as Ladyada, who is one of the heroes of the open-source hardware movement and the maker movement.

Or you have websites, like this one, like Instructables, where people actually teach each other about anything.", "en": " 這是一本叫《Make》的雜誌 讓很多志趣相投的人 走到一起組成一個社區 在這裡，複雜的項目 通過簡單易懂的語言展示出來，板式也很漂亮 也有一些網站，比如這個 名叫Instructables 人們在這裡互相教學"}, {"zh-tw": " So this one is about Arduino projects, the page you see on the screen, but effectively here you can learn how to make a cake and everything else. So let's look at some projects.", "en": " 我們現在看到的頁面 正是關於Arduino專案的 其實在這個網站你可以學到各式各樣的東西，比如做蛋糕 現在讓我們看看其他例子"}, {"zh-tw": " So this one is a quadcopter. It's a small model helicopter.", "en": " 這是一個四軸飛行器 一個小型的直升機模型"}, {"zh-tw": " In a way, it's a toy, no? And so this one was military technology a few years ago, and now it's open-source, easy to use, you can buy it online. DIY Drones is the community; they do this thing called ArduCopter.", "en": " 差不多是個玩具吧 幾年前這還是軍方掌握的技術 現在已經開源了 使用方便，網上都買的到 這個網站叫DIY Drones，他們設計了一種叫ArduCopter的飛行器"}, {"zh-tw": " But then somebody actually launched this start-up called Matternet, where they figured out that you could use this to actually transport things from one village to another in Africa, and the fact that this was easy to find, open-source, easy to hack, enabled them to prototype their company really quickly. Or, other projects. Matt Richardson: I'm getting a little sick of hearing about the same people on TV over and over and over again, so I decided to do something about it.", "en": " 後來有人搞了一個叫Matternet的創業項目 他們發現 可以用這個飛行器 在非洲的村莊間運送物資 正是因為資料好找 都是開源的，且易上手 他們很快便成立了公司 同樣，看看這個項目 “老是聽這些人出現在電視裡講話” “煩死我了，所以我決定採取點行動“"}, {"zh-tw": " This Arduino project, which I call the Enough Already, will mute the TV anytime any of these over-exposed personalities is mentioned. I'll show you how I made it.", "en": " ”於是我做了這個Arduino項目” “我把它叫做“夠了！” “它能在這些上鏡頻率過高的人出現的時候” “自動將電視靜音” “我來演示一下這是怎麼做的”"}, {"zh-tw": " MB: Check this out.

So, you know, again, what is interesting here is that Matt found this module that lets Arduino process TV signals, he found some code written by somebody else that generates infrared signals for the TV, put it together and then created this great project. It's also used, Arduino's used, in serious places like, you know, the Large Hadron Collider.", "en": " 好。有趣的是 Matt找到了一個模組 可以讓Arduino處理電視信號 同時他還找到了別人寫的一些代碼 這些代碼可以向電視傳送紅外信號 他把找到的這些東西組合在一起，做了這個有趣的東西 當然，Arduino也用在 一些正式的地方，比如大型強子對撞機"}, {"zh-tw": " There's some Arduino balls collecting data and sort of measuring some parameters.

Because it was a student project becoming a product.", "en": " 這裡有Arduino的部件 在進行一些資料收集 以及參數測量的工作 還可以用在這裡 （音樂） 這是一個音樂互動媒體 一個義大利學生製作的 目前他正準備將它商業化 這是一個例子 學生的專案轉變為了產品"}, {"zh-tw": " Or it can be used to make an assistive device. This is a glove that understands the sign language and transforms the gestures you make into sounds and writes the words that you're signing on a display And again, this is made of all different parts you can find on all the websites that sell Arduino-compatible parts, and you assemble it into a project.", "en": " 另外一個例子。這是一個輔助裝置 這個手套能夠識別手語 能將人作出的手勢 轉化成聲音 還可以把字顯示在自帶的螢幕上 同樣，這也是靠不同部件組成的 這些部件和Arduino相容 都能在網上買到 組合在一起便是成品"}, {"zh-tw": " Or this is a project from the ITP part of NYU, where they met with this boy who has a severe disability, cannot play with the PS3, so they built this device that allows the kid to play baseball although he has limited movement capability.

Then we have this plant here.", "en": " 對 再看看這顆植物"}, {"zh-tw": " This is called Botanicalls, because there's an Arduino ball with a Wi-Fi module in the plant, and it's measuring the well-being of the plant, and it's creating a Twitter account where you can actually interact with the plant.

When the Fukushima disaster happened, a bunch of people in Japan, they realized that the information that the government was giving wasn't really open and really reliable, so they built this Geiger counter, plus Arduino, plus network interface.
