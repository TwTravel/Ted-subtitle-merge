I want to debut a new song that I've been working on in the last five or six months.", "en": " 那麼，我今天想做點特別的事。 我想演唱一首新歌，這首歌是 在過去五個或六個月內創作的。"}, {"zh-tw": " And there's few things more thrilling than playing a song for the first time in front of an audience, especially when it's half-finished. I'm kind of hoping some conversations here might help me finish it.", "en": " 沒有什麼比在觀眾 面前第一次演唱一首歌 更讓人激動的了， 尤其是這首歌是半成品。 我希望在這兒能產生些交流 也許能幫我完成它。"}, {"zh-tw": " Because it gets into all sorts of crazy realms. And so this is basically a song about loops, but not the kind of loops that I make up here.", "en": " 因為它進入了一種 瘋狂的境界。 基本上，這是首關於 迴圈的歌， 但不是我在這兒做的這種迴圈。"}, {"zh-tw": " They're feedback loops. And in the audio world that's when the microphone gets too close to its sound source, and then it gets in this self-destructive loop that creates a very unpleasant sound.", "en": " 它是回饋迴圈。 在音頻的世界裏， 當麥克風離它的 音源太近時， 它會產生自我消音的迴圈， 這會產生讓人非常不舒服的聲音。"}, {"zh-tw": " And I'm going to demonstrate for you. I'm not going to hurt you. Don't worry.", "en": " 我將向你們展示一下。 我不會傷害你們。別擔心。"}, {"zh-tw": " ♫ This is a loop, feedback loop ♫ ♫ This is a loop, feedback loop ♫ ♫ This is a loop, feedback loop ♫ ♫ This is a loop, feedback loop ♫ ♫ This is a loop, feedback loop ♫ ♫ This is a loop, feedback loop ♫ ♫ This is a -- (Feedback) All right.

So like, you can't feed cows their own brains or you get mad cow disease, and inbreeding and incest and, let's see, what's the other one? Biological -- there's autoimmune diseases, where the body attacks itself a little too overzealously and destroys the host, or the person.", "en": " 自然中似乎有個規則： 如果你距離你所來的地方太近， 就會變得醜陋。 就像，你不能用牛的大腦來餵牛， 不然就會出現狂牛症， 還有近親結婚和亂倫， 讓我們看看， 還有什麼？ 生物學上 -- 自身免疫的疾病， 就是由於身體自我攻擊 有點過於激烈， 把宿主或是人 給摧毀了。"}, {"zh-tw": " And then -- okay, this is where we get to the song -- kind of bridges the gap to the emotional. Because although I've used scientific terms in songs, it's very difficult sometimes to make them lyrical.", "en": " 接下來 -- 好了，再演奏首歌曲 -- 有點像情感空白間的聯繫。 因為儘管我在歌中使用了 科學名詞， 有時還是很難讓它表現得很抒情。"}, {"zh-tw": " And there's some things you just don't need to have in songs. So I'm trying to bridge this gap between this idea and this melody.", "en": " 而有些東西 不需要放在歌中。 因此，我試著在這個想法和這首曲子 之間建個聯繫。"}, {"zh-tw": " And so, I don't know if you've ever had this, but when I close my eyes sometimes and try to sleep, I can't stop thinking about my own eyes. And it's like your eyes start straining to see themselves.", "en": " 雖然我不知道你們是否有過這種感覺， 但有時當我閉上雙眼 試著睡著時， 我情不自禁的想到我的雙眼。 就像你的眼睛 開始練習看著自己。"}, {"zh-tw": " That's what it feels like to me. It's not pleasant.", "en": " 這就是我所感覺到的。 不是很愉快的感覺。"}, {"zh-tw": " I'm sorry if I put that idea in your head. It's impossible, of course, for your eyes to see themselves, but they seem to be trying.", "en": " 如果我讓你有這種感覺的話，我很抱歉。 當然，讓眼睛看自己是不可能的。 但它們似乎在做這種嘗試。"}, {"zh-tw": " So that's getting a little more closer to a personal experience. Or ears being able to hear themselves -- it's just impossible.", "en": " 這是種個人的體驗。 或許耳朵也能夠聆聽它們自己-- 這也是不可能的；"}, {"zh-tw": " That's the thing. So, I've been working on this song that mentions these things and then also imagines a person who's been so successful at defending themselves from heartbreak that they're left to do the deed themselves, if that's possible.", "en": " 就是這樣。 那麼，我創作的這首歌中 提到了這些事情 還有想像， 想像一個人成功地 抵禦了他們留給自己的 難以忍耐的悲傷， 如果可能的話。"}, {"zh-tw": " And that's what the song is asking. All right.", "en": " 這就是這首歌所追問的。 好了。"}, {"zh-tw": " It doesn't have a name yet.

It's kind of cool. Songwriters can sort of get away with murder.", "en": " 好了。 有點酷。歌曲作者可以逃脫謀殺。"}, {"zh-tw": " You can throw out crazy theories and not have to back it up with data or graphs or research.
