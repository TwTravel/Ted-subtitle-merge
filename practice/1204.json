Buildings are complex ecosystems that are an important source of microbes that are good for us, and some that are bad for us.", "en": " 生活在已開發國家中的人們 超過百分之90的時間待在室內， 他們呼吸且接觸 肉眼看不見的無數生物： 微生物。 建築物是複雜的生態系統， 也是人們取得微生物的重要來源， 不論是好的， 還是不好的微生物。"}, {"zh-tw": " What determines the types and distributions of microbes indoors? Buildings are colonized by airborne microbes that enter through windows and through mechanical ventilation systems. And they are brought inside by humans and other creatures.", "en": " 什麼因素決定了室內微生物的 種類和分布？ 佔據在建築物內的空氣傳播微生物 經由窗戶 和機械通風裝置進入室內。 也經由人類和其它生物 帶入室內。"}, {"zh-tw": " The fate of microbes indoors depends on complex interactions with humans, and with the human-built environment. And today, architects and biologists are working together to explore smart building design that will create healthy buildings for us.", "en": " 室內微生物的命運 取決於 其與人類的互動 和與人造環境的互動 現今，建築師和生物學家 一起合作 探索聰慧的建築設計 以創造 對人們健康的建築物。"}, {"zh-tw": " We spend an extraordinary amount of time in buildings that are extremely controlled environments, like this building here -- environments that have mechanical ventilation systems that include filtering, heating and air conditioning. Given the amount of time that we spend indoors, it's important to understand how this affects our health.", "en": " 我們花非常大量的時間 待在建築物內， 建築物是被高度控制的環境， 像這座建築物-- 裝設有機械通風系統 包括過濾， 暖氣和空氣調節設備。 考量到我們待在室內的時間， 了解這如何影響我們的健康 是很重要的事。"}, {"zh-tw": " At the Biology and the Built Environment Center, we carried out a study in a hospital where we sampled air and pulled the DNA out of microbes in the air. And we looked at three different types of rooms.", "en": " 在這座生物和人造環境中心裡， 我們進行一項醫院內的研究， 我們取樣醫院裡的空氣， 從空氣中的微生物 擷取DNA。 我們著眼於三種不同類型的房間。"}, {"zh-tw": " We looked at rooms that were mechanically ventilated, which are the data points in the blue. We looked at rooms that were naturally ventilated, where the hospital let us turn off the mechanical ventilation in a wing of the building and pry open the windows that were no longer operable, but they made them operable for our study.", "en": " 有機械通風設備的房間 是圖表中的藍數據點。 我們研究自然通風的地方 是醫院允許我們關閉機械通風設備的房間 它們位於醫院的側翼 我們翹開的窗戶 實際上早已不能使用， 為了我們的研究，醫院恢復它們的功能。"}, {"zh-tw": " And we also sampled the outdoor air. If you look at the x-axis of this graph, you'll see that what we commonly want to do -- which is keeping the outdoors out -- we accomplished that with mechanical ventilation.", "en": " 我們也從戶外空氣中取樣。 如果你看此表的X軸， 可觀察到我們普通的作法-- 把戶外空氣排除在外-- 我們藉由機械通風達成此目的。"}, {"zh-tw": " So if you look at the green data points, which is air that's outside, you'll see that there's a large amount of microbial diversity, or variety of microbial types. But if you look at the blue data points, which is mechanically ventilated air, it's not as diverse.", "en": " 如果你看表中的綠數據點， 這是戶外的空氣， 你可看到有大量的微生物多樣性， 或者多樣化的微生物種類。 但如果你看藍數據點， 它們代表機械通風的空氣， 種類沒那麼多樣化。"}, {"zh-tw": " But being less diverse is not necessarily good for our health. If you look at the y-axis of this graph, you'll see that, in the mechanically ventilated air, you have a higher probability of encountering a potential pathogen, or germ, than if you're outdoors.", "en": " 但是種類少 不一定對我們的健康有益處。 如果你看表中的Y軸， 你可看到，機械通風的空氣中， 你有較高的可能性 會接觸到潛在的病原體， 或病菌， 在戶外時，可能性反而較小"}, {"zh-tw": " So to understand why this was the case, we took our data and put it into an ordination diagram, which is a statistical map that tells you something about how related the microbial communities are in the different samples. The data points that are closer together have microbial communities that are more similar than data points that are far apart.", "en": " 為了瞭解其背後的原因， 我們把這些資料 排列在序列分布圖中， 形成一個統計地圖， 這個圖可告訴你 在不同的樣本中 微生物族群的關聯性。 位置相近的點 帶有較類似的微生物族群， 位置距離較遠的點則反之"}, {"zh-tw": " And the first things that you can see from this graph is, if you look at the blue data points, which are the mechanically ventilated air, they're not simply a subset of the green data points, which are the outdoor air. What we've found is that mechanically ventilated air looks like humans.", "en": " 可從此圖表中發現的第一件事是 如果你看這些藍數據點 它們代表機械通風的空氣， 他們不單純只是綠數據點的子集， 綠數據點代表戶外空氣。 我們所發現的是機械通風的空氣 看似人類的。"}, {"zh-tw": " It has microbes on it that are commonly associated with our skin and with our mouth, our spit. And this is because we're all constantly shedding microbes.", "en": " 漂浮其中的微生物 和我們的皮膚、嘴巴和唾液 有共通關連性。 這是因為 我們全部的人不斷地散播微生物。"}, {"zh-tw": " So all of you right now are sharing your microbes with one another. And when you're outdoors, that type of air has microbes that are commonly associated with plant leaves and with dirt.", "en": " 現在你們全部的人 正在彼此分享彼此的微生物。 當你們在戶外時， 空氣中所帶的微生物 和植物葉子還有土攘有關連性。"}, {"zh-tw": " Why does this matter? It matters because the health care industry is the second most energy intensive industry in the United States. Hospitals use two and a half times the amount of energy as office buildings.", "en": " 這為什麼重要呢？ 其重要性在於醫療保健產業 排名美國第二大 高耗能產業。 醫院所耗能源 是辦公建築物的2.5倍。"}, {"zh-tw": " And the model that we're working with in hospitals, and also with many, many different buildings, is to keep the outdoors out. And this model may not necessarily be the best for our health.", "en": " 現今醫院奉行的 典範， 同時也可見於很多不同建築之中， 是將戶外空氣排除在外。 而這個典範 不一定是對我們健康最有益處的。"}, {"zh-tw": " And given the extraordinary amount of nosocomial infections, or hospital-acquired infections, this is a clue that it's a good time to reconsider our current practices. So just as we manage national parks, where we promote the growth of some species and we inhibit the growth of others, we're working towards thinking about buildings using an ecosystem framework where we can promote the kinds of microbes that we want to have indoors.", "en": " 鑒於非常大量的 醫院感染， 或者經由醫院取得的感染， 這提醒我們，是時候 重新考慮目前的常規是否合適。 如同我們管理國家公園， 當我們促進一些物種的成長時， 我們也抑制其它物種的成長， 我們正把生態系統的架構 應用到建築的思維裡， 提升我們想要移到室內的 某些微生物種類。"}, {"zh-tw": " I've heard somebody say that you're as healthy as your gut. And for this reason, many people eat probiotic yogurt so they can promote a healthy gut flora.", "en": " 我聽過人說 你的健康取決於你的腸道健康。 因此很多人吃益生菌優格 就是為了促進健康的腸道菌叢。"}, {"zh-tw": " And what we ultimately want to do is to be able to use this concept to promote a healthy group of microorganisms inside. Thank you.", "en": " 我們的終極目標 是應用此概念 促進室內的 健康微生物群。 謝謝。"}], "title": "Jessica Green Are We Filtering The Wrong Microbes"}
