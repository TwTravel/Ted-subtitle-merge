It stops.", "en": " 你所知道的生活進入假死狀態 時間彷彿靜止不動了"}, {"zh-tw": " I'm going to steal a story from a friend of mine, a Bosnian friend, about what happened to her, because I think it will illustrate for you exactly what it feels like. She was walking to work one day in April, 1992, in a miniskirt and high heels. She worked in a bank.", "en": " 我要說一件發生在我朋友身上的故事 她是波斯尼亞人 是發生她身上的事 因為我想這樣就能告訴你們 戰爭是什麼樣子 1992年4月某日 她走路去上班 穿著迷女裙和高跟鞋 她在銀行上班"}, {"zh-tw": " She was a young mother. She was someone who liked to party.

And as she's hiding there, she's feeling ridiculous, but she's seeing this tank go by with soldiers and people all over the place and chaos and she thinks, \"I feel like Alice in Wonderland going down the rabbit hole, down, down, down into chaos, and my life will never be the same again.\" A few weeks later, my friend was in a crowd of people pushing with her infant son in her arms to give him to a stranger on a bus, which was one of the last buses leaving Sarajevo to take children out so they could be safe.", "en": " 她驚慌失措地逃跑 尋找掩蔽物 最後她躲在垃圾箱後面 穿著短裙和高跟鞋全身捲曲地縮在一起 躲在那裡的時候 她覺得這一切都太荒謬了 但是她看見這輛坦克車旁邊還有士兵護衛 所有人都慌張逃竄 一片混亂 她覺得自己好像身處艾莉絲夢遊仙境 要鑽進兔子洞 爬啊爬 爬到一片混亂的地方 我怎麼會這麼可憐 幾個星期之後 我朋友在一群人裡面 推擠掙扎著 當時抱著還是嬰兒的兒子 將他交給公車上的一位陌生人 這是最後開離塞拉耶佛的其中一班公車 把小孩送出去 讓他們安全"}, {"zh-tw": " And she remembers struggling with her mother to the front, crowds and crowds of people, \"Take my child!

I learned so much about myself.", "en": " 即使身處在毀滅 死亡和混亂之中 我學到就算是一般人 也能幫助他們的鄰居 分享食物 養育小孩 拖行路中間遭到狙擊致死的屍體 儘管自己都已經身陷險境 將受傷的人 送上計程車 試著把他們帶到醫院 我也更加了解自己"}, {"zh-tw": " Martha Gellhorn, who's one of my heroes, once said, \"You can only love one war.

It was a very somber gathering of the reporters that worked there during the war, humanitarian aid workers, and of course the brave and courageous people of Sarajevo themselves.", "en": " 就是在圍城20週年紀念日那天 也是塞拉耶佛圍城戰開戰的那天 我不喜歡\"周年紀念日\"這個詞，因為聽起來像要開派對 這不是在開派對 當時氣氛非常沉重 盤踞在記者頭上 他們在戰爭期間在當地採訪 人權人士也很沉重 當然 塞拉耶佛勇敢強韌的人民也是"}, {"zh-tw": " And the thing that struck me the most, that broke my heart, was walking down the main street of Sarajevo, where my friend Aida saw the tank coming 20 years ago, and in that road were more than 12,000 red chairs, empty, and every single one of them symbolized a person who had died during the siege, just in Sarajevo, not in all of Bosnia, and it stretched from one end of the city to a large part of it, and the saddest for me were the tiny little chairs for the children. I now cover Syria, and I started reporting it because I believed that it needs to be done.", "en": " 我最震驚的是 讓我心都碎了 沿著塞拉耶佛的大街走 20年前 我朋友Aida就是在那裡看到坦克車 就在那條路上擺著超過12000張紅椅子 是空的 每一張椅子都象徵 一位在圍城戰死亡的人 只有在塞拉耶佛有這項活動 不是波斯尼亞全國都有 活動範圍從城市裡的一部分 延伸到幾乎整座城市 看到很小張的椅子 我很難過 那是用來紀念小孩子的 我現在在敘利亞採訪 開始報導敘利亞戰爭 是因為我認為 有必要將事實傳達出來"}, {"zh-tw": " I believe a story there has to be told. I see, again, a template of the war in Bosnia.", "en": " 我覺得有必要向世界傳達 在波斯尼亞，我又看見戰爭的前兆"}, {"zh-tw": " And when I first arrived in Damascus, I saw this strange moment where people didn't seem to believe that war was going to descend, and it was exactly the same in Bosnia and nearly every other country I've seen where war comes. People don't want to believe it's coming, so they don't leave, they don't leave before they can.", "en": " 我第一次去大馬士革 我看到一個很奇怪的景象 人們似乎不相信戰爭即將爆發 就跟波斯尼亞 和其他即將發生戰爭的國家都是一樣情況 人們不願相信戰爭即將開始 所以他們不願撤離 要堅守到最後一刻"}, {"zh-tw": " They don't get their money out.

Fifty-six percent of the parliamentarians are women, which is fantastic, and there's also within the national constitution now, you're actually not allowed to say Hutu or Tutsi.", "en": " 從戰爭中 我們學到很多事情 我會提到盧旺達 因為它如同南非 戰爭持續了將近20多年 目前正在復元 國會議員有56%都是女性 這個現象還不錯 現在該國家憲法內也有相關規定 不能有胡圖族 圖西族之分"}, {"zh-tw": " You're not allowed to identify anyone by ethnicity, which is, of course, what started the slaughter in the first place.

So when people ask me how I continue to cover war, and why I continue to do it, this is why.", "en": " 他們只是心平氣和地團結在一起 我覺得很了不起 所以有人問我 在戰爭期間 我是怎麼採訪 為什麼要繼續當戰地記者? 這就是答案"}, {"zh-tw": " When I go back to Syria, next week in fact, what I see is incredibly heroic people, some of them fighting for democracy, for things we take for granted every single day. And that's pretty much why I do it.", "en": " 下星期我會回去敘利亞 事實上 我看到很多非常英勇的人 他們之中有人是為民主自由而戰 為我們每天視為理所當然的事情而戰 我會當記者 也差不多是因為這樣"}, {"zh-tw": " In 2004, I had a little baby boy, and I call him my miracle child, because after seeing so much death and destruction and chaos and darkness in my life, this ray of hope was born.

Why aren't you home with Luca?\" And I said, \"Well, I have to see.\" It was 2004 which was the beginning of the incredibly bloody time in Iraq, \"I have to see, I have to see what is happening here. I have to report it.\" And he said, \"Go home, because if you miss his first tooth, if you miss his first step, you'll never forgive yourself.", "en": " 我會談到他 是因為在他4個月大時 我的外籍編輯叫我回去巴格達 我一直都有報導與薩達姆政權有關的事情 在政權垮台前後 我記得我哭著上飛機 我會哭是因為要跟兒子分開了 還在那裡的時候 我朋友是一位伊拉克相當知名的政治人物 他對我說\"妳在這裡幹嘛?\" \"妳怎麼沒在家陪路卡\" 我說\"我必須親眼見證\" 那年是2004年 也是伊拉克血腥時代的開端 \"我必須親眼見證這裡即將發生的大事\" \"我要讓全世界都知道\" 他說\"妳趕快回家 因為如果妳錯過他長第一顆牙 沒看到他走的第一步 妳會非常後悔"}, {"zh-tw": " But there will always be another war.\" And there, sadly, will always be wars.

And that's what I try to do.", "en": " 我同事覺得這份工作就像一道希望之光 照亮世界最黑暗的角落 那也是我的理想"}, {"zh-tw": " I'm not always successful, and sometimes it's incredibly frustrating, because you feel like you're writing into a void, or you feel like no one cares. Who cares about Syria? Who cares about Bosnia? Who cares about the Congo, the Ivory Coast, Liberia, Sierra Leone, all of these strings of places that I will remember for the rest of my life?
