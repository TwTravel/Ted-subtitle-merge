So I decided to go see a therapist. I had been seeing her for a few months,when she looked at me one day and said, \"Who actually raised youuntil you were three?\" Seemed like a weird question.I said, \"My parents.\" And she said, \"I don't thinkthat's actually the case; because if it were, we'd be dealing with things that arefar more complicated than just this.\" It sounded like the setup to a joke,but I knew she was serious.", "en": " 大約十年前，我經歷了一段艱難的時期。 所以我決定去看心理醫生。 我持續去看了幾個月，有一天她看著我說： 「到底是誰把你扶養到三歲的？」 這問題好怪。我說：「我的父母。」 她說：「我不認為那是真的； 因為如果是真的， 那我們面對的問題將會更複雜。」 這聽起來像是設計好的笑話，但我知道她是認真的。"}, {"zh-tw": " Because when I first started seeing her, I was trying to bethe funniest person in the room. And I would try and crack these jokes,but she caught on to me really quickly, and whenever I tried to make a joke,she would look at me and say, \"That is actually really sad.\" It's terrible.", "en": " 因為從我一開始看這位心理醫生， 我就試著要成為房間裡最幽默的人。 我會試著說些笑話，但她馬上知道我要說什麼， 每當我試著要開玩笑，她就會看著我然後說： 「真的很可悲。」 真的很慘。"}, {"zh-tw": " So I knew I had to be serious,and I asked my parents who had actually raised meuntil I was three? And to my surprise, they said my primary caregiver had beena distant relative of the family. I had called her my auntie.", "en": " 我知道我要嚴肅起來，於是我問了我的父母 到底是誰把我扶養到三歲？ 出乎我的意料之外，他們說 主要照顧我的人，是我家族裡的一個遠親。 我叫她阿姨。"}, {"zh-tw": " I remember my auntie so clearly, it felt like she had been part of my lifewhen I was much older. I remember the thick, straight hair, and how it would come aroundme like a curtain when she bent to pick me up; her soft, southern Thai accent; the way I would cling to her, even if she just wanted to goto the bathroom or get something to eat.", "en": " 我記得非常清楚， 當我年紀大一些，感覺她是我生命的一部份。 我記得她那濃密的直髮， 當她彎腰抱我時 那頭髮就像窗簾布一樣包圍我； 記著她那柔軟的南方泰國口音； 我喜歡黏著她， 甚至她只是要去廁所， 或是拿點東西吃。"}, {"zh-tw": " I loved her, but [with] the ferocitythat a child has sometimes before she understands that lovealso requires letting go. But my clearest and sharpestmemory of my auntie, is also one of my firstmemories of life at all.", "en": " 我愛她，但殘忍的是有時一個小孩 不了解愛也是需要放手。 她在我腦海中留下最清晰的回憶， 也同時是我人生中最初的回憶之一。"}, {"zh-tw": " I remember her being beaten and slappedby another member of my family.

That story lets us off the hook.", "en": " 我們利用這個故事來說服我們自己 販賣人口是壞人對無辜的女子做壞事。 這個故事讓我們有台階下。"}, {"zh-tw": " It takes away all the societal contextthat we might be indicted for, for the structural inequality,or the poverty, or the barriers to migration. We let ourselves think that human trafficking is onlyabout forced prostitution, when in reality, human trafficking is embeddedin our everyday lives.", "en": " 它抺去所有可能被控訴的社會背景， 如結構性的不平等、貧窮、 或是遷徙的限制。 我們自己認為 人口販賣只是被迫賣淫， 但事實是， 人口販賣潛藏在我們的日常生活中。"}, {"zh-tw": " Let me show you what I mean. Forced prostitution accounts for22 percent of human trafficking.", "en": " 讓我來解釋給你們聽。 被迫賣淫佔人口販賣的百分之二十二。"}, {"zh-tw": " Ten percent is in state-imposed forced labor. but a whopping 68 percentis for the purpose of creating the goods and delivering the servicesthat most of us rely on every day, in sectors like agricultural work,domestic work and construction.", "en": " 百分之十為強制勞動。 但高達百分之六十八是從事生產產品 以及從事我們日常不可或缺的服務業， 像是農事，家事服務以及建造的工作。"}, {"zh-tw": " That is food and care and shelter.

This is a huge problem.", "en": " 人口販因此獲利近四百萬美金。 這是個大問題。"}, {"zh-tw": " So what have we done about it? We've mostly turnedto the criminal justice system. But keep in mind, most victims of humantrafficking are poor and marginalized.", "en": " 我們為此做了什麼？ 我們大都求助刑事司法系統。 但請記得，大部分人口販賣的受害者是貧窮和被邊緣化的人。"}, {"zh-tw": " They're migrants, people of color. Sometimes they're in the sex trade.", "en": " 他們是外籍勞工，有色人種。 有些從事賣淫。"}, {"zh-tw": " And for populations like these, the criminal justice system istoo often part of the problem, rather than the solution.
