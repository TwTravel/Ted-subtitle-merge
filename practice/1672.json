I went to school not because the Maasais' women or girls were going to school.", "en": " 我做了所有必須的做的 讓我成為一位完美的妻子 我去上學不是因為 馬賽族的女人或女孩子都會去上學。"}, {"zh-tw": " It's because my mother was denied an education, and she constantly reminded me and my siblings that she never wanted us to live the life she was living. Why did she say that? My father worked as a policeman in the city.", "en": " 而是因為我母親被剝奪了教育， 她就不斷地提醒我和我的兄弟姊妹們 她不想我們過她的過去的日子 為什麼她會這樣說呢？ 我父親在城裡當警察"}, {"zh-tw": " He came home once a year.

What do you need?\" As I spoke to the women, they told me, \"You know what we need? We really need a school for girls.\" Because there had not been any school for girls. And the reason they wanted the school for girls is because when a girl is raped when she's walking to school, the mother is blamed for that.", "en": " 我回去後，我開始跟男士們 跟村子，還有母親們說話，我說 ”我想尊守我的承諾， 我說我會回來幫忙，你需要什麼？“ 當我這樣跟婦女說，她們會告訴我， ”妳知道我們的需要什麼嗎? 我們很需要一所女子學校 因為那裡從沒有給女孩子的學校。 她們之所以想要一所女子學校 是因為當有女孩在上學途中被強暴 母親卻是被怪罪的一方"}, {"zh-tw": " If she got pregnant before she got married, the mother is blamed for that, and she's punished. She's beaten.", "en": " 如果她在結婚前懷孕 母親會被責怪而她會被懲罰 她會被打。"}, {"zh-tw": " They said, \"We wanted to put our girls in a safe place.\" As we moved, and I went to talk to the fathers, the fathers, of course, you can imagine what they said: \"We want a school for boys.\" And I said, \"Well, there are a couple of men from my village who have been out and they have gotten an education. Why can't they build a school for boys, and I'll build a school for girls?\" That made sense. And they agreed.", "en": " 她們會說：“我們需要把我們的女兒帶到一個安全的地方。” 然後我們搬了，我去跟父親們商量 理所當然 你可以猜他們說了什麼 我們要一所男子學校” 我說：“有些我們村子的男人 他們也出去接受教育了 為什麼他們不回來建立一所男子學校？ 而我來建立一所女子學校?” 這個說法很合理。最後他們都同意了"}, {"zh-tw": " And I told them, I wanted them to show me a sign of commitment. And they did. They donated land where we built the girls' school.", "en": " 我跟他們說，我希望他們可以對他們的承擔有所表示 然後，他們便捐出了一塊地讓我們建立一所女子學校"}, {"zh-tw": " We have.
