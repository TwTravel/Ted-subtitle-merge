Later that year, he took it outfor the first public test drive, and -- true story --crashed into a wall. For the last 130 years, we've been working around that leastreliable part of the car, the driver.", "en": " 1885年，卡爾·賓士發明汽車。 那年底，他開著那台車做了第一次公開試駕， 結果，撞毀了。 過去 130 年來， 我們一直致力於改進車裡最不可靠的部分，駕駛。"}, {"zh-tw": " We've made the car stronger. We've added seat belts,we've added air bags, and in the last decade, we've actuallystarted trying to make the car smarter to fix that bug, the driver.", "en": " 我們讓車子更堅固。 我們加上安全帶和安全氣囊， 過去十年，我們想辦法讓車子變得更聰明 來修正駕駛這個問題。"}, {"zh-tw": " Now, today I'm going to talk to youa little bit about the difference between patching around the problemwith driver assistance systems and actually having fullyself-driving cars and what they can do for the world. I'm also going to talk to youa little bit about our car and allow you to see how it sees the worldand how it reacts and what it does, but first I'm going to talka little bit about the problem.", "en": " 現在，我要告訴你 使用駕駛輔助系統來修正這問題， 和完全自動化駕駛其中的差異 以及在世界上所產生的影響。 我也將告訴你關於我們車子的一些細節 讓你可以了解它所看到的世界以及如何對外界做出反應， 首先我先來探討一個問題。"}, {"zh-tw": " And it's a big problem: 1.2 million people are killedon the world's roads every year. In America alone, 33,000 peopleare killed each year.", "en": " 是一個大問題： 全世界每年有 120 萬人死於交通事故。 僅僅美國，每年就佔了 33,000 人。"}, {"zh-tw": " To put that in perspective, that's the same as a 737falling out of the sky every working day. It's kind of unbelievable.", "en": " 依此數據與飛機事故比較， 等於每個上班日，都有一台 737 從空中掉下。 有點讓人無法置信。"}, {"zh-tw": " Cars are sold to us like this, but really, this is what driving's like. Right? It's not sunny, it's rainy, and you want to do anythingother than drive.", "en": " 車輛以這種模式賣給我們， 但實際上，這才是我們開車所遇到的狀況， 對吧？不是晴天，而是雨天， 除了開車外你還想要做其他事。"}, {"zh-tw": " And the reason why is this: Traffic is getting worse. In America, between 1990 and 2010, the vehicle miles traveledincreased by 38 percent.", "en": " 就是這個原因： 交通變得更糟糕了。 在美國，1990 年到 2010 年間， 汽車行駛哩程數增加百分之三十八，"}, {"zh-tw": " We grew by six percent of roads, so it's not in your brains. Traffic really is substantially worsethan it was not very long ago.", "en": " 但是道路只增加百分之六， 所以不是錯覺。 跟幾年前比起來交通其實是變差。"}, {"zh-tw": " And all of this has a very human cost. So if you take the average commute timein America, which is about 50 minutes, you multiply that by the 120 millionworkers we have, that turns out to beabout six billion minutes wasted in commuting every day.", "en": " 所有這一切都代表大量的人力成本。 以美國平均通勤時間來看，大約 50 分鐘， 乘以目前約一億兩千萬工作人口， 將會是六十億分鐘的時間 浪費在每天的通勤上。"}, {"zh-tw": " Now, that's a big number,so let's put it in perspective.

We should do something about that.", "en": " 他無法像你我一樣有到處走動的自由。 我們應該做一些事情。"}, {"zh-tw": " Now, conventional wisdom would say that we'll just takethese driver assistance systems and we'll kind of push themand incrementally improve them, and over time, they'll turninto self-driving cars.

And so I'm going to talk to youabout three different ways that self-driving systems are differentthan driver assistance systems.", "en": " 我們確實需要用一些不同的方式去做事情。 我將告訴你在自動駕駛系統 與駕駛輔助系統之間，有三個不同點。"}, {"zh-tw": " And I'm going to startwith some of our own experience. So back in 2013, we had the first testof a self-driving car where we let regular people use it.", "en": " 從我們本身的經驗開始談起。 2013 年。 我們第一次做自動駕駛車的測試 我們讓一般大眾人去開它。"}, {"zh-tw": " Well, almost regular --they were 100 Googlers, but they weren't working on the project. And we gave them the car and we allowedthem to use it in their daily lives.", "en": " 嗯，幾乎算是 -- 他們是 100 位谷歌的員工， 但他們的工作都不屬於這個專案， 我們提供車輛並允許在每天的日常生活中使用。"}, {"zh-tw": " But unlike a real self-driving car,this one had a big asterisk with it: They had to pay attention, because this was an experimental vehicle. We tested it a lot,but it could still fail.", "en": " 但這不像是自動駕駛的車，上頭有一個大大的星號在車上， 他們必須集中注意力開車， 因為這些只是實驗車輛。 我們測試很多，但仍有失敗狀況發生。"}, {"zh-tw": " And so we gave them two hours of training, we put them in the car,we let them use it, and what we heard backwas something awesome, as someone tryingto bring a product into the world. Every one of them told us they loved it.", "en": " 所以我們給車主 2 個小時的訓練， 再讓他們進入車內使用它， 我們所收到的回覆讓人感到驚訝， 當一個新產品嘗試進入這個世界。 每一個人都跟我們說他們愛上了它。"}, {"zh-tw": " In fact, we had a Porsche driverwho came in and told us on the first day, \"This is completely stupid.What are we thinking?\" But at the end of it, he said,\"Not only should I have it, everyone else should have it,because people are terrible drivers.\" So this was music to our ears, but then we started to look at whatthe people inside the car were doing, and this was eye-opening. Now, my favorite story is this gentleman who looks down at his phoneand realizes the battery is low, so he turns around like this in the carand digs around in his backpack, pulls out his laptop, puts it on the seat, goes in the back again, digs around, pulls outthe charging cable for his phone, futzes around, puts it into the laptop,puts it on the phone.", "en": " 事實上，第一天有一個開保時捷的駕駛跟我們說， 「這完全是件愚蠢的事情，不知道我們在想些什麼？」 但是在他測試結束後，他說「不該只有我可以使用它， 每個人都該使用它，因為許多人都是個糟糕的駕駛。」 這對我們來說有很大的鼓勵， 然後我們開始研究人們在車裡做些什麼， 真讓人大開眼界。 我最喜歡的故事裡有一位男士 他低頭看手機發現電池快沒電了， 然後在車裡像這樣轉過身來，並且在背包裡找尋東西， 拿出一台筆記型電腦， 放在前座， 再回頭一次， 繼續搜尋，拿出手機的充電線， 轉身回來，把電源線接上筆電跟手機。"}, {"zh-tw": " Sure enough, the phone is charging. All the time he's been doing65 miles per hour down the freeway.", "en": " 當然他的手機已經開始充電了。 同時他以 65 英哩的速度在高速公路上行駛。"}, {"zh-tw": " Right? Unbelievable. So we thought about this and we said,it's kind of obvious, right? The better the technology gets, the less reliablethe driver is going to get.", "en": " 讓人無法置信。 我們思考這整件事情，有明顯的結論 有更好的科技輔助， 駕駛就越不可靠。"}, {"zh-tw": " So by just making the carsincrementally smarter, we're probably not going to seethe wins we really need. Let me talk about somethinga little technical for a moment here.", "en": " 若只讓車子變得更聰明， 那就和我們希望達到的結果不同。 讓我來談論有關技術的部分。"}, {"zh-tw": " So we're looking at this graph,and along the bottom is how often does the carapply the brakes when it shouldn't. You can ignore most of that axis, because if you're driving around town,and the car starts stopping randomly, you're never going to buy that car.", "en": " 我們來看這圖型，底部的部分， 是在不該踩煞車的情況下卻踩煞車的頻率， 你可以忽略大部分的 X 軸， 因為如果在你開車到鎮上的路程中，隨時煞車的話， 你將不會買這部車。"}, {"zh-tw": " And the vertical axis is how oftenthe car is going to apply the brakes when it's supposed toto help you avoid an accident. Now, if we look atthe bottom left corner here, this is your classic car.", "en": " 從垂直軸上可以看到當車輛踩煞車後 可以幫助你避免意外的頻率。 現在，我們看到左下角這個點， 這是我們一般的車輛。"}, {"zh-tw": " It doesn't apply the brakes for you,it doesn't do anything goofy, but it also doesn't get youout of an accident. Now, if we want to bringa driver assistance system into a car, say with collision mitigation braking, we're going to put some packageof technology on there, and that's this curve, and it's goingto have some operating properties, but it's never going to avoidall of the accidents, because it doesn't have that capability.", "en": " 他不會幫忙煞車傻傻的也不會幫忙任何事， 當然也無法幫你避免意外。 現在，如果我們想要引進駕駛輔助系統， 如碰撞減輕煞車系統。 我們將在這上面導入一些技術方案， 由這個曲線得知，這系統可以發揮一些功效， 但仍不可能避免所有的意外， 因為尚未有足夠的能力。"}, {"zh-tw": " But we'll pick some placealong the curve here, and maybe it avoids half of accidentsthat the human driver misses, and that's amazing, right? We just reduced accidents on our roadsby a factor of two. There are now 17,000 less peopledying every year in America.", "en": " 但我們可以在這個曲線中挑一點， 它也許就足夠避免掉一半人為疏失所造成的意外， 非常神奇，對吧？ 我們改變一、兩個因素就可以把路上的意外事故減少一半。 在美國每年有接近 一萬七千人死於交通事故。"}, {"zh-tw": " But if we want a self-driving car, we need a technology curvethat looks like this. We're going to have to putmore sensors in the vehicle, and we'll pick someoperating point up here where it basically nevergets into a crash.", "en": " 但如果我們想要有自動駕駛車輛， 我們需要像這條的技術曲線。 需要將更多的感測器放在車上， 將功能調整在曲線上這一點 基本上這點不會導致車禍發生。"}, {"zh-tw": " They'll happen, but very low frequency. Now you and I could look at thisand we could argue about whether it's incremental, andI could say something like \"80-20 rule,\" and it's really hard to move upto that new curve.", "en": " 就算是有，也是個很低的機率。 當然你可以跟我辯論這一部分 曲線是否有增量性，我只能說有些事情就像「80-20 法則」， 向上移動成為一個新的曲線是非常困難的。"}, {"zh-tw": " But let's look at itfrom a different direction for a moment. So let's look at how oftenthe technology has to do the right thing.", "en": " 我們暫時由另一個方向來看這件事。 可以發現科技做正出確的判斷有多高。"}, {"zh-tw": " And so this green dot up hereis a driver assistance system. It turns out that human drivers make mistakes that leadto traffic accidents about once every 100,000 miles in America.", "en": " 這條綠線代表的是駕駛輔助系統。 結果說明了一般駕駛 的錯誤行為而導致意外發生 在美國約每十萬英哩發生一次。"}, {"zh-tw": " In contrast, a self-driving systemis probably making decisions about 10 times per second, so order of magnitude, that's about 1,000 times per mile. So if you compare the distancebetween these two, it's about 10 to the eighth, right? Eight orders of magnitude.", "en": " 相對的，自動駕駛系統做出決定 每秒大約 10 次， 在這個數量級， 大約每英哩 1,000 次。 所以如果你比較這兩個的距離， 大約是 10 的 8 次方，對吧？ 8 次方的數量級。"}, {"zh-tw": " That's like comparing how fast I run to the speed of light. It doesn't matter how hard I train,I'm never actually going to get there.", "en": " 這個對比有點像是以我跑步的速度 與光速作比較。 所以不管我如何努力訓練，都不可能實際達到那個程度。"}, {"zh-tw": " So there's a pretty big gap there. And then finally, there's howthe system can handle uncertainty.", "en": " 他們之間有一個很大的差距。 最後的部分，這個系統可以處理一些突發狀況。"}, {"zh-tw": " So this pedestrian here might bestepping into the road, might not be. I can't tell,nor can any of our algorithms, but in the case ofa driver assistance system, that means it can't take action,because again, if it presses the brakes unexpectedly,that's completely unacceptable.", "en": " 這個人有可能是走在馬路上，也有可能不是。 我不能預測，我們的演算法也無法預測， 但是駕駛輔助系統在這情況下， 無法採取任何行動， 如果無預期的踩煞車是完全無法被接受的。"}, {"zh-tw": " Whereas a self-driving systemcan look at that pedestrian and say, I don't know what they're about to do, slow down, take a better look,and then react appropriately after that. So it can be much safer thana driver assistance system can ever be.", "en": " 當自動駕駛系統發現這位行人會說， 我不知道他們打算做什麼， 減慢速度，仔細觀察，之後再採取更適當的回應。 比起駕駛輔助系統它將會更為安全。"}, {"zh-tw": " So that's enough aboutthe differences between the two. Let's spend some time talking abouthow the car sees the world.", "en": " 這是兩個不同系統之間的差別。 我們花點時間來探討車輛所看到的世界。"}, {"zh-tw": " So this is our vehicle. It starts by understandingwhere it is in the world, by taking a map and its sensor dataand aligning the two, and then we layer on top of thatwhat it sees in the moment.", "en": " 這是我們的測試車。 從理解目前所在的位置開始， 比對地圖與感應到的訊息， 然後把當下所看到的訊息再加上另一訊息。"}, {"zh-tw": " So here, all the purple boxes you can seeare other vehicles on the road, and the red thing on the sideover there is a cyclist, and up in the distance,if you look really closely, you can see some cones. Then we know where the caris in the moment, but we have to do better than that:we have to predict what's going to happen.", "en": " 在裏頭，你所看到的所有紫色方框都是路上的其他車輛， 旁邊的紅色部分則是自行車， 如果你仔細看上方較遠處， 可以看到一些三角錐。 然後就可以知道車輛當時的位置， 但是我們需要做得更好：要能夠預測出將會發生的事情，"}, {"zh-tw": " So here the pickup truck in top rightis about to make a left lane change because the road in front of it is closed, so it needs to get out of the way. Knowing that one pickup truck is great, but we really need to knowwhat everybody's thinking, so it becomes quite a complicated problem.", "en": " 右上角有一輛小貨卡將會切換到左邊車道 因為前方的路段將會關閉， 所以需要變更車道 可以預測小貨車的行徑是件很棒的事， 但我們還需要知道每個人的想法， 這變成一個非常複雜的問題。"}, {"zh-tw": " And then given that, we can figure outhow the car should respond in the moment, so what trajectory it should follow, howquickly it should slow down or speed up. And then that all turns intojust following a path: turning the steering wheel left or right,pressing the brake or gas.", "en": " 有了這資訊後，我們便可以推測出當下車輛該如何反應。 該跟隨哪一條路線，該多快反應減速或加速。 匯集所有項目後只要跟隨著路線， 向左或向右轉動方向盤，加速或踩油門。"}, {"zh-tw": " It's really just two numbersat the end of the day. So how hard can it really be? Back when we started in 2009, this is what our system looked like.", "en": " 只要這兩個數值就可以持續到一天結束。 所以會有多難呢？ 在 2009 年我們剛開始時， 我的系統看起來像這樣。"}, {"zh-tw": " So you can see our car in the middleand the other boxes on the road, driving down the highway. The car needs to understand where it isand roughly where the other vehicles are.", "en": " 你可以看到在中心有我們的車輛，路上還有其他小方框， 行駛在高速公路上。 這輛測試車需要知道它現在位置以及其他車輛大約位置。"}, {"zh-tw": " It's really a geometricunderstanding of the world. Once we started drivingon neighborhood and city streets, the problem becomes a wholenew level of difficulty.", "en": " 用幾何方式來理解這個世界。 當開始行駛在近郊及街道中時， 這問題又變為更複雜的層次。"}, {"zh-tw": " You see pedestrians crossing in frontof us, cars crossing in front of us, going every which way, the traffic lights, crosswalks. It's an incredibly complicatedproblem by comparison.", "en": " 可以看到行人及車輛都會在我們前面穿過， 往各個方向移動， 紅綠燈，行人穿越道。 相對而言這是個相當複雜的問題。"}, {"zh-tw": " And then once you havethat problem solved, the vehicle has to be ableto deal with construction. So here are the cones on the leftforcing it to drive to the right, but not just constructionin isolation, of course.", "en": " 一旦這問題可以被解決掉， 車輛就有辦法去處理這建構出來的環境。 如果左邊有三角錐它就會要求往右邊開， 當然不只是個封閉的施工環境。"}, {"zh-tw": " It has to deal with other people movingthrough that construction zone as well. And of course, if anyone'sbreaking the rules, the police are there and the car has to understand thatthat flashing light on the top of the car means that it's not just a car,it's actually a police officer.", "en": " 它也還必須去處理有人走在施工區的路段。 當然，如果有人違規，警察在場 車輛必須知道車頂上有閃著燈的車輛 代表的是警車而不是一般車輛。"}, {"zh-tw": " Similarly, the orange boxon the side here, it's a school bus, and we have to treat thatdifferently as well. When we're out on the road,other people have expectations: So, when a cyclist puts up their arm, it means they're expecting the carto yield to them and make room for them to make a lane change.", "en": " 相似的情況下，在路旁的橘色小方框， 是一輛校車， 我們也必需對它做出不同的回應。 當車輛在行駛的時候，有些人會預期， 當自行車騎士舉起他們的手臂， 是預期汽車可以注意到他們並且挪出空間 讓他們可以變換車道。"}, {"zh-tw": " And when a police officerstood in the road, our vehicle should understandthat this means stop, and when they signal to go,we should continue. Now, the way we accomplish thisis by sharing data between the vehicles.", "en": " 當一位警察站在路上， 測試車輛必須了解要停下來， 如果手勢指揮通行的話，則要繼續走。 經由交通工具資料共享我們完成這個成就。"}, {"zh-tw": " The first, most crude model of this is when one vehiclesees a construction zone, having another know about itso it can be in the correct lane to avoid some of the difficulty. But we actually have a muchdeeper understanding of this.", "en": " 首先，最原始的模型 當車輛遇到施工區域， 讓其他人收到這個訊息然後它會選擇正確的車道 而避開施工的地方。 但我們對這狀況有更進一步的了解。"}, {"zh-tw": " We could take all of the datathat the cars have seen over time, the hundreds of thousandsof pedestrians, cyclists, and vehicles that have been out there and understand what they look like and use that to inferwhat other vehicles should look like and other pedestrians should look like. And then, even more importantly,we could take from that a model of how we expect themto move through the world.", "en": " 取得車子所看到的歷史資料， 數十萬的行人，自行車， 以及視線內的車輛 理解他們看起來像什麼 再用來推斷其他車輛的樣式 及其他行人的長相。 最重要的是，我們會依此作為模型 以及預測他們是如何移動，"}, {"zh-tw": " So here the yellow box is a pedestriancrossing in front of us. Here the blue box is a cyclistand we anticipate that they're going to nudge outand around the car to the right.", "en": " 黃色方框指的是一位行人從我們面前穿越。 藍色方框指的是自行車而且我們預測 他們將會沿著車輛的右邊前行。。"}, {"zh-tw": " Here there's a cyclistcoming down the road and we know they're going to continueto drive down the shape of the road. Here somebody makes a right turn, and in a moment here, somebody'sgoing to make a U-turn in front of us, and we can anticipate that behaviorand respond safely.", "en": " 這是另一輛自行車從對向而來 而且我們知道他會沿著道路過來。 另外有一個人要右轉， 同時正前方有一個人正準備要迴轉， 我們可以預測這個行為並安全的反應。"}, {"zh-tw": " Now, that's all well and goodfor things that we've seen, but of course, you encounterlots of things that you haven't seen in the world before. And so just a couple of months ago, our vehicles were drivingthrough Mountain View, and this is what we encountered.", "en": " 這些是我們一般常見的好的狀況， 當然有時也會遇到一些事情 是之前從不曾遇到過。 幾個月前， 測試車輛行經山景城時， 我們遇到一個狀況。"}, {"zh-tw": " This is a woman in an electric wheelchair chasing a duck in circles on the road. Now it turns out, there is nowherein the DMV handbook that tells you how to deal with that, but our vehicles were ableto encounter that, slow down, and drive safely.", "en": " 一位坐著電動輪椅的女人 在路上追逐著繞圈圈鴨子。 在加州管理局中的駕駛手冊中找不到任何說明 告訴你如何處理以上狀況， 但是我們測試車輛有辦法處理它。 減速，安全地行駛而過。"}, {"zh-tw": " Now, we don't have to dealwith just ducks. Watch this bird fly across in front of us.The car reacts to that.", "en": " 我們不只是要對付鴨子。 看到一隻鳥在前方飛越而過車子也對它們做出反應。"}, {"zh-tw": " Here we're dealing with a cyclist that you would never expect to seeanywhere other than Mountain View. And of course, we haveto deal with drivers, even the very small ones.", "en": " 這裡我們正在應付一位自行車騎士 除了在山景城外你從來無法預期會遇到的。 當然，我們還得應付一些駕駛， 甚至是很小事也要處理。"}, {"zh-tw": " Watch to the right as someonejumps out of this truck at us. And now, watch the left as the carwith the green box decides he needs to make a right turnat the last possible moment.", "en": " 注意右邊有一個人在我們面前從卡車上跳下來。 左邊有綠色方框所代表的車輛 在最後一個的關頭決定右轉。"}, {"zh-tw": " Here, as we make a lane change,the car to our left decides it wants to as well. And here, we watch a carblow through a red light and yield to it.", "en": " 當我們決定要變換車道時，左邊的車輛 也決定要變換車道。 這邊我們看到一輛車子闖紅燈 就讓他先過。"}, {"zh-tw": " And similarly, here, a cyclistblowing through that light as well. And of course,the vehicle responds safely.", "en": " 相同的情況，則是另一輛自行車闖紅燈。 當然測試車輛可以安全地回應。"}, {"zh-tw": " And of course, we have peoplewho do I don't know what sometimes on the road, like this guypulling out between two self-driving cars. You have to ask, \"What are you thinking?\" Now, I just fire-hosed youwith a lot of stuff there, so I'm going to break one of thesedown pretty quickly.", "en": " 有時候人們會在路上做一些無法理解的事 就像這位仁兄一樣，直接把車輛停在兩輛自動駕駛車之間。 你就會很想問，「你在想些什麼？」 我剛才描述了許多狀況給大家， 我將用很快的方式來分析其中一個狀況。"}, {"zh-tw": " So what we're looking at is the scenewith the cyclist again, and you might notice in the bottom,we can't actually see the cyclist yet, but the car can: it's that littleblue box up there, and that comes from the laser data.

No, that's exactly right,and it's not to say that the driver assistance systemsaren't going to be incredibly valuable. They can save a lot of livesin the interim, but to see the transformative opportunityto help someone like Steve get around, to really get to the end case in safety, to have the opportunityto change our cities and move parking out and get rid ofthese urban craters we call parking lots, it's the only way to go.", "en": " 克里斯·厄姆森： 完全正確，現在還無法說 駕駛輔助系統不具有價值。 在這段過渡期間它們仍可挽救許多生命， 但是看到這是一個改變的機會，可以幫助像史蒂夫一樣的人， 而且最終是個安全的方案， 去擁有這機會去改變我們的城市 可以擺脫城市裡一個個的停車場， 這是唯一的辦法。"}, {"zh-tw": " CA: We will be tracking your progresswith huge interest.
