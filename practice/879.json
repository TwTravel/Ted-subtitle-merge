With independence, the whole approach of community getting involved was embraced by our new government.", "en": " 因此, 當人們開始感覺對於野生動物有所有權 野生動物的數量開始回升 這也成為了納米比亞保育的基礎 因為獨立, 社區這個整合的概念 被新的政府欣然的接受"}, {"zh-tw": " Three things that actually help to build on this foundation: The very first one is honoring of tradition and being open to new ideas.

Transporting rhinos using helicopters I think is much easier than talking through a spirit that you can't see, isn't it? And these things we were taught by outsiders.", "en": " 再來談談新的想法 用直升機運送犀牛 我想是比跟一個你看不見的神靈 說話來的容易, 是不是? 這些事情是由外來者教給我們的"}, {"zh-tw": " We learned these things from outsiders. We needed new boundaries to describe our traditional lands; we needed to learn more things like GPS just to see whether -- can GPS really reflect the true reflection of the land or is this just a thing made somewhere in the West? And we then wanted to see whether we can match our ancestral maps with digital maps made somewhere in the world.", "en": " 我們從他們的身上學到這些東西 我們需要新的界線去描述我們的傳統地景; 我們需要去學習像GPS這樣的東西 只是想要知道 GPS是不是真的可以反應真實的地景 或它只是由西方世界發明的一個東西? 接著想要看看我們是否可以比照 祖先流傳下來的地圖與發明於世界某處的電子地圖"}, {"zh-tw": " And through this, we actually started realizing our dreams, and we maintained honoring our traditions but we were still open to new ideas. The second element is that we wanted to have a life, a better life where we can benefit through many things.", "en": " 透過這些. 我們開始實現我們的夢想 而且我們榮耀了我們的傳統 但我們仍然接納新的想法 第二個元素存在的原因是因為我們想要一種生活, 一種可以從各個方面受惠的較好的生活"}, {"zh-tw": " Most poachers, like my father, were people from our own community. They were not people from outside.", "en": " 大部份的盜獵者, 像我的父親, 是從我們自己社區中出來的 他們不是外來者"}, {"zh-tw": " These were our own people. And sometimes, once they were caught, they were treated with respect, brought back into the communities and they were made part of the bigger dreams.", "en": " 這些是我們自己的人民 有時候, 一但他們被逮捕, 他們會被有尊嚴的對待, 並且被帶回社區裡 而他們會被成為這個遠大的夢想的一部份"}, {"zh-tw": " The best one, like my father -- I'm not campaigning for my father -- they were put in charge to stop others from poaching. And when this thing started going on, we started becoming one community, renewing our connection to nature.", "en": " 最厲害的人, 像我父親 -- 我不是在為我父親競選拉票 -- (笑） 他們會被任命為阻止盜獵行為的負責人 所以當這樣的事情開始發生, 我們開始變成一個社群; 我們知道我們和自然的關係"}, {"zh-tw": " And that was a very strong thing in Namibia. The last element that actually helped develop these things was the partnerships.", "en": " 而那是在納米比亞的一個非常非常重要的事情 幫忙這整件事情發展的最後一個元素 是一個合夥的關係"}, {"zh-tw": " Our government has given legal status over our traditional lands. The other partners that we have got is business communities.", "en": " 政府在我們流傳下來的土地上，給與合法擁有的權利 我們的另一些合夥人 是商業社群"}, {"zh-tw": " Business communities helped bring Namibia onto the world map and they have also helped make wildlife a very valuable land use like any other land uses such as agriculture. And most of my conservation colleagues today that you find in Namibia have been trained through the initiative, through the involvement of World Wildlife Fund in the most up-to-date conservation practices.", "en": " 商業社群幫助帶領納米比亞走上世界地圖 他們也幫助使野生生物的生長 成為非常有價值的一種土地使用方式, 就像是任何一種土地使用 例如農業 現在我大部份在納米比亞 從事保育工作的同事 被主動積極的機構所培訓 透過世界自然基金會的參與 使用最新的實行作法"}, {"zh-tw": " They have also given funding for two decades to this whole program. And so far, with the support of World Wildlife Fund, we've been able to scale up the very small programs to national programs today.", "en": " 這二十年來他們也一直 給與整個計畫資金 目前,因為世界自然基金會的支持 我們有能力把非常小的計畫擴大 到全國性的計畫"}, {"zh-tw": " Namibia ... or Sesfontein was no more an isolated village somewhere, hidden away in Namibia. With these assets we are now part of the global village.", "en": " 納米比亞 ... 或是Sesfontein 已經不在是藏在納米比亞某處的 孤立村莊 因為這些資產, 我們現在是整個地球村的一部份"}, {"zh-tw": " Thirty years have passed since my father's first job as a community game guard. It's very unfortunate that he passed away and he cannot see the success as I and my children see it today.", "en": " 三十年過去了 從我父親的第一份工作- 社區狩獵管理員, 開始算起 不幸的是我已經父親過世了, 他沒有機會目睹這份成就 如同我和我的孩子現在看到的景況"}, {"zh-tw": " When I finished school in 1995, there were only 20 lions in the entire Northwest -- in our area.

Conservancies are legally instituted institutions by the government, and these are run by the communities themselves, for their benefit.", "en": " 而且, 從非常小的起點, 社區巡邏員開始使社區參與 現在演變成名為保護局的機構 保護局是合法創制的機構 為政府所擁有 而這些機構為社區所自行運作, 為著他們自己的福利"}, {"zh-tw": " Today, we have got 60 conservancies that manage and protect over 13 million hectares of land in Namibia.

I like that one: Namibia serving as a model to Africa, and Africa serving as a model to the United States.", "en": " 現在, 這個世界真正需要的 是需要你和我們的合夥人 把在納米比亞學到的經驗帶到 其他面臨類似情形的的地方 像是蒙古, 或是你們自家的後院, 北部大草原, 水牛和其他動物正面臨危機 許多社區人數正在下降 我喜歡這點 納米比亞成為非洲的典範 然後非洲再作為美國的典範"}, {"zh-tw": " We were successful in Namibia because we dreamed of a future that was much more than just a healthy wildlife.
