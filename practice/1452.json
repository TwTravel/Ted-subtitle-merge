Forty-two million people were displaced by natural disasters in 2010. Now, there was nothing particularly special about 2010, because, on average, 31 and a half million people are displaced by natural disasters every single year.", "en": " 我要以一個掃興的事實來開講 4200 萬人 在 2010 年發生的自然災害中流離失所 但 2010 年並沒有特別倒楣 因為每年平均有 3150 萬人 在自然災害中流離失所"}, {"zh-tw": " Now, usually when people hear statistics or stats like that, you start thinking about places like Haiti or other kind of exotic or maybe even impoverished areas, but it happens right here in the United States every single year. Last year alone, 99 federally declared disasters were on file with FEMA, from Joplin, Missouri, and Tuscaloosa, Alabama, to the Central Texas wildfires that just happened recently.", "en": " 人們聽到這樣的統計資料 通常會想到像海地這樣的外國 或者是更遙遠、更貧困的地區 然而這卻是每年發生在美國境內的數量 僅去年一年，聯邦應急管理署 (FEMA) 認定 並登記在案的天災有 99 件 從密蘇里州的喬普林阿拉巴馬州的塔斯卡羅薩的龍捲風 到最近發生在德州中部的野火"}, {"zh-tw": " Now, how does the most powerful country in the world handle these displaced people? They cram them onto cots, put all your personal belongings in a plastic garbage bag, stick it underneath, and put you on the floor of an entire sports arena, or a gymnasium. So obviously there's a massive housing gap, and this really upset me, because academia tells you after a major disaster, there's typically about an 18-month time frame to -- we kinda recover, start the recovery process, but what most people don't realize is that on average it takes 45 to 60 days or more for the infamous FEMA trailers to even begin to show up.", "en": " 這個全世界最強勢的國家 又是怎樣安置災民的呢？ 他們讓災民塞在簡易窄床上，把你所有的東西 裝進一個塑膠垃圾袋，塞在床下 然後讓你住在體育場 或者體育館的地板上 顯然，這是一個很大的居住匱乏問題 這讓我非常痛心，因為學術界告訴我們 在重大災害發生後，一般來說 大概經過 18 個月後，我們才開始恢復 開始重建過程 但大多數人都不知道 惡名昭彰的聯邦應急管理署平均要花 45 到 60 天或更多的時間，才會派拖車到現場"}, {"zh-tw": " Before that time, people are left to their own devices. So I became obsessed with trying to figure out a way to actually fill this gap.", "en": " 在這之前，災民只能自己想辦法 因此我沉迷於找出一個好辦法 來填補這個缺口"}, {"zh-tw": " This actually became my creative obsession. I put aside all my freelance work after hours and started just focusing particularly on this problem.", "en": " 這件事讓我成為了創意狂熱者 我推掉了所有的兼職工作 開始專心研究這個問題"}, {"zh-tw": " So I started sketching. Two days after Katrina, I started sketching and sketching and trying to brainstorm up ideas or solutions for this, and as things started to congeal or ideas started to form, I started sketching digitally on the computer, but it was an obsession, so I couldn't just stop there.", "en": " 我開始畫草圖 在卡崔娜颶風發生的兩天後，我開始整日畫著草圖 試著腦力激盪出解決方案 當想法開始成形 我開始用電腦來繪圖 我沉迷其中，無法就此停手"}, {"zh-tw": " I started experimenting, making models, talking to experts in the field, taking their feedback, and refining, and I kept on refining and refining for nights and weekends for over five years. Now, my obsession ended up driving me to create full-size prototypes in my own backyard —  — and actually spending my own personal savings on everything from tooling to patents and a variety of other costs, but in the end I ended up with this modular housing system that can react to any situation or disaster.", "en": " 我開始做實驗、做模型 諮詢這個領域的專家，接受他們的反饋意見 去蕪存菁，不斷改善 利用晚上和週末的時間，研究了五年多 最終，我的狂熱導致 我在自家後院裡製造了等比例的樣品模型 花的是我自己的儲蓄 來購買工具、申請專利 以及負擔其他的各種成本 最終我完成了這個組合式的房屋系統 可以對任何情形或災害做出緊急應變"}, {"zh-tw": " It can be put up in any environment, from an asphalt parking lot to pastures or fields, because it doesn't require any special setup or specialty tools. Now, at the foundation and kind of the core of this whole system is the Exo Housing Unit, which is just the individual shelter module.", "en": " 它適用於任何環境 包括柏油路面的停車場，或是草地、田野 因為它無需任何特殊搭建 或者特殊工具 整個系統的基礎與核心 是 Exo 居住小屋 是獨立的避難模組"}, {"zh-tw": " And though it's light, light enough that you can actually lift it by hand and move it around, and it actually sleeps four people. And you can arrange these things as kind of more for encampments and more of a city grid type layout, or you can circle the wagons, essentially, and form these circular pods out of them, which give you this semi-private communal area for people to actually spill out into so they're not actually trapped inside these units.", "en": " 它的重量非常輕 可以徒手舉起、搬動 還能住進四個人 你可以將這些居住小屋 安排成營地或是市景街道的棋盤式格局 也可以圍成一圈 可以如圖所示排列 這樣就能形成一個半私密的公共區域 人們可以在這裡透透氣 而不必把自己關在小屋裡"}, {"zh-tw": " Now this fundamentally changes the way we respond to disasters, because gone are the horrid conditions inside a sports arena or a gymnasium, where people are crammed on these cots inside. Now we have instant neighborhoods outside.", "en": " 這個發明從根本上 改變了我們應對災害的方式 因為體育場館裡的 混亂狀況將不復存在 人們不再需要擠在那些簡易窄床上 我們在室外就有現成的社區"}, {"zh-tw": " So the Exo is designed to be simply, basically like a coffee cup. They can actually stack together so we get extremely efficient transportation and storage out of them. In fact, 15 Exos can fit on a single semi truck by itself.", "en": " Exo 小屋基本上被設計成 咖啡杯的樣子，能夠逐個疊起來 所以運輸和儲存 就變得效率非凡 事實上，1.5 輛卡車就可以裝下 15 個 Exo 小屋"}, {"zh-tw": " This means the Exo can actually be transported and set up faster than any other housing option available today. But I'm obsessive, so I couldn't just stop there, so I actually started modifying the bunks where you could actually slide out the bunks and slide in desks or shelving, so the same unit can now be used for an office or storage location.", "en": " 這就意味著運輸和組裝 Exo 小屋 比現有的任何一種組合屋都要快速 但是我已深陷其中，無法就此罷手 所以我開始調整床舖的位置 以便能把床鋪方便地替換成桌子和擱架 這樣一來同樣的小屋就能 作為辦公室或儲藏室了"}, {"zh-tw": " The doors can actually swap out, so you can actually put on a rigid panel with a window unit in it for climate control, or a connector module that would allow you to actually connect multiple units together, which gives you larger and kind of compartmentalized living spaces, so now this same kit of parts, this same unit can actually serve as a living room, bedroom or bathroom, or an office, a living space and secure storage. Sounds like a great idea, but how do you make it real? So the first idea I had, initially, was just to go the federal and state governments and go, \"Here, take it, for free.\" But I was quickly told that, \"Boy, our government doesn't really work like that.\" Okay. Okay. So maybe I would start a nonprofit to kind of help consult and get this idea going along with the government, but then I was told, \"Son, our government looks to private sector for things like this.\" Okay. So maybe I would take this whole idea and go to private corporations that would have this mutually shared benefit to it, but I was quickly told by some corporations that my personal passion project was not a brand fit because they didn't want their logos stamped across the ghettos of Haiti.", "en": " 門板也可以輕易拆卸 所以你可以換成有窗戶的硬板來配合天氣做變化 或者換成一種連接模組 讓你可以組合這些小屋 形成更大且可劃分的生活空間 如此一來，同樣的組件，同樣的小屋 可以作為客廳、臥房、浴室 或是辦公室可以是居住的空間和安全的倉庫 聽起來是很好的想法，但如何實現呢？ 我的第一個想法 就是去聯邦政府和州政府遊說 「免費拿去用吧！」 但很快我就被告知：「小夥子，我們的政府 可不能這樣辦事。」 好吧……我也許能設立一個非營利性組織 向政府推廣這個想法，提供諮詢服務 但我又被告知 「小夥子，我們的政府只會向私營部門 進行這種採購。」 好吧……也許我該把我的想法 分享給能夠創造雙贏局面的私營部門 但很快我就聽一些公司說 我個人的熱血計畫不符合他們的品牌訴求 因為他們不想讓自己的商標 遍佈海地的貧民區"}, {"zh-tw": " Now, I wasn't just obsessed. I was outraged. (Laughter.) So I decided, kind of told myself, \"Oh yeah? Watch this. I'll do it myself.\" Now, this quickly, my day job sent me to work out of our Milan office for a few months, so I was like, what will I do? So I actually scheduled sleep on my calendar, and spent the 8-hour time difference on conference calls with material suppliers, manufacturers and potential customers. And we found through this whole process, we found this great little manufacturer in Virginia, and if his body language is any indication, that's the owner —  — of what it's like for a manufacturer to work directly with a designer, you've got to see what happens here.", "en": " 這下我就不只是被迷惑了，我被激怒了！ 我暗自下定決心 「哦，是嗎？走著瞧吧，我自己來！」 不久之後，我的全職工作讓我 離開米蘭的辦公室工作幾個月 我問自己，能不能做點什麼？於是我在日曆列上睡眠的行程 然後利用 8 小時的時差進行電話會議 聯繫原料供應商、製造商和潛在客戶 經過這段努力的過程 我們找到了這家位在維吉尼亞州的優秀小廠商 從這個人的動作可以看出 他就是老闆 這就是建築商與設計師直接共事的情形 你們一定要看看這裡發生什麼事"}, {"zh-tw": " But G.S. Industries was fantastic. They actually built three prototypes for us by hand.", "en": " G.S 工業是一家了不起的企業 他們用手工做出了三個樣品模型"}, {"zh-tw": " So now we have prototypes that can show that four people can actually sleep securely and much more comfortably than a tent could ever provide. And they actually shipped them here to Texas for us.", "en": " 因此，我們現在擁有了展示模型 顯示小屋可以安全地容納四個人生活 這種生活也比以往住帳篷的方式要舒服得多 他們把模型運來德州"}, {"zh-tw": " Now, a funny thing started happening. Other people started to believe in what we were doing, and actually offered us hangar space, donated hangar space to us. And then the Georgetown Airport Authority was bent over backwards to help us with anything we needed.", "en": " 這時，一件有趣的事情發生了 別人開始相信我們所做的事 有人捐了一個停機棚給我們 喬治城機場管理局也不遺餘力地幫助我們 提供我們需要的一切"}, {"zh-tw": " So now we had a hangar space to work in, and prototypes to demo with. So in one year, we've negotiated manufacturing agreements, been awarded one patent, filed our second patent, talked to multiple people, demoed this to FEMA and its consultants to rave reviews, and then started talking to some other people who requested information, this little group called the United Nations.", "en": " 現在我們能在停機棚裡工作 也有展示模型 不出一年，我們談妥生產合約 獲得一項專利，申請了第二項專利 與各種各樣的人交流向聯邦應急管理署展示模型 該署的諮詢師（對模型）給予很高的評價 還把我們介紹給前來諮詢 稱為聯合國的小團體"}, {"zh-tw": " And on top of that, now we have a whole plethora of other individuals that have come up and started to talk to us from doing it for mining camps, mobile youth hostels, right down to the World Cup and the Olympics. So, in closing, on this whole thing here is hopefully very soon we will not have to respond to these painful phone calls that we get after disasters where we don't really have anything to sell or give you yet.", "en": " 除此之外 還有無數的個人找到我們談合作 包括採礦基地 流動的青年旅館，供給世界盃 和奧運會使用 總而言之，至今為止發生的一切 讓我們很可能不用再苦苦應付那些 災後充滿痛苦的來電 而拿不出任何可供銷售或捐贈的東西 來應對災難"}, {"zh-tw": " Hopefully very soon we will be there, because we are destined, obsessed with making it real. Thank you.", "en": " 我希望不久之後我們就能趕赴現場 因為我們註定 且狂熱地要讓夢想成真 謝謝大家"}], "title": "Michael Mcdaniel Cheap Effective Shelter For Disaster Relief"}
