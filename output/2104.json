But, we're absolutely clueless as to what this is or what it should be."}, {"zh-tw": "似乎在這個時代我們需要一場關於民主的對話讓我們這樣想:我們是 21 世紀公民嘗試和 19 世紀建立的體制互動這體制以15 世紀資訊科技 為運作基礎先來看一下", "en": "It seems like we need to have a conversation about democracy in our day and age. Let's think about it this way: We are 21st-century citizens, doing our very, very best to interact with 19th century-designedinstitutions that are based on an information technology of the 15th century."}, {"zh-tw": "這個體制的特色首先 這體制是為了五百多年前的資訊科技設計", "en": "Let's have a look at some of the characteristics of this system. First of all, it's designed for an information technology that's over 500 years old."}, {"zh-tw": "而這體制設計的可能最棒的地方在於第一少部分的人能夠以大眾之名做日常決策然後每隔幾年大家投一次票", "en": "And the best possible system that could be designed for it is one where the few make daily decisions in the name of the many. And the many get to vote once every couple of years."}, {"zh-tw": "第二 代價參與這體系的代價非常高你得要非常有錢和有影響力或投入畢生參與政治", "en": "In the second place, the costs of participating in this system are incredibly high. You either have to have a fair bit of money and influence, or you have to devote your entire life to politics."}, {"zh-tw": "你需成為一個黨員慢慢提升黨內地位直到或許某天 可以坐在桌邊參與政治決議最後也很重要的這體制的語言非常隱晦", "en": "You have to become a party member and slowly start working up the ranks until maybe, one day, you'll get to sit at a table where a decision is being made. And last but not least, the language of the system — it's incredibly cryptic."}, {"zh-tw": "由律師為了律師所定其他人難以理解所以，在這體制下我們可決定民意代表但我們完全無法得知他們如何做出決策", "en": "It's done for lawyers, by lawyers, and no one else can understand. So, it's a system where we can choose our authorities, but we are completely left out on howthose authorities reach their decisions."}, {"zh-tw": "也許某天因新的科技資訊我們可參與全球的任何一場對話我們幾乎可以得知所有的資訊也可比以前更積極表達我們的需求和擔憂我們的政治體系一成不變過去兩百年來皆如此還期待我們被動地聆聽單方政治決策需求就可被滿足", "en": "So, in a day where a new information technology allows us to participate globallyin any conversation, our barriers of information are completely lowered and we can, more than ever before, express our desires and our concerns. Our political system remains the same for the past 200 years and expects us to be contented with being simply passive recipients of a monologue."}, {"zh-tw": "所以一點也不意外這樣的體系下只會產生兩種結果沉默 或 爭論沉默表示市民置身事外簡單來說就是不想參與政治議題", "en": "So, it's really not surprising that this kind of system is only able to produce two kinds of results: silence or noise. Silence, in terms of citizens not engaging, simply not wanting to participate."}, {"zh-tw": "這是很普遍也是我很厭惡的想法也因此 我們對政治興致缺缺不願做任何承諾但可以怪我們嗎？怪我們錯失機會不願在工作日中跑到城市裡實際參與一場聽起來沒什麼影響的決策討論？衝突是體系中無法避免的但不代表溝通終止越來越多的市民站出來為自己發聲", "en": "There's this commonplace [idea] that I truly, truly dislike, and it's this idea that we citizens are naturally apathetic. That we shun commitment. But, can you really blame us for not jumping at the opportunity of going to the middle of the city in the middle of a working day to attend, physically, a public hearing that has no impact whatsoever? Conflict is bound to happen between a system that no longer represents, nor has any dialogue capacity, and citizens that are increasingly used to representing themselves."}, {"zh-tw": "這就是輿論智利 阿根廷 巴西 墨西哥義大利 法國 西班牙 美國都是民主國家即使有投票制度他們仍覺得需要佔據街頭才能表達心聲", "en": "And, then we find noise: Chile, Argentina, Brazil, MexicoItaly, France, Spain, the United States, they're all democracies. Their citizens have access to the ballot boxes. But they still feel the need, they need to take to the streets in order to be heard."}, {"zh-tw": "我覺得就像 18 世紀的那個口號那個口號促成了現代民主基礎無代表 不納稅現在是否應該改為無對話 無代表？我們應當要有桌邊席這毫無疑問", "en": "To me, it seems like the 18th-century slogan that was the basis for the formation of our modern democracies, \"No taxation without representation,\" can now be updated to \"No representationwithout a conversation.\" We want our seat at the table. And rightly so."}, {"zh-tw": "但若要參與對話我們需要知道下一步想做什麼因為政治行為已經能從煽動到團結我們這一代人已經善於利用網路和新科技組織抗議活動這些活動可以很成功地掀起議題撤回不當政策甚至推翻獨裁政府", "en": "But in order to be part of this conversation, we need to know what we want to do next, because political action is being able to move from agitation to construction. My generation has been incredibly good at using new networks and technologies to organize protests, protests that were able to successfully impose agendas, roll back extremely pernicious legislation, and even overthrow authoritarian governments."}, {"zh-tw": "我們應該為此感到非常驕傲但我們也得承認我們還沒有利用好網路和科技來詳述其他方案 解決現況並找到共識 凝聚力量讓想法實踐", "en": "And we should be immensely proud of this. But, we also must admit that we haven't been good at using those same networks and technologies to successfully articulate an alternativeto what we're seeing and find the consensus and build the alliances that are needed to make it happen."}, {"zh-tw": "此外我們還必須承擔的風險就是造成的權力真空讓某些有權勢力趁虛而入像是軍事或 虎視眈眈很久早已存在的極端組織然而 民主並不是每隔幾年投票一次", "en": "And so the risk that we face is that we can create these huge power vacuums that will very quickly get filled up by de facto powers, like the military or highly motivated and already organized groups that generally lie on the extremes. But our democracy is neither just a matter of voting once every couple of years."}, {"zh-tw": "也不是幾百萬人聚集在街頭所以在這我想問的一個很重要且需要有答案的問題若網路是新時代媒體那網路時代的民主是什麼我們想為 21 世紀建立怎樣的體系如果我沒有答案", "en": "But it's not either the ability to bring millionsonto the streets. So the question I'd like to raise here, and I do believe it's the most important question we need to answer, is this one: If Internet is the new printing press, then what is democracy for the Internet era? What institutions do we want to build for the 21st-century society? I don't have the answer, just in case."}, {"zh-tw": "我想也沒人知道但我們真的不能再漠視這個問題了", "en": "I don't think anyone does. But I truly believe we can't affordto ignore this question anymore."}, {"zh-tw": "所以，我想和大家分享我們的經驗以及從中學到的東西希望能藉此帶來一點啟發兩年前 我和一些阿根廷朋友想說該怎麼讓代表我們的民意代表\"代表\"我們馬素·麥克魯漢曾說政治是以昨日的工具解決今日的問題", "en": "So, I'd like to share our experience and what we've learned so far and hopefully contribute two cents to this conversation. Two years ago, with a group of friendsfrom Argentina, we started thinking, \"how can we get our representatives, our elected representatives, to represent us?\" Marshall McLuhan once said that politics is solving today's problems with yesterday's tools."}, {"zh-tw": "這句話讓我們不禁想到我們可否以每日用得到的工具解決今日的問題呢？我們的第一個方式是研究設計 DemocracyOS（民主操作系統）一套開放源代碼的網絡應用這套軟體設計用來作為市民和代表的溝通橋樑讓我們更方便地參與政治", "en": "So the question that motivated us was, can we try and solve some of today's problems with the tools that we use every singleday of our lives? Our first approach was to design and develop a piece of software called DemocracyOS. DemocracyOS is an open-source web application that is designed to become a bridge between citizens and their elected representatives to make it easier for us to participate from our everyday lives."}, {"zh-tw": "迅速掌握資訊我們可透過平台看到國會每天新提案的即時翻譯和顯而易懂的說明解釋但我們都知道知道更多的資訊並不能促使社會變遷而要掌握資訊並有所作為", "en": "So first of all, you can get informed so every new project that gets introduced in Congress gets immediately translated and explained in plain language on this platform. But we all know that social change is not going to come from just knowing more information, but from doing something with it."}, {"zh-tw": "因此 透過 DemocracyOS （民主操作系統）資訊的快速獲得可促使談話談論下一步可能的走向因為我們深信民主不只是疊加的結果並非喜好的堆疊健全的公眾辯論應該再次成為民主的基礎核心", "en": "So better access to information should lead to a conversation about what we're going to do next, and DemocracyOS allows for that. Because we believe that democracy is not just a matter of stacking up preferences, one on top of each other, but that our healthy and robust public debate should be, once again, one of its fundamental values."}, {"zh-tw": "DemocracyOS 是說服與被說服是達成共識以合適的方法解決分歧", "en": "So DemocracyOS is about persuading and being persuaded. It's about reaching a consensus as much as finding a proper way of channeling our disagreement."}, {"zh-tw": "最後 你可投票你希望你選出的代表如何投票若你對某個投票議題感到不自在你可委託別人代理投票也因此產生勤勉不懈的新社會領導", "en": "And finally, you can vote how you would like your elected representative to vote. And if you do not feel comfortable voting on a certain issue, you can always delegate your vote to someone else, allowing for a dynamic and emerging social leadership."}, {"zh-tw": "只要比對結果和民代在國會投票的情形一切都變得非常簡單但也很明顯的科技太過制式", "en": "It suddenly became very easy for us to simply compare these results with how our representatives were voting in Congress. But, it also became very evident that technology was not going to do the trick."}, {"zh-tw": "我們需要找到參與者讓他們利用大眾認知做出更好更公平的決定因此我們找來了傳統政黨提供他們 DemocracyOS", "en": "What we needed to do to was to find actors that were able to grab this distributed knowledge in society and use it to make betterand more fair decisions. So we reached out to traditional political parties and we offered them DemocracyOS."}, {"zh-tw": "我們跟他們說 透過此平台可建立和選民的雙方對話如你想的 我們失敗了徹底的失敗", "en": "We said, \"Look, here you have a platformthat you can use to build a two-way conversation with your constituencies.\" And yes, we failed. We failed big time."}, {"zh-tw": "我們像小孩一樣被叫閉嘴他們說我們無知 愚昧", "en": "We were sent to play outside like little kids. Amongst other things, we were called naive."}, {"zh-tw": "但老實說 事後回想 的確如此因為我們遇到的問題非技術性 而是文化層面", "en": "And I must be honest: I think, in hindsight, we were. Because the challenges that we face, they're not technological, they're cultural."}, {"zh-tw": "政黨不可能願意改變做決定的方式一切間答案很明顯若我們想進一步實現想法我們需靠自己實踐", "en": "Political parties were never willing to change the way they make their decisions. So it suddenly became a bit obvious that if we wanted to move forwardwith this idea, we needed to do it ourselves."}, {"zh-tw": "於是我們信心十足的去年八月 在阿根廷成立了自己的政黨網路黨 (El Partido de la Red)或 Net Party（網黨），在布宜諾斯艾利斯之後我們更自信無比的在去年十月出來競選我們秉持著：若我們想要國會席位我們的候選人和代表會依據市民在 DemocracyOs的決定來投票", "en": "And so we took quite a leap of faith, and in August last year, we founded our own political party, El Partido de la Red, or the Net Party, in the city of Buenos Aires. And taking an even bigger leap of faith, we ran for elections in October last year with this idea: if we want a seat in Congress, our candidate, our representatives were always going to vote according to what citizens decided on DemocracyOS."}, {"zh-tw": "即使是國會提出的單一法案我們也會根據市民在網路平台的決定投票這是我們顛覆政治體系的方法", "en": "Every single project that got introduced in Congress, we were going vote according to what citizens decidedon an online platform. It was our way of hacking the political system."}, {"zh-tw": "我們明瞭若想參與談話占國會一席我們須成為利益相關人要達到目標 唯遵守體系規則但我們悄悄入侵這個體系徹底改變政黨做決策的方法", "en": "We understood that if we wanted to become part of the conversation, to have a seat at the table, we needed to become valid stakeholders, and the only way of doing it is to play by the system rules. But we were hacking it in the sense that we were radically changing the way a political party makes its decisions."}, {"zh-tw": "第一次 我們總算可以做決定和那些與政策有直接影響的人一起做決定對於在阿根廷才成立兩個月的政黨這個舉動很大膽", "en": "For the first time, we were making our decisions together with those who we were affecting directly by those decisions. It was a very, very bold move for a two-month-old party in the city of Buenos Aires."}, {"zh-tw": "因此備受矚目我們獲得 22,000 票數佔總票數 1.2％在地方選舉排名第二", "en": "But it got attention. We got 22,000 votes, that's 1.2 percent of the votes, and we came in second for the local options."}, {"zh-tw": "雖然我們無法因此獲得國會席位卻讓我們可以參與對話接下來的那個月阿根廷史上第一次身為國家機構的國會推動 DemocracyOS 和 市民討論三個法案：兩個都市交通法案一個公共空間利用法案我們的民代並非表示「我們會根據選民的決定投票」但他們願意嘗試", "en": "So, even if that wasn't enough to win a seat in Congress, it was enough for us to become part of the conversation, to the extent that next month, Congress, as an institution, is launching for the first time in Argentina's history, a DemocracyOS to discuss, with the citizens, three pieces of legislation: two on urban transportation and one on the use of public space. Of course, our elected representatives are not saying, \"Yes, we're going to vote according to what citizens decide,\" but they're willing to try."}, {"zh-tw": "願意打開新局面讓選民加入談話希望他們也會願意好好傾聽選民我們可以改變政治系統但非以顛覆或破壞性手段而是利用網路工具改寫政治體系", "en": "They're willing to open up a new space for citizen engagement and hopefully they'll be willing to listen as well. Our political system can be transformed, and not by subverting it, by destroying it, but by rewiring it with the tools that Internet affords us now."}, {"zh-tw": "但最大的挑戰在於要找到 設計 創造方法以方法創新 讓喧囂和沉默被聽到最後將民主帶到 21 世紀我想這不容易", "en": "But a real challenge is to find, to design to create, to empower those connectors that are able to innovate, to transform noise and silence into signal and finally bring our democracies to the 21st century. I'm not saying it's easy."}, {"zh-tw": "但根據我們的經驗我們手握機會讓這個理想實現我打從心底深摯地覺得 值得一試", "en": "But in our experience, we actually stand a chance of making it work. And in my heart, it's most definitely worth trying."}, {"zh-tw": "謝謝大家", "en": "Thank you."}], "title": "Pia Mancini How To Upgrade Democracy For The Internet Era"}
