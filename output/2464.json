It is the most interestingpart in my office and I'm not actually using it anymore."}, {"zh-tw": "我想這兩件事其實相關。我的工作方式是──", "en": "And I think the two things are related. The way I work is ..."}, {"zh-tw": "我不想要有外界刺激。你們大概看得出來，牆面漆著淡綠色。", "en": "I want to not have external stimulation. You can kind of see,on the walls are this light green."}, {"zh-tw": "人家告訴我精神病院的牆壁都漆這種顏色。這是讓人平靜的顏色，這不是會刺激你的東西。", "en": "I'm told that at mental institutionsthey use that on the walls. It's like a calming color, it's not somethingthat really stimulates you."}, {"zh-tw": "你看不到的是那裡有臺電腦，你只能看到螢幕，但是我最擔心電腦的部分是──它不用很大很強，雖然這部分我也喜歡──但它真的必須完全靜音。我認識一些在 Google 工作的人，他們在家裡有自己的小型資料中心，但是我沒有。", "en": "What you can't see is the computer here,you only see the screen, but the main thing I worryabout in my computer is -- it doesn't have to be bigand powerful, although I like that -- it really has to be completely silent.

I was actually worried about the wholecommercial interests coming in."}, {"zh-tw": "我是說，我想大多數創業的人都會擔心這一點，就是他們擔心有人會占他們便宜，對吧？後來我決定「管他去死！」所以──克：之後有一天，有人貢獻了一些程式，而你這麼想：「哇，這真的很有意思，我從沒想過這點。這應該可以改進這個。」林：這甚至不是從有人貢獻程式開始，比較像是大家開始貢獻想法。", "en": "I mean, that's one of the worriesI think most people who start out have, is that they worry about somebodytaking advantage of their work, right?

This could actually improve this.\" LT: It didn't even startby people contributing code, it was more that peoplestarted contributing ideas."}, {"zh-tw": "光是這個事實，就是別人看了你的計劃──我確信別的事也一樣，但這在寫程式這件事上絕對是這樣──就是有人對你的程式有興趣，還仔細研究到能真的給你意見，給你想法。這對我是件大事。", "en": "And just the fact that somebody elsetakes a look at your project -- and I'm sure it's trueof other things, too, but it's definitely true in code -- is that somebody elsetakes an interest in your code, looks at it enough to actuallygive you feedback and give you ideas. That was a huge thing for me."}, {"zh-tw": "那時我 21 歲，是很年輕，但我基本上已經寫了半輩子的程式。在那之前每一件計劃都是我個人的東西，所以當大家開始評論，開始對你的程式給意見時，真的是一種啟示。", "en": "I was 21 at the time, so I was young, but I had already programmedfor half my life, basically. And every project before thathad been completely personal and it was a revelation when peoplejust started commenting, started giving feedback on your code."}, {"zh-tw": "甚至在他們開始回饋程式前，我想那是重要的一刻，因為我說：「我愛別人！」不要誤會，我不是一個喜歡社交的人。我不是真的愛別人──但是我愛電腦，我愛與別人用電郵互動，因為這好像給了你緩衝的空間。", "en": "And even before they startedgiving code back, that was, I think, one of the bigmoments where I said, \"I love other people!\" Don't get me wrong -- I'm actually not a people person. I don't really love other people -- But I love computers, I love interacting with otherpeople on email, because it kind of gives you that buffer."}, {"zh-tw": "但是我的確喜愛會評論並參與計劃的人。這使計劃豐富許多。", "en": "But I do love other people who commentand get involved in my project. And it made it so much more."}, {"zh-tw": "克：有沒有哪個時刻，你看到現有的專案突然大受歡迎，然後你想：「等一下，這應該會變成更大的東西，不再只是個人的計劃，可以得到一些很好的建議，而是有點像整個科技界的爆炸性進展？」林：其實沒有。我說真的，對我而言重點不是它變大的時候，而是它變小的時候。", "en": "CA: So was there a momentwhen you saw what was being built and it suddenly started taking off, and you thought, \"Wait a sec,this actually could be something huge, not just a personal projectthat I'm getting nice feedback on, but a kind of explosive developmentin the whole technology world\"? LT: Not really. I mean, the big point for me, really,was not when it was becoming huge, it was when it was becoming little."}, {"zh-tw": "對我而言重點是不再單打獨鬥，而是有十人，或許一百人參與，這是重點。然後其它的事都慢慢發生。", "en": "The big point for me was not being alone and having 10, maybe 100people being involved -- that was a big point. Then everything else was very gradual."}, {"zh-tw": "從一百人到一百萬人沒什麼了不起，對我而言。我是說，可能很了不起，如果你──如果你想賣你的結果那當然很了不起──不要誤會。", "en": "Going from 100 people to a million peopleis not a big deal -- to me. Well, I mean, maybe it is if you're -- If you want to sell your resultthen it's a huge deal -- don't get me wrong."}, {"zh-tw": "但是如果你是對科技有興趣，你對這計劃本身有興趣，那重點是建立一個社群。然後這個社群慢慢成長。", "en": "But if you're interested in the technology and you're interested in the project, the big part was getting the community. Then the community grew gradually."}, {"zh-tw": "其實並沒有什麼特別的時刻讓我覺得「哇，起飛了！」因為它──我是說──這真的花了相對而言很長的時間。克：跟我聊過的科技人都歸功你，說你完全改變了他們的工作。", "en": "And there's actually nota single point where I went like, \"Wow, that just took off!\" because it -- I mean -- it took a long time, relatively. CA: So all the technologiststhat I talk to really credit you with massively changing their work."}, {"zh-tw": "而且不只是 Linux，還有這個叫做 Git 的，這是一套軟體開發的（版本）管理系統。跟我們簡單說明一下你在其中的角色。", "en": "And it's not just Linux, it's this thing called Git, which is this management systemfor software development. Tell us briefly about thatand your role in that."}, {"zh-tw": "林：那時我們有一個問題，在做了一陣子之後才出現，就是當你──當你的計劃從十人或百人成長到一萬人，這個──就是說現在我們的情況是僅僅在核心部分，每次釋出新版本都有上千人參與，而且每兩個月，大約兩到三個月就釋出一次。", "en": "LT: So one of the issues we had, and this took a while to start to appear, is when you ... When you grow from having 10 peopleor 100 people working on a project to having 10,000 people, which -- I mean, right now we're in the situationwhere just on the kernel, we have 1,000 people involvedin every single release and that's every two months,roughly two or three months."}, {"zh-tw": "有些人做得不多。有很多人只做一點點修改。", "en": "Some of those people don't do a lot. There's a lot of peoplewho make small, small changes."}, {"zh-tw": "但是要維護這個，這樣的規模會改變你維護的方法。我們經歷了很多痛苦。", "en": "But to maintain this, the scale changes howyou have to maintain it. And we went through a lot of pain."}, {"zh-tw": "有很多計劃只能做原始碼維護。CVS （協作版本系統）過去是最常用的系統，我恨死了 CVS，堅決不肯使用它，我也試了其它激進有趣的東西，但是其他人卻恨死了。", "en": "And there are whole projectsthat do only source-code maintenance. CVS is the one that used to bethe most commonly used, and I hated CVS with a passionand refused to touch it and tried something elsethat was radical and interesting and everybody else hated."}, {"zh-tw": "克：林：我們處在很糟的情況，我們有數千人想要參與，但是從很多方面看，我都是那個中斷點，我無法放大自己的格局到能與數千人一同工作。所以 Git 是我的第二個大型計畫，是專門為我打造，以維護我的第一個大型計畫，", "en": "CA: (Laughs) LT: And we were in this bad spot, where we had thousands of peoplewho wanted to participate, but in many ways,I was the kind of break point, where I could not scale to the point where I could workwith thousands of people. So Git is my second big project, which was only created for meto maintain my first big project."}, {"zh-tw": "這真的就是我工作的方式。我寫程式不是為了──嗯，我的確會為了好玩寫程式──但是我想寫有意義的程式，所以我完成的每一項計畫都是我需要的東西，而且──克：所以真的，Linux 和 Git 兩者的出現幾乎都是你不想與很多人一同工作而產生意料之外的結果。", "en": "And this is literally how I work. I don't code for -- well, I do code for fun -- but I want to codefor something meaningful so every single project I've ever donehas been something I needed and -- CA: So really, both Linuxand Git kind of arose almost as an unintended consequence of your desire not to haveto work with too many people."}, {"zh-tw": "林：一點也沒錯！是的！克：真了不起。林：是的。", "en": "LT: Absolutely. Yes. CA: That's amazing.LT: Yeah."}, {"zh-tw": "然而，你是轉變科技的人，不只一次，而是二次，我們得試著瞭解為什麼會這樣。你給了我們一些線索，但是……", "en": "And yet, you're the manwho's transformed technology not just once but twice, and we have to tryand understand why it is.

My younger sister,who's not in the picture, when we had family meetings -- and it's not a huge family, but I have,like, a couple of cousins -- she would prep me beforehand."}, {"zh-tw": "像在我踏進房門之前她會說：「看好，這是誰和誰……」因為我不──我很宅。我非常投入電腦，我非常投入數學，我非常投入物理。", "en": "Like, before I steppedinto the room she would say, \"OK. That's so-and-so ...\" Because I was not -- I was a geek. I was into computers, I was into math, I was into physics."}, {"zh-tw": "我那項很強。我從不認為自己很超凡。", "en": "I was good at that.

So that's not about beinga geek and being smart, that's about being ... stubborn? LT: That's about being stubborn."}, {"zh-tw": "那就像，你才開始了什麼，你不會說：「好！不玩了！來做別的吧……看！那個好亮！」我注意到我在生活其它方面上也看得到這個特質。我在矽谷住了七年。", "en": "That's about, like, just starting something and not saying, \"OK, I'm done,let's do something else -- Look: shiny!\" And I notice that in manyother parts in my life, too. I lived in Silicon Valley for seven years."}, {"zh-tw": "我都待在同一家公司，在矽谷！整段時間。這簡直是前所未聞。", "en": "And I worked for the samecompany, in Silicon Valley, for the whole time. That is unheard of."}, {"zh-tw": "矽谷不是這樣的。矽谷的重點就是大家在不同的公司跳來跳去，好像大熔爐一樣。", "en": "That's not how Silicon Valley works. The whole point of Silicon Valleyis that people jump between jobs to kind of mix up the pot."}, {"zh-tw": "但我不是那種人。克：但是在 Linux 本身實際開發期間，那種固執的態度有時候會帶來人際間的衝突。", "en": "And that's not the kind of person I am. CA: But during the actualdevelopment of Linux itself, that stubbornness sometimes broughtyou in conflict with other people."}, {"zh-tw": "跟我們談談這一點。是不是一定要維持做出來的東西的品質？你會怎麼說那時的情況？林：我不知道那是不是必要的。", "en": "Talk about that a bit. Was that essential to sort of maintainthe quality of what was being built? How would you describe what happened? LT: I don't know if it's essential."}, {"zh-tw": "回到我說我不善社交那部分，有的時候我也……怎麼說呢，在說到別人的感覺時，我是「大近視」！有時候會讓你說出傷人的話。", "en": "Going back to the \"I'm nota people person,\" -- sometimes I'm also ... shall we say, \"myopic\" when it comesto other people's feelings, and that sometimes makes yousay things that hurt other people."}, {"zh-tw": "我一點都不引以為豪。但是同時，那是……我碰到有人對我說我應該更和藹一點。", "en": "And I'm not proud of that.

What I'm trying to sayis we are different."}, {"zh-tw": "我不善社交；這不是我特別引以為傲的事情，但是這就是我的一部分。我真的很喜歡開放原始碼的一件事，就是它真的讓不同的人一同合作。", "en": "I'm not a people person; it's not somethingI'm particularly proud of, but it's part of me. And one of the thingsI really like about open source is it really allows differentpeople to work together."}, {"zh-tw": "我們不必喜歡對方，而且有的時候我們真的不喜歡對方，我是說真的，的確有很火爆的爭論發生。", "en": "We don't have to like each other -- and sometimes we reallydon't like each other. Really -- I mean, there are very,very heated arguments."}, {"zh-tw": "但是你真的，你可以看到事情是你甚至不用刻意同意大家意見不同，那真的只是你對不同的事情有興趣。回到我之前說的那一點，我很怕生意人占你的工作成果的便宜，結果，而且是很快就看到的結果，那些生意人都是非常可愛的人。", "en": "But you can, actually,you can find things that -- you don't even agree to disagree, it's just that you're interestedin really different things.

And they used open source in waysthat I just did not want to go."}, {"zh-tw": "但是因為這是開放原始碼，所以他們可以那麼做，其實我們合作得很不錯。我覺得這件事也一樣。", "en": "But because it was opensource they could do it, and it actually worksreally beautifully together.

I can't do UI to save my life."}, {"zh-tw": "我是說，如果我被困在某個島上，唯一能逃離那個島的方法是做一個漂亮的 UI，我會死在那裡。所以每個人都不一樣，我不是在找藉口，我只是試著解釋。", "en": "I mean, if I was stranded on an island and the only way to get off that islandwas the make a pretty UI, I'd die there. So there's different kinds of people, and I'm not making excuses,I'm trying to explain."}, {"zh-tw": "克：上星期我們聊的時候，你談到你其它的特點，我覺得很有意思，就是這個「品味」的想法。", "en": "CA: Now, when we talked last week, you talked about someother trait that you have, which I found really interesting. It's this idea called taste."}, {"zh-tw": "我這裡有幾張照片。我想這是寫程式的品味不太好的例子，這張的品味比較好，你可以立刻發現。", "en": "And I've just got a couple of images here. I think this is an example of notparticularly good taste in code, and this one is better taste, which one can immediately see."}, {"zh-tw": "這兩個有什麼不同？林：所以這是——這裡有多少人真的寫過程式？克：天啊！林：所以我向你保證，每一位舉手的人，他們都做過 singly-linked list（單向連結串列）。", "en": "What is the difference between these two? LT: So this is -- How many people here actually have coded? CA: Oh my goodness. LT: So I guarantee you, everybody who raised their hand, they have done what's calleda singly-linked list."}, {"zh-tw": "它教……這個，第一張不太有品味的方法，基本上就是你一開始學寫程式時教的方法。你不用懂這個程式。", "en": "And it's taught -- This, the first not verygood taste approach, is basically how it's taught to be donewhen you start out coding. And you don't have to understand the code."}, {"zh-tw": "對我而言最有趣的部分是這個最後的 if 敘述(if statement)。因為在單向連結串列裡，這裡是要試著從資料清單中移除一筆現有的資料，這是第一筆資料還是中間的資料會有點不一樣。", "en": "The most interesting part to me is the last if statement. Because what happensin a singly-linked list -- this is trying to removean existing entry from a list -- and there's a differencebetween if it's the first entry or whether it's an entry in the middle."}, {"zh-tw": "因為如果這是第一筆資料，你就必須把指標指向第一筆資料，如果資料在清單中間，你就必須把指標指向該資料的前一筆資料。", "en": "Because if it's the first entry, you have to changethe pointer to the first entry. If it's in the middle, you have to change the pointerof a previous entry."}, {"zh-tw": "所以這是兩個完全不同的例子。克：那樣比較好。", "en": "So they're two completely different cases. CA: And that's better."}, {"zh-tw": "林：這樣比較好。它沒有 if 敘述。", "en": "LT: And this is better. It does not have the if statement."}, {"zh-tw": "這一點也不重要，我不是要你瞭解為什麼它沒有 if 敘述，但我要你瞭解有時候你可以用不同的角度看問題，並重寫它，那麼例外就會消失，變成普通情況。那就是好的程式。", "en": "And it doesn't really matter -- I don't want you understandwhy it doesn't have the if statement, but I want you to understand that sometimes you can seea problem in a different way and rewrite it so thata special case goes away and becomes the normal case. And that's good code."}, {"zh-tw": "但這是簡單的程式。是必修的程式設計入門。", "en": "But this is simple code. This is CS 101."}, {"zh-tw": "這不重要，但是細節很重要。對我而言，我真的很想一同工作的人都有個現象，就是他們有好的品味，", "en": "This is not important --although, details are important. To me, the sign of peopleI really want to work with is that they have good taste,which is how ..."}, {"zh-tw": "我給你的這個例子很笨，一點都不相干，因為太小了。好的品味比這個大多了。", "en": "I sent you this stupid example that is not relevantbecause it's too small. Good taste is much bigger than this."}, {"zh-tw": "好的品味是你真的會看到大的模式，而且好像有直覺知道什麼是正確的方法。克：好，所以我們現在可以拼湊出整體的樣子了。", "en": "Good taste is about reallyseeing the big patterns and kind of instinctively knowingwhat's the right way to do things. CA: OK, so we're puttingthe pieces together here now."}, {"zh-tw": "你有品味，而且這個品味對寫軟體的人而言有意義。你是……林：我想這對這裡的某些人有意義。", "en": "You have taste, in a way that's meaningfulto software people. You're -- LT: I think it was meaningfulto some people here."}, {"zh-tw": "克：你是非常聰明的電腦程式設計師，而且你頑固的要命。但是一定還有什麼。", "en": "CA: You're a very smart computer coder, and you're hellish stubborn.

In many other areas -- I mean, people have talked aboutopen politics and things like that -- and it's really hard sometimes to say that, yes, you can apply the sameprinciples in some other areas just because the black and whiteturns into not just gray, but different colors.
