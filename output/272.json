Interestingly, I asked this questionwhen I was a little kid. I grew up in the South Bronx,inner-city ghetto in New York, and I was surrounded by evil, as all kids are who grew upin an inner city."}, {"zh-tw": "我有一些朋友，他們曾是好孩子，但他們的人生卻如同羅伯特·路易斯·斯蒂文森筆下的變身怪醫，由善轉惡。他們染毒，惹了麻煩，然後進了監獄。", "en": "And I had friendswho were really good kids, who lived out the Dr. Jekyll Mr. Hydescenario -- Robert Louis Stevenson. That is, they took drugs,got in trouble, went to jail."}, {"zh-tw": "有些喪了命，即使並沒有沾染毒品。所以當我讀羅伯特·路易斯·斯蒂文森的作品時，我覺得那不是小說。", "en": "Some got killed, and some did itwithout drug assistance. So when I read Robert Louis Stevenson,that wasn't fiction."}, {"zh-tw": "唯一的問題是：釀成由善轉惡的毒藥是什麼？更重要的是，善惡之間的界限——特權階層喜歡認定這個界限是固定且不可逾越的，認為他們是在善的一邊，其他人在惡的一邊——而我以前就知道這個界限是可以移動的，而且是可逾越的。好人可以受誘惑而越界，偶爾在某些比較好的情況下，壞孩子也可能依靠外界的幫助、改造、治療，以重塑人生。", "en": "The only question is,what was in the juice? And more importantly, that linebetween good and evil -- which privileged people like to thinkis fixed and impermeable, with them on the good side,the others on the bad side -- I knew that line was movable,and it was permeable. Good people could beseduced across that line, and under good and some rarecircumstances, bad kids could recover with help, with reform,with rehabilitation."}, {"zh-tw": "所以，我想以荷蘭藝術家M. C. Escher這幅奇妙的作品開始說起。如果你把視線集中在白色區域，你會看到一個充滿了天使的世界。", "en": "So I want to beginwith this wonderful illusion by [Dutch] artist M.C. Escher. If you look at it and focus on the white,what you see is a world full of angels."}, {"zh-tw": "但是當我們再靠近一點看，魔鬼就出現了，世間的魔鬼。這告訴我們幾點。", "en": "But let's look more deeply, and as we do, what appears is the demons,the devils in the world. That tells us several things."}, {"zh-tw": "一：這個世界，無論過去，現在，還是將來，都總是由善和惡組成，因為善惡就如人類的陰陽。它也告訴我另外一件事。如果你還記得，", "en": "One, the world is, was, will alwaysbe filled with good and evil, because good and evil is the yin and yangof the human condition. It tells me something else."}, {"zh-tw": "上帝最喜歡的天使是路西法。顯然，路西法的意思是“光明”。在某些經文裡，它也有“黎明之星”的意思。", "en": "If you remember,God's favorite angel was Lucifer. Apparently, Lucifer means \"the light.\" It also means \"the morning star,\"in some scripture."}, {"zh-tw": "顯然他後來背叛了上帝，這是對權威的終極背叛。當他率眾背叛後，上帝派邁克天使長將他和其他墮落的天使一起趕出天堂。", "en": "And apparently, he disobeyed God, and that's the ultimatedisobedience to authority. And when he did, Michael, the archangel,was sent to kick him out of heaven along with the other fallen angels."}, {"zh-tw": "於是路西法降入地獄，成為撒旦，成為惡魔，宇宙中的惡之能量誕生了。矛盾的是，是上帝造出了惡的容身之處---地獄。", "en": "And so Lucifer descends into hell,becomes Satan, becomes the devil, and the forceof evil in the universe begins. Paradoxically, it was Godwho created hell as a place to store evil."}, {"zh-tw": "他卻沒能使惡一直呆在那裡。所以，從上帝最受寵的天使變為惡魔，這個巨大的轉變，為我設立了一個大背景，去理解那些從好人或者普通人轉變成壞人的人。", "en": "He didn't do a good jobof keeping it there though. So, this arc of the cosmic transformationof God's favorite angel into the Devil, for me, sets the contextfor understanding human beings who are transformed from good,ordinary people into perpetrators of evil."}, {"zh-tw": "所以，路西法效應，儘管它集中在陰暗的方面——人們可能投向陰暗，但他們本身並非陰暗——引導我作出一個心理學定義：惡是行使權力這才是關鍵：權力。", "en": "So the Lucifer effect,although it focuses on the negatives -- the negatives that people can become, not the negatives that people are -- leads me to a psychological definition. Evil is the exercise of power."}, {"zh-tw": "來故意對他人進行心理傷害，對他人進行身體傷害，殘害他人生命或思想，犯下反人道的罪行。", "en": "And that's the key: it's about power.

These pictures areof a violent or sexual nature."}, {"zh-tw": "所有這些都是美軍士兵用相機拍攝的。因為每個人都有數位相機或手機相機，他們什麼都拍。拍了超過1000張照片。", "en": "All of them come from the camerasof American soldiers. Because everybody hasa digital camera or cell phone camera, they took pictures of everything,more than 1,000."}, {"zh-tw": "我所做的是把它們分類。但這些由陸軍預備役的美軍憲兵所拍攝的。", "en": "And what I've done is I organized theminto various categories.

And it all happened in a single place,Tier 1-A, on the night shift."}, {"zh-tw": "為什麼？ 1A層是軍方情報中心。是審訊關押處。中央情報局在那裡。", "en": "Why? Tier 1-A was the centerfor military intelligence. It was the interrogation hold."}, {"zh-tw": "巨人公司（美軍外包公司）的審訊人員，全部都在那裡，而他們得不到任何關於暴動的信息。於是他們向這些憲兵隊士兵施加壓力，", "en": "The CIA was there. Interrogators fromTitan Corporation, all there, and they're getting no informationabout the insurgency."}, {"zh-tw": "迫使他們越線，允許他們採取措施來擊潰敵人的意志，挽起袖子，為審訊做準備，使他們屈服。這些都是婉辭，而這就是他們如何闡釋的。", "en": "So they're going to put pressureon these soldiers, military police, to cross the line, give them permission to breakthe will of the enemy, to prepare them for interrogation,to soften them up, to take the gloves off.

Who are the bad apples?\" Well, that's a bad question. You have to reframe it and ask,\"What is responsible?\" \"What\" could be the who of people, but it could also bethe what of the situation, and obviously that's wrongheaded."}, {"zh-tw": "那麼心理學家是如何理解這種人性的轉變呢？如果你相信他們在進入地牢之前是好士兵的話。有三種方式。最主要的方式是所謂的特質論。我們查看那些壞蘋果的內在特徵。", "en": "How do psychologists try to understandsuch transformations of human character, if you believethat they were good soldiers before they went down to that dungeon? There are three ways.The main way is called dispositional. We look at what's insideof the person, the bad apples."}, {"zh-tw": "這是所有社會科學的基礎，宗教的基礎，戰爭的基礎。像我這樣的社會心理學家會出來說，\"是啊，人們是舞台上的演員，但你得清楚其所處的情境。", "en": "This is the foundationof all of social science, the foundation of religion,the foundation of war.

Is there a stage director?\" And so we're interested inwhat are the external factors around the individual -- the bad barrel? Social scientists stop thereand they miss the big point that I discovered when I becamean expert witness for Abu Ghraib. The power is in the system."}, {"zh-tw": "系統製造出腐化個體的情境，這個系統，是指法制、政治、經濟和文化背景。該系統即蘋果桶製造者權力之所在。", "en": "The system creates the situationthat corrupts the individuals, and the system is the legal, political,economic, cultural background. And this is where the poweris of the bad-barrel makers."}, {"zh-tw": "如果你想改變一個人，你就得改變其所處的情境。如果你要改變情境，你得知道其權力存在於系統的何處。所以路西法效應牽涉到理解", "en": "If you want to change a person,change the situation. And to change it, you've got to knowwhere the power is, in the system."}, {"zh-tw": "人性轉變是如何受這三項因素影響的。它是一個相互作用的過程。", "en": "So the Lucifer effectinvolves understanding human character transformationswith these three factors.
