For me, it just took 11,000 volts. I know you're too polite to ask, so I will tell you."}, {"zh-tw": "在我大學二年級的一個晚上剛從感恩節假期回來我們幾個朋友正在四處嬉戲打鬧我們決定爬上一台停著的通勤列車它就停在那，電纜線高掛在上面", "en": "One night, sophomore year of college, just back from Thanksgiving holiday, a few of my friends and Iwere horsing around, and we decided to climb atopa parked commuter train. It was just sitting there,with the wires that run overhead."}, {"zh-tw": "不知怎麼回事，當時感覺這個主意棒透了但我們肯定是幹了些蠢事", "en": "Somehow, that seemedlike a great idea at the time. We'd certainly done stupider things."}, {"zh-tw": "我快速爬上了背後的梯子而當我站上去時電流竄進我的手臂一路往下竄，從我的雙腳流出，結果就是現在你們看到的情況你們相信手錶竟然還能用嗎?遭受重擊 (廣告台詞前半段，後接\"仍不懈怠\")我父親現在仍因為支持而戴著它", "en": "I scurried up the ladder on the back, and when I stood up, the electrical current entered my arm, blew down and out my feet,and that was that. Would you believe that watch still works? Takes a licking! My father wears it now in solidarity."}, {"zh-tw": "那夜開始了我和死亡的關係-- 自己的死亡 --也同時開啟了我漫長的傷患生涯傷患 -- 這是個詞語好用", "en": "That night began my formal relationshipwith death -- my death -- and it also beganmy long run as a patient. It's a good word."}, {"zh-tw": "意思是遭受痛苦的人所以我想我們都算是傷患", "en": "It means one who suffers. So I guess we're all patients."}, {"zh-tw": "現在，美國的醫療體系有太多的不良之處當然也有好的地方我現在是個醫生，負責安寧療護和緩和藥物治療所以醫生病患兩方的觀點我都看過", "en": "Now, the American health care system has more than its fair shareof dysfunction -- to match its brilliance, to be sure. I'm a physician now,a hospice and palliative medicine doc, so I've seen care from both sides."}, {"zh-tw": "相信我，幾乎所有進入醫療體系的人都是基於非常良善的意圖 -- 我說真的但在我們醫療體系裡的人都不知道這個體系經常運作不良", "en": "And believe me: almost everyonewho goes into healthcare really means well -- I mean, truly. But we who work in itare also unwitting agents for a system that too oftendoes not serve."}, {"zh-tw": "為什麼?事實上，這個問題的答案很簡單也解釋了很多事：因為醫療系統設計是針對疾病，而不是病人也就是說，必然沒有經過很好的設計", "en": "Why? Well, there's actually a pretty easyanswer to that question, and it explains a lot: because healthcare was designedwith diseases, not people, at its center. Which is to say, of course,it was badly designed."}, {"zh-tw": "而設計錯誤造成更多傷害或是優良設計帶來生命終結前的強制醫療那令事情更淨化和集中再也沒有重新開始的機會", "en": "And nowhere are the effectsof bad design more heartbreaking or the opportunityfor good design more compelling than at the end of life, where things are so distilledand concentrated. There are no do-overs."}, {"zh-tw": "我今天希望能向各領域傳達一個訊息邀請大家將設計思維帶入這段重要對談也就是將良好的意圖和創意帶入死亡的體驗裡", "en": "My purpose today isto reach out across disciplines and invite design thinkinginto this big conversation. That is, to bring intention and creativity to the experience of dying."}, {"zh-tw": "在我們面前有極其難得的機會以個人和公民社會的身分思考其中一個普遍的議題之前重新思考和設計如何死亡這件事情所以讓我們從一切的終點開始談起", "en": "We have a monumentalopportunity in front of us, before one of the few universal issues as individuals as well as a civil society: to rethink and redesign how it is we die. So let's begin at the end."}, {"zh-tw": "對大部分的人而言，死亡最恐怖的事不是變成死人而是臨終及遭受痛苦這是個關鍵的區別", "en": "For most people, the scariest thingabout death isn't being dead, it's dying, suffering. It's a key distinction."}, {"zh-tw": "要處理這件問題，非常效的做法是將死亡無法避免的痛苦從我們可以改變的痛苦中抽離出來前者是自然發生的過程，生命的本質，如同一個談好的條件這讓我們為自己預留空間，自我調整、成長", "en": "To get underneath this,it can be very helpful to tease out sufferingwhich is necessary as it is, from suffering we can change. The former is a natural,essential part of life, part of the deal, and to this we are calledto make space, adjust, grow."}, {"zh-tw": "認識比自己強大的力量是件好事它帶來了均衡性像個全面性的重新調整", "en": "It can be really goodto realize forces larger than ourselves. They bring proportionality, like a cosmic right-sizing."}, {"zh-tw": "舉例來說，在我失去肢體之後那種損失變成了事實，無可改變變成生命中必然的部分我發現不再拒絕接受這個事實，因為那等同拒絕自己花了一點時間，但我最後還是發現了", "en": "After my limbs were gone, that loss, for example,became fact, fixed -- necessarily part of my life, and I learned that I could no morereject this fact than reject myself. It took me a while,but I learned it eventually."}, {"zh-tw": "這種無可避免的痛苦帶來另一件好事就是它正是可以連結醫護照顧者和接受者- 也就是人 - 的事我們最後發現，這就是真正的治療", "en": "Now, another great thingabout necessary suffering is that it is the very thing that unites caregiver and care receiver -- human beings. This, we are finally realizing,is where healing happens."}, {"zh-tw": "是的，同情 -- 如同我們昨天所學到的 --一起受苦至於另一方面 -- 系統這面卻製造了許多不必要的痛苦", "en": "Yes, compassion -- literally,as we learned yesterday -- suffering together. Now, on the systems side,on the other hand, so much of the sufferingis unnecessary, invented."}, {"zh-tw": "沒有絲毫好處但好消息是，既然這是人製造出來的那我們就可以改變它", "en": "It serves no good purpose. But the good news is,since this brand of suffering is made up, well, we can change it."}, {"zh-tw": "如何死亡肯定是我們能影響的事讓整個系統對於必要和非必要痛苦之間的區隔更加靈敏這給了我們三個設計暗示中的第一個", "en": "How we die is indeedsomething we can affect. Making the system sensitiveto this fundamental distinction between necessaryand unnecessary suffering gives us our first of threedesign cues for the day."}, {"zh-tw": "追根究柢，我們醫護照顧者的角色是為了要緩和痛苦，不是雪上加霜這是慢性治療的宗旨我代表了典型支持者差不多是一位規定內科醫師", "en": "After all, our role as caregivers,as people who care, is to relieve suffering --not add to the pile. True to the tenets of palliative care, I function as somethingof a reflective advocate, as much as prescribing physician."}, {"zh-tw": "順道快速說明：慢性治療是個重要領域但其實沒有正確地被理解它涵蓋範圍不是止於生命結束也不止於安寧療護", "en": "Quick aside: palliative care -- a veryimportant field but poorly understood -- while it includes, it is notlimited to end of life care. It is not limited to hospice."}, {"zh-tw": "它純粹是讓病患在任何階段都能舒適地好好活著所以你不是在快要死去的時候才能從慢性治療中得到好處", "en": "It's simply about comfortand living well at any stage. So please know that you don'thave to be dying anytime soon to benefit from palliative care."}, {"zh-tw": "現在，讓我為你們介紹法蘭克他可說是印證了這件事", "en": "Now, let me introduce you to Frank. Sort of makes this point."}, {"zh-tw": "我照顧了法蘭克好些年了他一直與前列腺癌和愛滋病毒為吾", "en": "I've been seeing Frank now for years. He's living with advancing prostate canceron top of long-standing HIV."}, {"zh-tw": "我們針對他的骨痛和疲勞問題進行診療但大部分的時間其實花在一起思考他的人生-- 真的，關於我們的人生這麼做讓法蘭克更悲傷", "en": "We work on his bone pain and his fatigue, but most of the time we spend thinkingout loud together about his life -- really, about our lives. In this way, Frank grieves."}, {"zh-tw": "因為不斷面對失去，讓他一直處於喪去之中所以他決定要朝下一刻邁進失去是一回事，但後悔是另一回事", "en": "In this way, he keeps up withhis losses as they roll in, so that he's ready to take inthe next moment. Loss is one thing,but regret, quite another."}, {"zh-tw": "法蘭克一直是個冒險家他看來不是諾曼‧洛克威爾畫作裡的人物和從不會後悔所以當他某天跑進診所說他想扒木筏到科羅拉多河去的時候，一點也不令人意外", "en": "Frank has always been an adventurer -- he looks like somethingout of a Norman Rockwell painting -- and no fan of regret. So it wasn't surprisingwhen he came into clinic one day, saying he wanted to raftdown the Colorado River."}, {"zh-tw": "那是個好主意嗎?以他人生安全和健康狀況做評估，一些人或許會說不是很多人則說是，但他去了，趁他還能辦到的時候", "en": "Was this a good idea? With all the risks to his safetyand his health, some would say no. Many did, but he went for it,while he still could."}, {"zh-tw": "那是個美妙而非凡的旅程：冰凍的水、極度乾熱、蠍子、蛇大峽谷火焰般的崖壁中不斷傳來野生動物的咆哮超越我們控制的，世界壯麗的一面法蘭克的決定，可能有點戲劇性但確實是我們許多人會做的那種決定如果我們只堅持一些永遠對我們都是最好的決定", "en": "It was a glorious, marvelous trip: freezing water, blistering dry heat,scorpions, snakes, wildlife howling off the flaming wallsof the Grand Canyon -- all the glorious side of the worldbeyond our control. Frank's decision, while maybe dramatic, is exactly the kindso many of us would make, if we only had the support to figure outwhat is best for ourselves over time."}, {"zh-tw": "那麼今天我們談的，主要是觀點的移轉在意外發生後，當我回到大學時我將主修改為藝術史", "en": "So much of what we're talking about todayis a shift in perspective. After my accident,when I went back to college, I changed my major to art history."}, {"zh-tw": "透過研究視覺藝術，我發現我學到一些如何「看」--對一個無法改變太多過去所見的孩子而言這是非常強而有力的一課觀點 -- 這種人類可以控制的鍊金術足以將痛苦轉換為一朵盛開的花", "en": "Studying visual art, I figuredI'd learn something about how to see -- a really potent lessonfor a kid who couldn't change so much of what he was seeing. Perspective, that kind of alchemywe humans get to play with, turning anguish into a flower."}, {"zh-tw": "往前快轉：現在我在舊金山一個很棒的地方工作叫做《禪安寧照護計畫》在那裡我們有一個幫助這種觀點移轉的小小儀式當我們有一位房客過世太平間的人來了，而當我們將遺體穿過花園朝大門前進時，會先暫停一下", "en": "Flash forward: now I workat an amazing place in San Francisco called the Zen Hospice Project, where we have a little ritualthat helps with this shift in perspective. When one of our residents dies, the mortuary men come, and as we'rewheeling the body out through the garden, heading for the gate, we pause."}, {"zh-tw": "任何人，只要他想要 --不管是其他房客、家屬、護士、義工還有靈車司機 --都可以分享一個故事、唱一首歌，或者單純的靜默就在我們在遺體上撒花瓣時這會花幾分鐘的時間這是個甜蜜而簡單的告別象徵，用溫暖迎接悲痛而不是厭惡", "en": "Anyone who wants -- fellow residents, family,nurses, volunteers, the hearse drivers too, now -- shares a story or a song or silence, as we sprinkle the bodywith flower petals. It takes a few minutes; it's a sweet, simple parting imageto usher in grief with warmth, rather than repugnance."}, {"zh-tw": "對比於醫院裡設定的典型體驗差不多像這樣 -- 泛光照射的房間裡排滿管線和嗶嗶叫的機器病患死亡時仍不停閃爍的燈光清潔人員衝進房間，快速搬走遺體一切感覺就像這個人不曾真的存在過", "en": "Contrast that with the typical experiencein the hospital setting, much like this -- floodlit roomlined with tubes and beeping machines and blinking lights that don't stopeven when the patient's life has. Cleaning crew swoops in,the body's whisked away, and it all feels as though that personhad never really existed."}, {"zh-tw": "無菌考量，當然是個良好意圖但醫院很容易侵犯我們的感官在那些生冷的牆壁裡我們最多能渴望的大概就是麻木麻木不仁，跟美完全相反我為醫院能做到的事情尊敬他們；他們是我還活著的原因", "en": "Well-intended, of course,in the name of sterility, but hospitals tend to assault our senses, and the most we might hope forwithin those walls is numbness -- anesthetic, literallythe opposite of aesthetic. I revere hospitals for what they can do;I am alive because of them."}, {"zh-tw": "但我們對他們的要求太多了他們是處理急性創傷和可治癒疾病的地方", "en": "But we ask too much of our hospitals. They are places for acute traumaand treatable illness."}, {"zh-tw": "而不是處理生死的地方；他們不是為此設計的現在提醒各位 -- 我並沒有放棄我們的醫療機構需要更人性化的想法", "en": "They are no place to live and die;that's not what they were designed for. Now mind you -- I am notgiving up on the notion that our institutionscan become more humane."}, {"zh-tw": "美好的事物隨處可見我在燒燙中心裡待了幾個月在紐澤西利文斯頓的聖巴拿巴醫院裡在那裡我每次都受到很好的照顧包含針對疼痛所做的慢性治療", "en": "Beauty can be found anywhere. I spent a few months in a burn unit at St. Barnabas Hospitalin Livingston, New Jersey, where I got reallygreat care at every turn, including goodpalliative care for my pain."}, {"zh-tw": "在一個晚上，外面開始下雪我記得護士們正在抱怨要開車穿越雪地", "en": "And one night, it began to snow outside. I remember my nursescomplaining about driving through it."}, {"zh-tw": "我的房間沒有窗戶但光是想像濕軟的雪花落下也很不錯隔天，其中一個護士為我偷偷帶進了一個雪球", "en": "And there was no window in my room, but it was great to just imagine itcoming down all sticky. Next day, one of my nursessmuggled in a snowball for me."}, {"zh-tw": "她將雪球帶進燒燙中心我無法形容那種歡天喜地的感覺，就當我感受到它就在我手中一股股濕冷滴落在我滾燙的皮膚上那一切奇蹟似的感受當我看著它融化為水的那種陶醉", "en": "She brought it in to the unit. I cannot tell you the rapture I feltholding that in my hand, and the coldness drippingonto my burning skin; the miracle of it all, the fascination as I watched it meltand turn into water."}, {"zh-tw": "在那個時刻感覺自己屬於這個世界、這個宇宙的任何部分對我而言，比會活下來還是死掉重要這顆小小雪球給了我需要的所有激勵無論是試著活下來還是接受死亡", "en": "In that moment, just being any part of this planetin this universe mattered more to me than whether I lived or died. That little snowball packedall the inspiration I needed to both try to liveand be OK if I did not."}, {"zh-tw": "在醫院裡，那段是被偷走的時刻在我多年的工作裡，認識了許多準備離開、準備好死亡的人", "en": "In a hospital, that's a stolen moment. In my work over the years,I've known many people who were ready to go, ready to die."}, {"zh-tw": "並非找到最後的安寧或超然而是被他們生命最終變成的樣貌給擊敗一言以蔽之，隔絕, 醜陋活在長期病痛或絕症中的人數已經達到歷史新高年齡也不斷攀升", "en": "Not because they had foundsome final peace or transcendence, but because they were so repulsedby what their lives had become -- in a word, cut off, or ugly. There are already record numbers of usliving with chronic and terminal illness, and into ever older age."}, {"zh-tw": "我們完全還沒為這個銀色海嘯做好準備我們需要建立基礎設施有足夠的動力應付這股人口結構轉移的震盪", "en": "And we are nowhere near readyor prepared for this silver tsunami. We need an infrastructuredynamic enough to handle these seismic shifts in our population."}, {"zh-tw": "現在正是時候創造一些全新的、不可或缺的東西我知道我們可以，因為我們必須這麼做", "en": "Now is the time to createsomething new, something vital. I know we can because we have to."}, {"zh-tw": "沒有其他選擇而廣為人知的重要要素有：政策、教育和訓練系統、建築物", "en": "The alternative is just unacceptable. And the key ingredients are known: policy, education and training, systems, bricks and mortar."}, {"zh-tw": "我們有以頓計的訊息可讓各種不同的設計師進行作業舉例來說，從研究中得知對接近死亡的人們而言，最重要的是：舒適；感覺沒有牽掛，並不再牽累他們所愛的人心境平靜，感覺美妙和充滿靈性", "en": "We have tons of inputfor designers of all stripes to work with. We know, for example, from research what's most important to peoplewho are closer to death: comfort; feeling unburdenedand unburdening to those they love; existential peace; and a senseof wonderment and spirituality."}, {"zh-tw": "在《禪安寧療護》的近30年裡我們從房客一些細微的瑣事中學到許多這些小事其實不小", "en": "Over Zen Hospice's nearly 30 years, we've learned much morefrom our residents in subtle detail. Little things aren't so little."}, {"zh-tw": "就拿珍妮特來說由於患有漸凍人症(ALS)，她發現一天比一天難以呼吸", "en": "Take Janette. She finds it harder to breatheone day to the next due to ALS."}, {"zh-tw": "猜猜怎麼樣?她想要再次開始抽菸而且是法國菸，如果可以的話並不是因為她有自我毀滅的傾向而是想在她失去她的肺之前，感覺裡面被充滿", "en": "Well, guess what? She wants to start smoking again -- and French cigarettes, if you please. Not out of some self-destructive bent, but to feel her lungs filledwhile she has them."}, {"zh-tw": "優先次序有所不同了或是凱特 -- 她只想知道她的狗奧斯丁是否躺在床尾用冷冷的口鼻貼在她乾燥的皮膚上而不是更多化療的液體在靜脈裡流竄那些她經歷過了", "en": "Priorities change. Or Kate -- she just wants to know her dog Austin is lyingat the foot of her bed, his cold muzzle against her dry skin, instead of more chemotherapycoursing through her veins -- she's done that."}, {"zh-tw": "感官與美的滿足，在那一刻立即變成我們活著的獎勵我們能用來珍愛剩餘時間的方式，最終大多只剩下感官或者身體 -- 千真萬確經歷活著和死亡的東西", "en": "Sensuous, aesthetic gratification,where in a moment, in an instant, we are rewarded for just being. So much of it comes down toloving our time by way of the senses, by way of the body -- the very thingdoing the living and the dying."}, {"zh-tw": "《禪安寧療護》的客房裡氣味最濃烈的地方大概就是廚房了這有點奇怪，如果你發現我們許多房客就算能進食，也非常少量但我們意識到，其實在許多層面上我們都在提供維持生計的東西例如氣味，非常象徵性的層面", "en": "Probably the most poignant room in the Zen Hospice guest houseis our kitchen, which is a little strange when you realize that so many of our residentscan eat very little, if anything at all. But we realize we are providingsustenance on several levels: smell, a symbolic plane."}, {"zh-tw": "說認真的，在我們的許多重責大任之中其中一項最常用、最真切的治療方式就是烘焙餅乾只要我們還擁有感官 --儘管只有任何一種 --就至少還有機會接近感覺自己還像個人、和世界連結", "en": "Seriously, with all the heavy-duty stuffhappening under our roof, one of the most tried and trueinterventions we know of, is to bake cookies. As long as we have our senses -- even just one -- we have at leastthe possibility of accessing what makes us feel human, connected."}, {"zh-tw": "想像一下這個觀點的效應：幾百萬人在失智症中經歷生死的轉換最原始的感官上的愉悅，說明了我們無法形容的事一股讓我們把注意力放在現在的衝動無需在意過去或未來", "en": "Imagine the ripples of this notion for the millions of peopleliving and dying with dementia. Primal sensorial delights that saythe things we don't have words for, impulses that make us stay present -- no need for a past or a future."}, {"zh-tw": "所以，如果把不必要的痛苦從醫療體系中抽離是第一個設計提示那麼在感官上、身體上顧到人們的尊嚴-- 達到美的境界 --則是我們的第二個設計提示這也快速帶到了第三個設計提示，也是今天最後一個段落也就是，我們需要提高眼界，將其放在人們的福祉上那麼生命健康和醫療照護就能變成讓生命更美好而不是比較不恐怖", "en": "So, if teasing unnecessary suffering outof the system was our first design cue, then tending to dignityby way of the senses, by way of the body --the aesthetic realm -- is design cue number two. Now this gets us quickly to the thirdand final bit for today; namely, we need to lift our sights,to set our sights on well-being, so that life and health and healthcare can become about making lifemore wonderful, rather than just less horrible."}, {"zh-tw": "一種慈善這會是以疾病為核心和以人為核心兩種醫療模式之間的區別也會讓醫療變成一種有創意、有生產力甚至好玩的實踐", "en": "Beneficence. Here, this gets right at the distinction between a disease-centered and a patient-or human-centered model of care, and here is where caringbecomes a creative, generative, even playful act."}, {"zh-tw": "「玩」這個聽起來像個有趣的詞語但它也是適應的一種最高境界", "en": "\"Play\" may sound like a funny word here. But it is also one of ourhighest forms of adaptation."}, {"zh-tw": "想想人類所有不可或缺的創作成果我們對食物的需求催生了料理", "en": "Consider every major compulsory effortit takes to be human. The need for food has birthed cuisine."}, {"zh-tw": "對遮風避雨的需求造成了建築對遮蔽身體的需求帶來時尚", "en": "The need for shelterhas given rise to architecture. The need for cover, fashion."}, {"zh-tw": "而因為備受時間的摧殘我們發明了音樂所以，既然死亡是生命中必然的部分我們能為它創造什麼呢?我所謂「好玩」，並不是建議我們選個輕快有趣的方式死亡或是指定某種特定的死亡方式", "en": "And for being subjected to the clock, well, we invented music. So, since dyingis a necessary part of life, what might we create with this fact? By \"play\" I am in no way suggestingwe take a light approach to dying or that we mandateany particular way of dying."}, {"zh-tw": "有許多的悲傷是我們無法挪走的無倫如何，我們都得向它屈服相反地，我是希望大家給它一點空間 --實體和心靈上的空間，讓生命可以自己一路享受到最後而不是就這樣被拖離老化和臨終可以變成一段漸強直至高潮的旋律", "en": "There are mountains of sorrowthat cannot move, and one way or another,we will all kneel there. Rather, I am asking that we make space -- physical, psychic room, to allow lifeto play itself all the way out -- so that rather than justgetting out of the way, aging and dying can becomea process of crescendo through to the end."}, {"zh-tw": "我們無法終結死亡我知道你們有些人正在嘗試", "en": "We can't solve for death. I know some of you are working on this."}, {"zh-tw": "但這麼做的同時，我們還可以--我們還是可以針對死亡進行設計早些年，部分的我已經死去--不管怎樣，我們都可以這麼說--", "en": "Meanwhile, we can -- We can design towards it. Parts of me died early on, and that's something we can all sayone way or another."}, {"zh-tw": "而我需要針對這個事實重新設計我的生命告訴你們，那是個解放當你意識到，你永遠能在留下的生命裡找到美好事物與意義的驚喜就像那顆雪球存在的完美時刻還有整個它融化的時刻如果我們能熱愛這樣的時刻或許我們就能學會活得精彩--不是無視死亡所以活得精采而是因為死亡而活得精彩", "en": "I got to redesign my lifearound this fact, and I tell you it has been a liberation to realize you can always finda shock of beauty or meaning in what life you have left, like that snowball lastingfor a perfect moment, all the while melting away. If we love such moments ferociously, then maybe we can learn to live well -- not in spite of death, but because of it."}, {"zh-tw": "讓死亡成為可以引領我們而非不去想像的東西謝謝各位", "en": "Let death be what takes us, not lack of imagination. Thank you."}], "title": "Bj Miller What Really Matters At The End Of Life"}
