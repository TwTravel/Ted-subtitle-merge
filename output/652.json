If I had not grown up in Nigeria, and if all I knew about Africawere from popular images, I too would think that Africawas a place of beautiful landscapes, beautiful animals, and incomprehensible people, fighting senseless wars,dying of poverty and AIDS, unable to speak for themselves and waiting to be savedby a kind, white foreigner.", "zh-tw": "但聽到大家把非洲當成一個國家時我還是會有點生氣。最近一次，就是在兩天前拉哥斯起飛的班機上這趟旅行近乎完美就差在維京航空的機上廣播關於「印度、非洲、和其他國家」的慈善工作在美國當了幾年的非洲人之後我漸漸了解我室友的反應。如果我不是在奈及利亞長大，我所認識的非洲就會是普遍的形象，我也會認為非洲充滿了漂亮的風景、美麗的動物和野蠻人打著沒意義的仗、死於貧窮與愛滋沒有思想等待好心的白人來拯救我們"}, {"en": "I would see Africansin the same way that I, as a child, had seen Fide's family.

But what is important about his writing is that it represents the beginning of a tradition of tellingAfrican stories in the West: A tradition of Sub-Saharan Africaas a place of negatives, of difference, of darkness, of people who, in the wordsof the wonderful poet Rudyard Kipling, are \"half devil, half child.\" And so, I began to realizethat my American roommate must have throughout her life seen and heard different versionsof this single story, as had a professor, who once told me that my novelwas not \"authentically African.\" Now, I was quite willing to contend that there were a number of thingswrong with the novel, that it had failed in a number of places, but I had not quite imaginedthat it had failed at achieving somethingcalled African authenticity.", "zh-tw": "大家也一定很欽佩約翰洛克的想像力。但最重要的是，他寫的東西開始了西方人眼中傳統的非洲印象一種次撒哈拉非洲的負面印象是和他們不同且黑暗的印象，住著一群，我引用詩人羅德雅．吉百齡所寫的「半是惡魔，半是人」我漸漸了解我美國室友的想法她的一生一定聽過各種版本的單一故事，就如有位教授曾告訴我，我的小說描寫的不是「真正的非洲」。我願意承認小說裡有些錯誤的地方，不夠好的部份，但我很難想像我的小說沒有傳達「真正的非洲」。"}, {"en": "In fact, I did not knowwhat African authenticity was. The professor told me that my characterswere too much like him, an educated and middle-class man.", "zh-tw": "而事實上我不曉得什麼叫「真正的非洲」。那位教授說，我書中的角色太像他了受教育、中產階級。"}, {"en": "My characters drove cars. They were not starving.", "zh-tw": "我筆下的角色開車沒有餓肚子"}, {"en": "Therefore they were notauthentically African. But I must quickly addthat I too am just as guilty in the question of the single story.", "zh-tw": "所以他們不是真正的非洲人。但我也要馬上承認我自己對別人也犯過單一故事的錯。"}, {"en": "A few years ago,I visited Mexico from the U.S. The political climate in the U.S.at the time was tense, and there were debates going onabout immigration.", "zh-tw": "幾年前，我到墨西哥當時美國的政治情況有點緊張大家都在吵移民話題。"}, {"en": "And, as often happens in America, immigration becamesynonymous with Mexicans. There were endless stories of Mexicans as people who werefleecing the healthcare system, sneaking across the border, being arrested at the border,that sort of thing.", "zh-tw": "在美國就會常常聽到移民等同於墨西哥人這一類的話。還有一堆關於墨西哥人的故事說他們是如何鑽醫療系統的漏洞從邊境溜進來在邊界被逮捕之類的事。"}, {"en": "I remember walking aroundon my first day in Guadalajara, watching the people going to work, rolling up tortillas in the marketplace, smoking, laughing. I remember first feeling slight surprise.", "zh-tw": "我就記得第一天在瓜達拉哈拉逛街時看著工作的人們，市場裡有人做西班牙蛋餅抽菸、大笑。我記得我當時有點吃驚"}, {"en": "And then, I was overwhelmed with shame. I realized that I had been so immersedin the media coverage of Mexicans that they had become one thing in my mind, the abject immigrant.", "zh-tw": "隨後感到非常丟臉我發現自己完全相信媒體所報導的墨西哥人以至於他們在我心中的形象就是卑鄙的移民。"}, {"en": "I had bought intothe single story of Mexicans and I could not havebeen more ashamed of myself. So that is how to create a single story, show a people as one thing, as only one thing, over and over again, and that is what they become.", "zh-tw": "我也曾對墨西哥有單一故事我也實在感到很羞恥。單一故事的產生就是以同一種方式描述同一種人一遍又一遍，最後他們就會變成那樣。"}, {"en": "It is impossible to talkabout the single story without talking about power. There is a word, an Igbo word, that I think about whenever I think aboutthe power structures of the world, and it is \"nkali.\" It's a noun that loosely translatesto \"to be greater than another.\" Like our economic and political worlds, stories too are definedby the principle of nkali: How they are told, who tells them, when they're told,how many stories are told, are really dependent on power.", "zh-tw": "講到單一故事就不能不講權力我想到權力就會想到伊博語裡的一個字有關世界上的權力結構的 「nkali」是個名詞，大概翻譯是「比其他人更厲害」而就像談到經濟與政治一樣故事也是建立在「nkali」的原則上故事如何傳遞、誰來傳遞，什麼時候、多少次都是由權力控制的。"}, {"en": "Power is the ability not just to tellthe story of another person, but to make it the definitivestory of that person. The Palestinian poetMourid Barghouti writes that if you want to dispossess a people, the simplest way to do itis to tell their story and to start with, \"secondly.\" Start the story with the arrowsof the Native Americans, and not with the arrival of the British, and you have an entirely different story.", "zh-tw": "權力不只能述說故事還能創造決定性的故事。巴勒斯坦詩人穆里‧巴爾古提曾說如果你想剝奪一個人的身分，最簡單的方法就是說故事而且從「第二點」開頭。所以講美國印地安人的故事時，先講他們的箭而不是英國殖民就會有全然不同的故事。"}, {"en": "Start the story withthe failure of the African state, and not with the colonialcreation of the African state, and you have an entirely different story. I recently spoke at a university where a student told methat it was such a shame that Nigerian men were physical abusers like the father character in my novel.", "zh-tw": "先講非洲各國失敗的故事而不是被殖民的部份就會有全然不同的故事。我最近到一所大學演講有個學生告訴我真是可恥奈及利亞的男人都很暴力就像我小說中的父親一樣"}, {"en": "I told him that I had just read a novelcalled \"American Psycho\" -- -- and that it was such a shame that young Americanswere serial murderers. Now, obviously I said thisin a fit of mild irritation.", "zh-tw": "我告訴他，我最近看了一本小說書名是《美國殺人魔 》真是可恥美國年輕人都是殺人魔當時我實在有點不悅"}, {"en": "But it would never haveoccurred to me to think that just because I had read a novelin which a character was a serial killer that he was somehowrepresentative of all Americans. This is not because I ama better person than that student, but because of America's culturaland economic power, I had many stories of America.", "zh-tw": "我從沒有因為我讀了一本關於連續殺人魔的小說我就認為所有美國人都是殺人魔當然不是因為我比那個學生好而是因為美國的文化、經濟地位所以我對美國有多重故事"}, {"en": "I had read Tyler and Updikeand Steinbeck and Gaitskill. I did not have a single story of America.", "zh-tw": "我讀Tyler、Updike、Steinbeck、Gaitskill的書對美國，我沒有單一故事。"}, {"en": "When I learned, some years ago, that writers were expectedto have had really unhappy childhoods to be successful, I began to think about how I could inventhorrible things my parents had done to me.

The consequenceof the single story is this: It robs people of dignity.", "zh-tw": "我總覺得要完全的了解一個地方或是一個人不去了解全部的故事，是不可能的。述說單一故事的後果是人們的尊嚴被奪去"}, {"en": "It makes our recognitionof our equal humanity difficult.
