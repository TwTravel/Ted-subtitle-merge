I kicked it off with a guessabout South Africa, which wasn't exactlyaccording to the rules because South Africa's not my country. But alluding to the country'scontinual attempts to build a postracial society after being ravagedfor decades by apartheid, I tweeted, #ifafricawasabar South Africawould be drinking all kinds of alcohol and begging themto get along in its stomach."}, {"zh-tw": "然後我就等著。然後我有一種奇怪的感覺，懷疑自己是不是有點超過。", "en": "And then I waited. And then I had that funny feelingwhere I wondered if I crossed the line."}, {"zh-tw": "所以我又推了幾個訊息，講我自己的國家，以及其它幾個我熟悉的非洲國家。然後我再繼續等，但是這次，我幾乎把我推過的每一則訊息都讀一遍，來說服我自己，不對，是提醒我自己我有多幽默，如果沒人看得懂，那就算了。", "en": "So, I sent out a few other tweetsabout my own country and a few other African countriesI'm familiar with. And then I waited again, but this time I read through almost every tweetI had ever tweeted to convince myself, no, to remind myself that I'm really funny and that if nobody gets it, that's fine."}, {"zh-tw": "但是幸好，我不需要自我解嘲太久。很快，大家就開始加入。", "en": "But luckily, I didn't have to do that for very long. Very soon, people were participating."}, {"zh-tw": "事實上，在七月的那週結束時，推特標籤「#如果非洲是間酒吧」就收到了將近六萬則訊息，整片大陸如醉如痴，並且開始在全世界的出版品上出現。大家拿這個標籤做很多不同的事。", "en": "In fact, by the end of that week in July, the hashtag #ifafricawasabar would have garnered around 60,000 tweets, lit up the continent and made its way to publicationsall over the world. People were using the hashtagto do many different things."}, {"zh-tw": "有的拿來取笑他們的刻板印象：「#如果非洲是間酒吧，奈及利亞會站在外面解釋他會付入場費，反正只要知道保鏢的銀行帳戶。」（諷刺詐騙集團）有的拿來批評政府支出：「#如果非洲是間酒吧，南非會訂購叫不出名字的瓶裝水，開無法支付的水站。」有的拿來蔑視地緣政治的緊張關係：「#如果非洲是間酒吧，南蘇丹會是那個有嚴重憤怒管理問題的新傢伙。」有的拿來提醒我們即使在非洲，還是有我們不知道的國家存在：「#如果非洲是間酒吧，賴索托就是那個沒有人真的認識，但老是出現在照片裡的人。」還有拿來取笑那些自認不在非洲的國家：「#如果非洲是間酒吧，埃及、利比亞及摩洛哥大概會說：『搞什麼鬼，我們在這裡幹嘛？』」有的提到轉變很大的國家：「#如果非洲是間酒吧，盧安達會是那個進來時沒半毛錢、沒車的女孩，但離開時開心、有錢、醉茫茫。」但最重要的，大家用這個標籤來連結。大家用「非洲情」來連結。", "en": "To poke fun at their stereotypes: [#IfAfricaWasABarNigeria would be outside explaining that he will pay the entrance fee, all he needs isthe bouncer's account details.] To criticize government spending: [#ifafricawasabar South Africa would beordering bottles it can't pronounce running a tab it won't be able to pay] To make light of geopolitical tensions: [#IfAfricaWasABarSouth Sudan would be the new guy with serious anger management issues.] To remind us that even in Africa there are some countrieswe don't know exist: [#IfAfricaWasABarLesotho would be that person who nobody really knowsbut is always in the pictures.] And also to make fun of the countriesthat don't think that they're in Africa: [#IfAfricaWasABar Egypt, Libya,Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco be like \"What the hellare we doing here?!!\"] And to note the countriesthat had made a big turnaround: [#ifAfricawasabarRwanda would be that girl that comes with no money and no transportbut leaves drunk, happy and rich] But most importantly, people were using the hashtag to connect. People were connectingover their Africanness."}, {"zh-tw": "所以七月的某一週，推特真的成了一間非洲酒吧。我激動得不得了，主要是因為我意識到泛非洲主義可以行得通，在我們面前、我們之間、我們的指尖上，存在著一個平臺，只要星星之火，就可以燎起彼此的渴望。", "en": "So for one week in July, Twitter became a real African bar. And I was really thrilled, mainly because I realizedthat Pan-Africanism could work, that we had before us,between us, at our fingertips a platform that just needed a small spark to light in us a hunger for each other."}, {"zh-tw": "我的名字是希妍妲·莫瑚茨娃，我 22 歲，我是泛非洲人出身。我說我是泛非洲人出身，因為我的父母來自非洲兩個不同的國家。", "en": "My name is Siyanda Mohutsiwa, I'm 22 years old and I am Pan-Africanist by birth. Now, I say I'm Pan-Africanist by birth because my parents arefrom two different African countries."}, {"zh-tw": "我的父親來自非洲南部一個叫波札那的國家。只比德國大一點點。", "en": "My father's from a countrycalled Botswana in southern Africa. It's only slightly bigger than Germany."}, {"zh-tw": "今年我們慶祝國家邁入穩定民主 50 年，而且我們的社會政策也非常先進。", "en": "This year we celebrateour 50th year of stable democracy. And it has some very progressivesocial policies."}, {"zh-tw": "我的母親來自史瓦濟蘭王國。它是個非常非常小的國家，也在非洲南部。", "en": "My mother's countryis the Kingdom of Swaziland. It's a very, very small country,also in southern Africa."}, {"zh-tw": "它是非洲最後一個君主專制國。被君王及王室統治，實施他們傳統的王室繼承法好長一段時間。", "en": "It is Africa's last complete monarchy. So it's been ruled by a kingand a royal family in line with their tradition, for a very long time."}, {"zh-tw": "理論上看這兩個國家似乎非常不一樣。在我小時候，我還看得到不同點。", "en": "On paper, these countriesseem very different. And when I was a kid,I could see the difference."}, {"zh-tw": "一個國家下很多雨，另一個國家沒下那麼多雨。但是除此之外，我其實並不了解我的父母來自不同的國家有什麼大不了。", "en": "It rained a lot in one country,it didn't rain quite as much in the other. But outside of that,I didn't really realize why it mattered that my parentswere from two different places."}, {"zh-tw": "但是時間流逝，它對我產生非常特別的影響。你知道嗎，我在一個國家出生，卻在另一個國家成長。", "en": "But it would go onto have a very peculiar effect on me. You see, I was born in one country and raised in the other."}, {"zh-tw": "我們搬到波札那時，我還在學步，說一口流利的史瓦濟語，其它的都不會。所以我在開始接觸我的新家，我的新文化認同時，完全是個外人，無法理解人家告訴我的任何事，即使這個家庭及國家的傳統是我即將加入的。", "en": "When we moved to Botswana, I was a toddler who spoke fluent SiSwati and nothing else. So I was being introduced to my new home, my new cultural identity, as a complete outsider, incapable of comprehendinganything that was being said to me by the family and country whose traditionsI was meant to move forward."}, {"zh-tw": "但我很快就丟了史瓦濟語。而且我回史瓦濟蘭時，我不斷注意到自己變得有多麼不像史瓦濟蘭人。", "en": "But very soon, I would shed SiSwati. And when I would go back to Swaziland, I would be constantly confrontedby how very non-Swazi I was becoming."}, {"zh-tw": "再加上我進入非洲的私立學校系統，它全部的目的就是要把你「去非洲化」，而且我有一段非常特殊的青春期。但是我想我對身分認同的概念產生興趣就是從這裡開始，在一個很奇怪的十字路口上，同時歸屬於兩個地方，卻又對兩邊都沒有真正的歸屬感，同時存在於這片無際的交錯環繞空間裡。", "en": "Add to that my entryinto Africa's private school system, whose entire purposeis to beat the Africanness out of you, and I would havea very peculiar adolescence. But I think that my interestin ideas of identity was born here, in the strange intersectionof belonging to two places at once but not really belongingto either one very well and belonging to this vast spacein between and around simultaneously."}, {"zh-tw": "我開始迷上共享非洲身分這個想法。從那時候開始，我一直在讀有關政治、地理、身分認同及這一切意義的文章。", "en": "I became obsessed with the ideaof a shared African identity. Since then, I have continuedto read about politics and geography and identityand what all those things mean."}, {"zh-tw": "我也一直對非洲哲學抱持深切的好奇心。我開始讀的時候，我深受黑人知識份子文章的吸引，像南非的史蒂芬·比科及法國的法蘭茲·法農，他們著手在複雜的觀念，如去殖民化及黑人的意識問題。", "en": "I've also held on to a deep curiosityabout African philosophies. When I began to read, I gravitated towards the worksof black intellectuals like Steve Biko and Frantz Fanon, who tackled complex ideas like decolonizationand black consciousness."}, {"zh-tw": "在我 14 歲，認為自己已經消化了這些偉大的想法後，我就進一步去看非洲政治代表人物的演講，像是布吉納法索的托馬斯·桑卡拉，及剛果的帕特里斯·盧蒙巴。我讀每一本我拿得到的非洲小說。", "en": "And when I thought, at 14,that I had digested these grand ideas, I moved on to the speechesof iconic African statesmen like Burkina Faso's Thomas Sankara and Congo's Patrice Lumumba. I read every piece of African fictionthat I could get my hands on."}, {"zh-tw": "所以當推特出現時，我以青少女的熱情一踴躍上這班列車，因為我的朋友都被我這些無關緊要的話題搞到無聊到爆。那是 2011 年，整個非洲南部及整片大陸上，平價的智慧型手機上網方案及網路瀏覽變得更容易取得。", "en": "So when Twitter came, I hopped on with the enthusiasmof a teenage girl whose friends are super, super boredof hearing about all this random stuff. The year was 2011 and all over southern Africaand the whole continent, affordable data packagesfor smartphones and Internet surfing became much easier to get."}, {"zh-tw": "所以我這個世代，我們都用這種平臺彼此送簡訊，你只需要 140 個字及一點點創意。在去上班的漫長路途上、在我們應該注意聽講的課堂上、在午休時間，我們都盡可能多通訊，聊著非洲青年的現實生活。", "en": "So my generation, we were sendingmessages to each other on this platform that just needed 140 charactersand a little bit of creativity. On long commutes to work, in lectures that some of usshould have been paying attention to, on our lunch breaks, we would communicate as much as we could about the everyday realitiesof being young and African."}, {"zh-tw": "但是當然，不是每一個人都享受得到這種奢華。所以這意味著如果你是波札那的青少女，而且你想在網路上玩得開心，一，你得用英文發訊息。", "en": "But of course, this luxurywas not available to everybody. So this meant that if you werea teenage girl in Botswana and you wantedto have fun on the Internet, one, you had to tweet in English."}, {"zh-tw": "二，除了你在網上認識的那三個人，你得跟隨更多帳號，你得跟隨南非人、辛巴威人迦納人、奈及利亞人。", "en": "Two, you had to follow more than justthe three other people you knew online. You had to follow South Africans,Zimbabweans, Ghanaians, Nigerians."}, {"zh-tw": "忽然間，你的整個世界大大開展。我的世界的確開展了。", "en": "And suddenly, your whole world opened up. And my whole world did open up."}, {"zh-tw": "我跟隨了幾個活躍的非洲人，他們在整片大陸上旅行，常常拍自己的相片，還貼出來，標上「#我的非洲」標籤。因為當時，如果你在推特或 Google，或在任何一種社群媒體上搜尋非洲，你會以為整個非洲大陸就是動物的照片，及白人在飯店渡假村喝雞尾酒。", "en": "I followed vibrant Africanswho were travelling around the continent, taking pictures of themselves and posting themunder the hashtag #myafrica. Because at that time, if you were to search Africaon Twitter or on Google or any kind of social media, you would think that the entire continentwas just pictures of animals and white guys drinking cocktailsin hotel resorts."}, {"zh-tw": "但是非洲人用這種平臺取回觀光部分某種程度的所有權。是非洲人在奈及利亞的海灘上自拍。", "en": "But Africans were using this platform to take some kind of ownershipof the tourism sectors. It was Africans taking selfieson the beaches of Nigeria."}, {"zh-tw": "是非洲人在奈洛比的酒吧裡喝雞尾酒。他們就是我在環遊大陸的旅程中。開始遇到的同一批非洲人，", "en": "It was Africansin cocktail bars in Nairobi. And these were the same Africansthat I began to meet in my own travels around the continent."}, {"zh-tw": "我們會討論非洲文學、政治、經濟政策。但是幾乎無一例外，每一次我們最後都會討論推特。", "en": "We would discuss African literature,politics, economic policy. But almost invariably, every single time, we would end up discussing Twitter."}, {"zh-tw": "那也是我明白這代表什麼意義的時刻。我們正站在奇妙的東西之中，因為這是第一次非洲青年能夠即時討論自己大陸的未來，沒有邊界、財務及政府監控的限制。", "en": "And that's when I realized what this was. We were standing in the middleof something amazing, because for the first time ever young Africans could discussthe future of our continent in real time, without the restriction of borders,finances and watchful governments."}, {"zh-tw": "因為鮮為人知的事實是許多非洲人對其它非洲國家所知極少，甚至比西方人對非洲整體的了解還少。這是意外造成的，但是有時候也是刻意的。", "en": "Because the little known truth is many Africans know a lot lessabout other African countries than some Westernersmight know about Africa as a whole. This is by accident, but sometimes, it's by design."}, {"zh-tw": "譬如在種族隔離的南非，黑人會不斷被疲勞轟炸，說任何一個黑人統治的國家都注定要失敗。這麼做是為了說服他們被白人壓倒性統治，會比生活在一個全黑又自由的國家要好得多。", "en": "For example, in apartheid South Africa, black South Africanswere constantly being bombarded with this message that any countryruled by black people was destined for failure. And this was done to convince them that they were much better offunder crushing white rule than they were livingin a black and free nation."}, {"zh-tw": "再加上非洲的殖民式、古老的教育體制，自 1920 年代不假思索地沿用至今——在 15 歲時，我就可以說出所有過去 200 年中歐洲發生過的戰爭的各種起因，但是我無法說出鄰國總統的名字。對我而言，這一點道理都沒有，因為無論我們喜歡與否，非洲人民的命運都深深交織在一起。", "en": "Add to that Africa's colonial,archaic education system, which has been unthinkinglycarried over from the 1920s -- and at the age of 15,I could name all the various causes of the wars that had happenedin Europe in the past 200 years, but I couldn't name the presidentof my neighboring country. And to me, this doesn't make any sense because whether we like it or not, the fates of African peopleare deeply intertwined."}, {"zh-tw": "災難來臨，時局動盪時，我們同當後果。在蒲隆地人逃離政治動亂時，他們逃向我們，逃向其它非洲國家。", "en": "When disaster hits, when turmoil hits, we share the consequences. When Burundians flee political turmoil, they go to us, to other African countries."}, {"zh-tw": "非洲有六個世界上最大的難民中心。曾經只是蒲隆地人的問題，現在變成非洲人的問題。", "en": "Africa has six of the world'slargest refugee centers. What was once a Burundian problem becomes an African problem."}, {"zh-tw": "所以對我而言，沒有蘇丹人的問題，或南非人的問題，或肯亞人的問題，只有非洲人的問題，因為最終，我們共同擔當動亂。所以如果我們可以有難同當，為什麼我們不能也有福同享？要怎麼做呢？長遠來看，我們可以朝增加非洲內的貿易邁進，消除邊界及對領袖施壓，以落實他們已經簽署的區域協定。", "en": "So to me, there are no Sudanese problems or South African problemsor Kenyan problems, only African problems because eventually, we share the turmoil. So if we share the problems, why aren't we doing a better jobof sharing the successes? How can we do that? Well, in the long term, we can shoot towardsincreasing inter-African trade, removing bordersand putting pressure on leaders to fulfill regional agreementsthey've already signed."}, {"zh-tw": "但是我認為非洲要同享成功最大的方法，是促進我所謂社群泛非洲主義。現在，政治泛非洲主義已經存在，所以我沒有發明什麼全新的東西。", "en": "But I think that the biggest wayfor Africa to share its successes is to foster somethingI like to call social Pan-Africanism. Now, political Pan-Africanismalready exists, so I'm not inventing anythingtotally new here."}, {"zh-tw": "但是政治的泛非洲主義通常是指非洲政治菁英的聯合。這樣是誰得到好處？嗯，幾乎完全是非洲領袖。", "en": "But political Pan-Africanism is usually the African unityof the political elite. And who does that benefit? Well, African leaders, almost exclusively."}, {"zh-tw": "不是這樣的，我在說的是普通非洲人的泛非洲主義。像我這樣的非洲青年，我們充滿了創意能量，創新思想。", "en": "No, what I'm talking about is the Pan-Africanismof the ordinary African. Young Africans like me, we are bursting with creative energy, with innovative ideas."}, {"zh-tw": "但是有不好的政府與不穩定的機構，所有的潛能終將成為浪費。在這片大陸，大多數政要掌權的時間，都超過大多數人口的壽命，我們迫切需要新的東西，能行得通的東西。", "en": "But with bad governanceand shaky institutions, all of this potential could go to waste. On a continent where morethan a handful of leaders have been in power longer than the majorityof the populations has been alive, we are in desperate need of something new, something that works."}, {"zh-tw": "我認為那個東西就是社群泛非主義。我的夢想是非洲青年不再允許邊界與環境窒礙我們的創新。", "en": "And I think that thingis social Pan-Africanism. My dream is that young Africans stop allowing borders and circumstanceto suffocate our innovation."}, {"zh-tw": "我的夢想是當一名非洲青年想出了絕妙的東西，他們不會說：「唉，這在我的國家行不通，」然後放棄。我的夢想是非洲青年開始了解整片大陸都是我們的畫布，是我們的家。", "en": "My dream is that when a young Africancomes up with something brilliant, they don't say, \"Well,this wouldn't work in my country,\" and then give up. My dream is that young Africansbegin to realize that the entire continentis our canvas, is our home."}, {"zh-tw": "透過網路，我們可以開始集體思考，我們可以開始一同創新。在非洲，我們說，如果你想走得快，就要一個人走。但是如果你想走得遠，你就要跟人一起走。我相信社群泛非主義就是我們一起走遠的方式。", "en": "Using the Internet,we can begin to think collaboratively, we can begin to innovate together. In Africa, we say,\"If you want to go fast, you go alone, but if you want to go far,you go together.\" And I believe that social Pan-Africanismis how we can go far together."}, {"zh-tw": "這已經發生了。使用這些社群網路，讓非洲青年取得一直只能用暴力奪取的東西：聲音。", "en": "And this is already happening. Access to these online networkshas given young Africans something we've alwayshad to violently take: a voice."}, {"zh-tw": "我們現在有平臺。在這之前，如果你想要聽非洲青年的心聲，你要等 65 歲的青年團契牧師一早醒來，吞下他的胃灼熱藥，然後告訴你他對你這個世代未來 20 年的計畫。", "en": "We now have a platform. Before now, if you wantedto hear from the youth in Africa, you waited for the 65-year-oldminister of youth -- to wake up in the morning, take his heartburn medication and then tell you the planshe has for your generation in 20 years time."}, {"zh-tw": "在這之前，如果你想讓非常可能是專政的政府聽到你的心聲，你會被迫走上街頭抗議，承擔後果，並祈求好運，某處的西方世界報紙或許會打動某些人。但是現在我們有機會支持彼此，用從所未見的方式做到。", "en": "Before now, if you wanted to be heardby your possibly tyrannical government, you were pushed to protest,suffer the consequences and have your fingers crossed that some Western paper somewheremight make someone care. But now we have opportunitiesto back each other up in ways we never could before."}, {"zh-tw": "我們支持南非學生上街頭抗議高得離譜的高等教育學費。我們支持遊行到議會的辛巴威婦女。", "en": "We support South African students who are marching againstridiculously high tertiary fees. We support Zimbabwean womenwho are marching to parliament."}, {"zh-tw": "我們支持被非法拘禁的安哥拉記者。這是第一次，非洲的痛苦與非洲的抱負可以被最能感同身受的人見證：其他非洲人。", "en": "We support Angolan journalistswho are being illegally detained. For the first time ever, African pain and African aspiration has the ability to be witnessed by those who can empathizewith it the most: other Africans."}, {"zh-tw": "我相信藉著社群泛非主義的想法，並使用網路當工具，我們可以開始拯救彼此，而最終，拯救我們自己。謝謝！", "en": "I believe that witha social Pan-Africanist thinking and using the Internet as a tool, we can begin to rescue each other, and ultimately, to rescue ourselves. Thank you."}], "title": "Siyanda Mohutsiwa How Young Africans Found A Voice On Twitter"}
