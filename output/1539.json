Long before that I had grown up with the war, but alongside weekend sleepovers and Saturday soccer games and fistfights with racist children of the Confederacy and religio-nationalist demonstrations chanting, \"Down with communism and long live Afghanistan,\" and burning effigies of Brezhnev before I even knew what it meant."}, {"zh-tw": "不過這就是地理所本身因此我今天站在這裡流著阿富汗的血,以及上帝授予我的鄉土作風一個無神論者和一個激進的政治藝術傢並且在過去九年一直在", "en": "But this is the geography of self.
