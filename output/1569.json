But before I give it away,I want to ask you to right now do a little audit of your bodyand what you're doing with your body."}, {"zh-tw": "你們之中有多少人身體是約略縮小的?或許你現在翹著腳駝著背?或者雙手抱膝有時我們會這樣抱著手臂", "en": "So how many of you aresort of making yourselves smaller? Maybe you're hunching, crossing your legs,maybe wrapping your ankles. Sometimes we hold onto our arms like this."}, {"zh-tw": "有時我們會打開雙手我看到囉", "en": "Sometimes we spread out. I see you."}, {"zh-tw": "現在請大家專心在自己身上我們等一下在回到這件事上希望你們可以稍微改變一下這會讓你的生活變得很不一樣", "en": "So I want you to pay attentionto what you're doing right now. We're going to come backto that in a few minutes, and I'm hoping that if you learnto tweak this a little bit, it could significantly changethe way your life unfolds."}, {"zh-tw": "所以，我們深為身體語言著迷特別是別人的身體語言你知道，當我們為尷尬的互動，或微笑或輕蔑的一瞥，或不自然的眨眼甚至是握手這樣的一件事", "en": "So, we're really fascinatedwith body language, and we're particularly interestedin other people's body language. You know, we're interested in,like, you know —  — an awkward interaction, or a smile, or a contemptuous glance,or maybe a very awkward wink, or maybe even something like a handshake."}, {"zh-tw": "（影片旁白）：他們抵達英國首相官邸唐寧街10號，幸運的警員可以和美國總統握手噢，還有", "en": "Narrator: Here they arearriving at Number 10. This lucky policeman gets to shake handswith the President of the United States."}, {"zh-tw": "來自....的首相? 不所以一個握手，或不握手我們都可以聊上好幾個禮拜", "en": "Here comes the Prime Minister --No. Amy Cuddy: So a handshake,or the lack of a handshake, can have us talking for weeksand weeks and weeks."}, {"zh-tw": "即使 BBC 和紐約時報也不例外我們說到非語言行為或身體語言時我們社會科學學者將之歸類為非口語語言它就是一種語言，所以我們會想到溝通", "en": "Even the BBC and The New York Times. So obviously when we thinkabout nonverbal behavior, or body language -- but we call itnonverbals as social scientists -- it's language, so we thinkabout communication."}, {"zh-tw": "當我們想到溝通，我們就想到互動所以你現在的身體語言正在告訴我甚麼?我的身體又是在傳達甚麼給你們?有很多理由讓我們相信這是有效的切入點社會科學家花了很多時間", "en": "When we think about communication,we think about interactions. So what is your body languagecommunicating to me? What's mine communicating to you? And there's a lot of reason to believethat this is a valid way to look at this."}, {"zh-tw": "研究我們的身體語言或其他人的身體語言在判斷方面的效應而我們根據他人的身體語言，推論並做出快速又決絕的判斷", "en": "So social scientistshave spent a lot of time looking at the effectsof our body language, or other people's body language,on judgments. And we make sweeping judgmentsand inferences from body language."}, {"zh-tw": "這些判斷可以幫我們預測生命裡很有意義的事件像是要雇用誰，邀請誰出去約會舉例而言，Tufts 大學的研究員，Nalini Ambady讓我們看到 當人們觀賞一段 30 秒正牌醫師和病人互動的無聲影片他們對該醫師是否和善的觀感可用來預測該醫師日後是否會被病人告上法庭", "en": "And those judgments can predictreally meaningful life outcomes like who we hire or promote,who we ask out on a date. For example, Nalini Ambady,a researcher at Tufts University, shows that when people watch30-second soundless clips of real physician-patient interactions, their judgmentsof the physician's niceness predict whether or notthat physician will be sued."}, {"zh-tw": "跟這個醫師稱職與否沒有太大關係重點是我們喜不喜歡他和他們互動的情形?更戲劇化的是，普林斯頓的 Alex Todorov 的研究告訴我們我們在一秒內對政治人物臉部的喜好判斷對美國參議院和美國州長的選舉結果有 70% 的預測力甚至，在電腦上的互動在線上協商時，妥善運用表情符號可以讓你在協商中獲的較多價值假如你運用不得當，不妙！對吧?當我們想到非口語語言，我們就想到判斷別人別人如何判斷我們以及結果", "en": "So it doesn't have to do so much with whether or not that physicianwas incompetent, but do we like that personand how they interacted? Even more dramatic,Alex Todorov at Princeton has shown us that judgmentsof political candidates' faces in just one second predict 70 percent of U.S. Senate and gubernatorialrace outcomes, and even, let's go digital, emoticons used well in online negotiations can lead you to claim more valuefrom that negotiation. If you use them poorly, bad idea. Right? So when we think of nonverbals,we think of how we judge others, how they judge usand what the outcomes are."}, {"zh-tw": "我們往往忘記，還有其他人也受到我們非口語語言影響那就是我們自己我們也同時受自己的非口語語言、想法感覺和生理影響", "en": "We tend to forget, though,the other audience that's influenced by our nonverbals,and that's ourselves. We are also influenced by our nonverbals, our thoughts and our feelingsand our physiology."}, {"zh-tw": "所以我說的究竟是甚麼樣的非口語語言?我是一位社會心理學家，我研究偏見我在一所競爭激烈的商學院教書因此無可避免地對權力間互動關係著迷特別是在非口語語言表達方面的權力和支配", "en": "So what nonverbals am I talking about? I'm a social psychologist.I study prejudice, and I teach at a competitivebusiness school, so it was inevitable that I would becomeinterested in power dynamics. I became especially interestedin nonverbal expressions of power and dominance."}, {"zh-tw": "展示權力和支配的非口語語言又為何呢?嗯，讓我細細道來在動物世界裡，權力和支配的非口語語言講究擴展", "en": "And what are nonverbal expressionsof power and dominance? Well, this is what they are. So in the animal kingdom,they are about expanding."}, {"zh-tw": "所以你盡可能得把自己變大，你伸展身體占滿空間，基本上就是開展身體就是關於展開身體", "en": "So you make yourself big, you stretch out, you take up space,you're basically opening up. It's about opening up."}, {"zh-tw": "整個動物世界都是如此，不僅限於靈長類。", "en": "And this is trueacross the animal kingdom. It's not just limited to primates."}, {"zh-tw": "人類也幹同樣的事不論是習於權力的人或普通人偶而碰上可以大聲講話的時後，都是如此", "en": "And humans do the same thing. So they do this both when they havepower sort of chronically, and also when they're feelingpowerful in the moment."}, {"zh-tw": "特別有趣的原因是它讓我們明白古今世界權力的展現從來是如此地一致自尊的表現Jessica Tracy 研究顯示", "en": "And this one is especially interestingbecause it really shows us how universal and old theseexpressions of power are. This expression, which is known as pride, Jessica Tracy has studied."}, {"zh-tw": "視力正常的人和先天視障的人在贏得比賽時都做同樣的事當他們跨過終點線贏得比賽之際無論他們是否曾看過這種行為他們都展現這個姿勢", "en": "She shows that peoplewho are born with sight and people who are congenitallyblind do this when they win at a physical competition. So when they crossthe finish line and they've won, it doesn't matter if they've neverseen anyone do it."}, {"zh-tw": "雙臂呈V字型朝上，下巴微揚", "en": "They do this. So the arms up in the V,the chin is slightly lifted."}, {"zh-tw": "那我們感到無助的時候呢? 我們做完全相反的事我們縮起身體。我們把自己捲曲起來", "en": "What do we do when we feel powerless? We do exactly the opposite. We close up.We wrap ourselves up."}, {"zh-tw": "讓自己變得小一點，最好別碰到身旁的人", "en": "We make ourselves small. We don't want to bumpinto the person next to us."}, {"zh-tw": "我再重複一次，人類和動物都一樣這是在權力不對等時發生的狀況", "en": "So again, both animals and humansdo the same thing. And this is what happenswhen you put together high and low power."}, {"zh-tw": "在不對等權力狀態下，我們傾向和對方互補若有人對我們展現權力我們傾向把自己縮小些，我們不模仿他們", "en": "So what we tend todo when it comes to power is that we complementthe other's nonverbals. So if someone is beingreally powerful with us, we tend to make ourselves smaller.We don't mirror them."}, {"zh-tw": "我們背道而馳當我在課堂上觀察這麼現象時你猜我發現甚麼? 我發現 MBA 的學生把權力的非口語語言部分表達的淋漓盡致", "en": "We do the opposite of them. So I'm watching this behaviorin the classroom, and what do I notice? I notice that MBA students really exhibitthe full range of power nonverbals."}, {"zh-tw": "你會看到有些人就像動物群裡支配的雄性的變形上課前大搖大擺走進教室，一屁股坐在教室正中好像他們真的要占據整個空間似的當他們坐下的時候，身體會展開", "en": "So you have peoplewho are like caricatures of alphas, really coming into the room, they getright into the middle of the room before class even starts,like they really want to occupy space. When they sit down,they're sort of spread out."}, {"zh-tw": "舉手時會像這樣把手高舉起來有些人基本上是攤成一堆他們一走進來你就會發現", "en": "They raise their hands like this. You have other peoplewho are virtually collapsing when they come in.As soon they come in, you see it."}, {"zh-tw": "從他們的臉上表情和身體姿勢都看得出來他們坐在椅子上，把自己縮的小小的然後舉手的時候是這種畏畏縮縮的樣子我觀察到兩點：", "en": "You see it on their facesand their bodies, and they sit in their chairand they make themselves tiny, and they go like thiswhen they raise their hand. I notice a couple of things about this."}, {"zh-tw": "第一，不出所料這跟性別有關", "en": "One, you're not going to be surprised. It seems to be related to gender."}, {"zh-tw": "女人比男人更會顯得畏縮長期以來女人都不覺得像男人那麼強勢", "en": "So women are much more likelyto do this kind of thing than men. Women feel chronicallyless powerful than men, so this is not surprising."}, {"zh-tw": "所以這並不太讓人意外。但第二件我觀察到的這種表現似乎跟學生的參與程度與參與表現相關在 MBA 的課堂上來說這真的非常重要因為參與的表現占成績的一半", "en": "But the other thing I noticed is that it also seemedto be related to the extent to which the students were participating,and how well they were participating. And this is really importantin the MBA classroom, because participationcounts for half the grade."}, {"zh-tw": "所以商學院一直以來都為男女生在參與上的差別傷腦筋入學的時候男女生不分軒輊可是成績出來卻反映性別差異而看起來一部分原因和參與有關", "en": "So business schools have been strugglingwith this gender grade gap. You get these equally qualifiedwomen and men coming in and then you getthese differences in grades, and it seems to be partlyattributable to participation."}, {"zh-tw": "所以我開始思考，好吧所以這群人一開始來是這副樣子，看起來積極參與那是不是可能讓大家先假裝成那樣進而影響他們，能更積極參與?我在 Berkeley 的主要合作研究夥伴，Dana Carney和我都很想知道，是不是能先假裝，到最後則成真譬如說，先小小假裝一陣子，然後在實際行為上經驗到你看來很有權力的樣子的結果我們都知道非口語語言影響他人對我們的看法。已經有很多研究證明這件事", "en": "So I started to wonder, you know, okay, so you have these people coming inlike this, and they're participating. Is it possible that we couldget people to fake it and would it lead themto participate more? So my main collaboratorDana Carney, who's at Berkeley, and I really wanted to know,can you fake it till you make it? Like, can you do thisjust for a little while and actually experiencea behavioral outcome that makes you seem more powerful? So we know that our nonverbalsgovern how other people think and feel about us.There's a lot of evidence."}, {"zh-tw": "而我們要問的問題是，非口語語言是否影響我們對自己的看法與感覺？確實有證據支持這個說法舉例來說，我們開心的時候會微笑但同樣地，當我們被迫在口中咬住一隻筆呈現微笑的表情時，我們也會感到開心", "en": "But our question really was, do our nonverbals governhow we think and feel about ourselves? There's some evidence that they do. So, for example, we smilewhen we feel happy, but also, when we're forced to smile by holding a pen in our teethlike this, it makes us feel happy."}, {"zh-tw": "代表這是互為因果，互相影響的。說到權力亦是如此。所以當我們感到很有權力時", "en": "So it goes both ways. When it comes to power,it also goes both ways."}, {"zh-tw": "你比較會這樣做，但你也可能假裝自己很有權力，然後真的覺得自己力量強大那第二個問題就是我們知道心理狀態會影響身體那身體是否能影響心理呢?這裡所說的心理充滿力量指的是甚麼?我指的是想法和感覺和構成我們想法和感受的生理因素我這裡是指荷爾蒙。所以我針對荷爾蒙來看", "en": "So when you feel powerful, you're more likely to do this, but it's also possiblethat when you pretend to be powerful, you are more likelyto actually feel powerful. So the second questionreally was, you know, so we know that our mindschange our bodies, but is it also truethat our bodies change our minds? And when I say minds,in the case of the powerful, what am I talking about? So I'm talking about thoughts and feelings and the sort of physiological thingsthat make up our thoughts and feelings, and in my case, that's hormones.I look at hormones."}, {"zh-tw": "充滿力量或充滿無力感在荷爾蒙層面上有什麼差別？不出乎意料，感覺自己有力的人往往比較果斷，自信，且樂觀他們確切認為機會永遠站在他們這邊", "en": "So what do the minds of the powerfulversus the powerless look like? So powerful people tend to be,not surprisingly, more assertive and more confident,more optimistic. They actually feel they're going to wineven at games of chance."}, {"zh-tw": "他們也較擅長抽象思考還有許多差異。這種人比較敢承受風險", "en": "They also tend to be ableto think more abstractly. So there are a lot of differences.They take more risks."}, {"zh-tw": "強勢的人與充滿無力感的人真的差別很大在生理上有二個重要的荷爾蒙對此有影響一是睪固酮:也就是支配性荷爾蒙一是腎上腺皮質醇:也就是壓力荷爾蒙", "en": "There are a lot of differencesbetween powerful and powerless people. Physiologically,there also are differences on two key hormones: testosterone,which is the dominance hormone, and cortisol, which is the stress hormone."}, {"zh-tw": "我們發現到靈長類裡的強勢男性有大量的睪固酮和低量的腎上腺皮質醇強勢，高效能的領袖人物也有大量睪固酮與低量的腎上腺皮質醇這表示甚麼? 當你想到權力人們往往只想到睪固酮因為它代表支配統治", "en": "So what we find is that high-poweralpha males in primate hierarchies have high testosterone and low cortisol, and powerful and effective leaders also have high testosteroneand low cortisol. So what does that mean?When you think about power, people tended to thinkonly about testosterone, because that was about dominance."}, {"zh-tw": "但力量其實也和如何處理壓力有關所以你會想見一個有支配地位強勢領袖有著很多睪固酮但同時又對壓力反應過度嗎?大概不會吧，不是嗎?你會希望那個人是充滿力量，肯定果斷，非常強勢但也不會對壓力反應過度，不能輕鬆以對", "en": "But really, power is also abouthow you react to stress. So do you want the high-powerleader that's dominant, high on testosterone,but really stress reactive? Probably not, right? You want the person who's powerfuland assertive and dominant, but not very stress reactive,the person who's laid back."}, {"zh-tw": "靈長動物的社群階級裡，如果一個強勢雄性想要奪權，如果一個雄性突然想要爭取首領這個角色幾天內，他體內的睪固酮一定急速增加而其腎上腺皮質醇劇烈地減少身體影響心理，由此可證至少就表面而言是如此同時角色的轉換也會影響心理", "en": "So we know that in primate hierarchies, if an alpha needs to take over, if an individual needs to take overan alpha role sort of suddenly, within a few days,that individual's testosterone has gone up significantly and his cortisolhas dropped significantly. So we have this evidence,both that the body can shape the mind, at least at the facial level, and also that role changescan shape the mind."}, {"zh-tw": "所以，如果你改變角色如果你做一個微小改變會怎樣像這樣的操作，這樣一個小小的干預?\"持續二分鐘\"你說，\"我要你們這樣站著，它會讓你感到更充滿力量\"接著我們就決定做這個實驗。我們將人們帶進實驗室做個小實驗這些人將擺出有權勢的姿態或無力的姿態兩分鐘，現在我們一起看這五種姿勢，雖然他們只做了其中二種", "en": "So what happens, okay,you take a role change, what happens if you do thatat a really minimal level, like this tiny manipulation,this tiny intervention? \"For two minutes,\" you say,\"I want you to stand like this, and it's going to make you feelmore powerful.\" So this is what we did. We decided to bring people into the laband run a little experiment, and these people adopted, for two minutes, either high-power posesor low-power poses, and I'm just going to showyou five of the poses, although they took on only two."}, {"zh-tw": "這是其一再兩個姿勢", "en": "So here's one. A couple more."}, {"zh-tw": "這個姿勢是媒體一般稱為\"神力女超人\" 的姿態還有這兩個", "en": "This one has been dubbedthe \"Wonder Woman\" by the media. Here are a couple more."}, {"zh-tw": "或站或坐這些是無助的姿勢", "en": "So you can be standingor you can be sitting. And here are the low-power poses."}, {"zh-tw": "你雙手交叉，試著讓自己變小一點這張顯現非常無助的樣子", "en": "So you're folding up,you're making yourself small. This one is very low-power."}, {"zh-tw": "當你摸脖子你其實在保護自己實際的狀況是，他們一進來", "en": "When you're touching your neck,you're really protecting yourself. So this is what happens."}, {"zh-tw": "先朝試管裡吐口口水我們告訴他，擺這個姿勢，兩分鐘他們不會看到姿勢的照片，因為我們不想要暗示，影響他們我們要他們自己感覺力量", "en": "They come in, they spit into a vial, for two minutes, we say,\"You need to do this or this.\" They don't look at pictures of the poses. We don't want to prime themwith a concept of power."}, {"zh-tw": "不是嗎? 所以他們擺了二分鐘姿勢", "en": "We want them to be feeling power. So two minutes they do this."}, {"zh-tw": "然後，我們拿一堆東西，問他們: \"現在你覺得自己多有力量?\"受試者接著會有一個博奕的機會接著再取一次唾液樣本就是這樣。這就是整個實驗", "en": "We then ask them, \"How powerfuldo you feel?\" on a series of items, and then we give theman opportunity to gamble, and then we take another saliva sample. That's it. That's the whole experiment."}, {"zh-tw": "我們發現到風險承擔能力，用賭博來衡量擺出有權勢姿勢的人有 86% 會選擇賭博", "en": "So this is what we find. Risk tolerance, which is the gambling, we find that when you arein the high-power pose condition, 86 percent of you will gamble."}, {"zh-tw": "擺低權勢姿態的人呢只有 60% 會賭，這兩者間差異真的很大我們發現", "en": "When you're in the low-powerpose condition, only 60 percent, and that'sa whopping significant difference. Here's what we find on testosterone."}, {"zh-tw": "這些人進來的那一刻起，擺高權勢姿態的人睪固酮會上升 20%擺低權勢姿態的人則是下降 10%所以，再說一次，只有兩分鐘，就有這種差異", "en": "From their baseline when they come in, high-power people experienceabout a 20-percent increase, and low-power people experienceabout a 10-percent decrease. So again, two minutes,and you get these changes."}, {"zh-tw": "擺有權勢姿態的人腎上腺皮質醇下降 25%，擺低權勢姿態的人腎上腺皮質醇則上升 15%", "en": "Here's what you get on cortisol. High-power people experienceabout a 25-percent decrease, and the low-power people experienceabout a 15-percent increase."}, {"zh-tw": "只要二分鐘可以讓這些荷爾蒙產生這種改變使你的腦袋成為果斷、自信和自在或高度緊張以及感到退縮。我們都曾有過這些體驗不是嗎?看來非口語的語言確實掌控我們對自己的想法感受不只是影響別人，更影響我們自己", "en": "So two minutes leadto these hormonal changes that configure your brain to basically be either assertive,confident and comfortable, or really stress-reactive,and feeling sort of shut down. And we've all had the feeling, right? So it seems that our nonverbals do governhow we think and feel about ourselves, so it's not just others,but it's also ourselves."}, {"zh-tw": "同時，我們的身體可以改變心理但下一個問題，當然，就是維持數分鐘的姿勢是否真能影響你的人生?剛剛都只是在實驗室哩，一個小實驗，你知道的，只有幾分鐘。這有什麼地方可以應用呢？", "en": "Also, our bodies change our minds. But the next question, of course, is, can power posing for a few minutes really change your lifein meaningful ways? This is in the lab, it's this little task,it's just a couple of minutes."}, {"zh-tw": "這才是我們關心的我們認為什麼時候可以應用呢？我們相信是在評量的情況下可用像是社交威脅的情境裡，在你被人評估的時候", "en": "Where can you actually apply this? Which we cared about, of course. And so we think where you want to use thisis evaluative situations, like social threat situations."}, {"zh-tw": "也許是你朋友評估你？就像是是青少年吃午餐的餐桌上那緊張樣有些人可以應用在學校董事會演講時可能是提出宣揚一個主張", "en": "Where are you being evaluated,either by your friends? For teenagers,it's at the lunchroom table. For some people it's speakingat a school board meeting."}, {"zh-tw": "或是像現在一樣的演講裡用或是找工作面試時，都用的上我們認為一般人最能認同體會的情境因為大部分人都曾經歷過也就是求職面試", "en": "It might be giving a pitchor giving a talk like this or doing a job interview. We decided that the onethat most people could relate to because most people had been through,was the job interview."}, {"zh-tw": "我們發表這個結論，媒體大肆炒作他們說，好吧，所以你去求職面試時，你得這樣做，對吧?我們當然大吃一驚，表示我的天啊，不不不，我們不是這個意思不管甚麼原因，不不，千萬別這麼做", "en": "So we published these findings, and the media are all over it, and they say, Okay, so this is what you do when you go infor the job interview, right? You know, so we were of coursehorrified, and said, Oh my God, no,that's not what we meant at all. For numerous reasons, no, don't do that."}, {"zh-tw": "這和你跟別人交談無關這是你和你自己心理對談", "en": "Again, this is not about youtalking to other people. It's you talking to yourself."}, {"zh-tw": "你在面試工作之前做甚麼? 你會這樣對吧? 你會做下來，你盯著自己的 iPhone 手機或安卓手機，我們可不想漏掉哪個", "en": "What do you do before you gointo a job interview? You do this. You're sitting down.You're looking at your iPhone -- or your Android, not tryingto leave anyone out."}, {"zh-tw": "你看著自己的筆記你把自己蜷縮起來，試著讓自己變得小一點你真正需要做的應該是到洗手間，然後這樣，花個二分鐘所以我們想測試的是這個把人帶進實驗室他們再擺高權勢或低權勢的姿態接著進行一個高度壓力的求職面試", "en": "You're looking at your notes, you're hunching up, making yourself small, when really what you shouldbe doing maybe is this, like, in the bathroom, right?Do that. Find two minutes. So that's what we want to test. Okay? So we bring people into a lab, and they do either high-or low-power poses again, they go througha very stressful job interview."}, {"zh-tw": "為時五分鐘。全程錄影他們同時也被評論，而這些考官都接受過訓練不會給予任何非語言的回饋所以他們看起來就像這樣，想像一下", "en": "It's five minutes long.They are being recorded. They're being judged also, and the judges are trainedto give no nonverbal feedback, so they look like this."}, {"zh-tw": "這個人正在面試你整整五分鐘，甚麼都沒有，這比刁難詰問更難受", "en": "Imagine this is the personinterviewing you. So for five minutes, nothing,and this is worse than being heckled."}, {"zh-tw": "大家都不喜歡這種方式。這就是 Marianne LaFrance 所謂的\"陷入社交流沙中\"這可以大大激發你的腎上腺皮質醇", "en": "People hate this. It's what Marianne LaFrance calls\"standing in social quicksand.\" So this really spikes your cortisol."}, {"zh-tw": "我們給予受試者這種面試然後看結果如何我們找了四個打分數的人看這些面試錄影", "en": "So this is the job interviewwe put them through, because we really wantedto see what happened. We then have these coders lookat these tapes, four of them."}, {"zh-tw": "他們不知假設前提和也不了解測試的條件沒有人知道誰擺甚麼樣的姿勢最後他們觀看這些帶子然後他們說，\"噢，我們想要錄用這些人\"", "en": "They're blind to the hypothesis.They're blind to the conditions. They have no ideawho's been posing in what pose, and they end up lookingat these sets of tapes, and they say,\"We want to hire these people,\" all the high-power posers."}, {"zh-tw": "也就是那些擺高權勢姿勢的人-- \"這些人我們不想錄用\"我們對這些人的整體印象也比較正面但背後的原因是甚麼? 跟演講的內容無關", "en": "\"We don't want to hire these people. We also evaluate these peoplemuch more positively overall.\" But what's driving it? It's not about the content of the speech."}, {"zh-tw": "而是他們把自己帶進了演講裡我們也衡量一些其他的變數和能力有關，像是演講的結構好不好它有多棒? 講者的學經歷?全都無關。有影響的是", "en": "It's about the presencethat they're bringing to the speech. Because we rate themon all these variables related to competence,like, how well-structured is the speech? How good is it?What are their qualifications? No effect on those things.This is what's affected."}, {"zh-tw": "這些事。基本上人們表現出真實的自己", "en": "These kinds of things. People are bringingtheir true selves, basically."}, {"zh-tw": "就他們自己他們誠實的帶入了自己的種種意念毫無保留", "en": "They're bringing themselves. They bring their ideas, but as themselves, with no, you know, residue over them."}, {"zh-tw": "這就是背後真實的力量，或造成影響所以當我告訴人們我們的身體會改變心理，心理會改變行為而行為會改變結果，他們回我說\"我不這麼想--聽起來好像是假的\" 對嗎?", "en": "So this is what's driving the effect,or mediating the effect. So when I tell people about this, that our bodies change our mindsand our minds can change our behavior, and our behavior can changeour outcomes, they say to me, \"It feels fake.\" Right?
