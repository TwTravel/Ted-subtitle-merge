I discovered this baron Manhattan's Lower East Side that hosted a weekly poetry open Mic, and my bewildered,but supportive, parents took me to soak in every ounceof spoken word that I could."}, {"zh-tw": "我是那之中最小的，起碼比他們小了１０歲但鮑威利詩會的詩人們似乎不認為１４歲小女生的好奇心令人厭煩", "en": "I was the youngest by at least a decade, but somehow the poetsat the Bowery Poetry Club didn't seem botheredby the 14-year-old wandering about. In fact, they welcomed me."}, {"zh-tw": "他們甚至很歡迎我就在這裡，我聽著那些詩人分享他們的故事我學到，有聲詩不一定要充滿憤慨它也可以是有趣的，痛苦的嚴肅的或是愚笨的從此，鮑威利詩會變成我的教室和另一個家而那些表演的詩人們也鼓勵我分享自己的故事", "en": "And it was here, listening to these poetsshare their stories, that I learned that spoken-wordpoetry didn't have to be indignant, it could be fun or painful or serious or silly. The Bowery Poetry Club becamemy classroom and my home, and the poets who performed encouraged me to share my stories as well."}, {"zh-tw": "不必在乎自己年紀是否太小他們告訴我「就寫出妳的１４歲吧」我這麼做了。而接下來每個禮拜那些既有才華，又成熟的詩人們與我一同歡笑，或發出同情的嘆息他們為我鼓掌，並告訴我「嘿，我也感受到了」現在我將我創作有聲詩的旅程劃分為三個階段", "en": "Never mind the fact that I was 14. They told me, \"Write about being 14.\" So I did and stood amazed every week when these brilliant, grown-up poets laughed with me and groaned their sympathy and clapped and told me,\"Hey, I really felt that too.\" Now I can divide my spoken-word journey into three steps."}, {"zh-tw": "第一階段是當我說「我可以，我可以做得到」這得要感謝那位穿著連帽衫的女孩第二階段是當我說「我會，我會繼續創作", "en": "Step one was the moment I said, \"I can. I can do this.\" And that was thanks to a girl in a hoodie. Step two was the moment I said, \"I will. I will continue."}, {"zh-tw": "我深愛有聲詩，我也會不斷不斷的挑戰」然後第三階段開始了我發現如果我並不滿心憤怒，就不需要再寫出那些憤慨的詩有些事物對我而言很特別而我越是專注在那些事物上我的詩就變的越奇怪但這才像我寫的詩", "en": "I love spoken word. I will keepcoming back week after week.\" And step three began when I realized I didn't haveto write indignant poems, if that's not what I was. There were thingsthat were specific to me, and the more that I focusedon those things, the weirder my poetry got, but the more that it felt like mine."}, {"zh-tw": "並不是常言所說「寫出你知道的」就好而是集結你至今所累積的智慧與經驗來幫助你泅潛於未知的世界我利用詩來釐清難以理解的事物但我寫每一首詩都會帶著滿滿的包袱裡面裝著我去過的所有地方", "en": "It's not just the adage\"Write what you know.\" It's about gathering upall of the knowledge and experience you've collected up to now to help you dive into the thingsyou don't know. I use poetry to help me workthrough what I don't understand, but I show up to each new poem with a backpack fullof everywhere else that I've been."}, {"zh-tw": "我在大學裡遇到一位志同道合的同伴他與我一同分享有聲詩的魔力事實上，Phil Kaye與我碰巧擁有相同的姓", "en": "When I got to university,I met a fellow poet who shared my belief in the magicof spoken-word poetry.

We stayed full-time students,but in between we traveled, performing and teaching nine-year-olds to MFA candidates, from California to Indiana to India to a public high schooljust up the street from campus."}, {"zh-tw": "我們不斷地看見有聲詩如何突破枷鎖的束縛但有時詩會變的令人害怕", "en": "And we saw over and over the way that spoken-word poetry cracks open locks. But it turns out sometimes,poetry can be really scary."}, {"zh-tw": "有時你必須用些小伎倆才能讓年輕人寫詩所以我想到可以寫清單，每個人都會寫清單", "en": "Turns out sometimes, you have to trick teenagersinto writing poetry. So I came up with lists.Everyone can write lists."}, {"zh-tw": "而我第一個指定他們寫的就是10件我所知道的真實事物接下來你就會發現如果我們願意大聲分享自己的清單這時候，你會突然明白到原來有人有跟你清單上完全一樣或是非常相似的事物", "en": "And the first list that I assign is \"10 Things I Know to be True.\" And here's what happens,you would discover it too if we all started sharingour lists out loud.

Third, someone has somethingyou've never even heard of before."}, {"zh-tw": "第四，有人會寫出你自認完全了解的事物但引導你從一個全新的角度詮釋我告訴他們，一個好故事的開端就始於四個方向的交集每個都與你的熱情有關或足以引起別人的興趣", "en": "Fourth, someone has somethingyou thought you knew everything about, but they're introducinga new angle of looking at it. And I tell people that this iswhere great stories start from -- these four intersections of what you're passionate about and what others might be invested in."}, {"zh-tw": "絕大多數的人在這次練習都回答得很棒但其中一名學生，一位叫做Charlotte的新鮮人", "en": "And most people respondreally well to this exercise. But one of my students,a freshman named Charlotte, was not convinced."}, {"zh-tw": "沒有被說服Charlotte非常會寫清單，但她拒絕寫出任何一首詩她說「老師，我真的不有趣", "en": "Charlotte was very good at writing lists,but she refused to write any poems. \"Miss,\" she'd say,\"I'm just not interesting."}, {"zh-tw": "我沒一件有趣的事可以說」於是我指派一份又一份的清單給她寫有一天我讓她寫10件我該從現在開始學習的事物Charlotte的清單上，第三件寫著在我這年紀，我要試著三次不愛上任何男孩我問她那是什麼意思她說「老師，說來話長」我說「Charlotte，這聽起來很有趣喔!」於是她開始創作她的第一首詩一首迴異於我所聽過的任何愛情詩這首詩的開頭是Anderson Cooper是一個完美的男人你有看到他與Michael Phelps在節目 -- ６０分鐘裡進行的游泳比賽嗎？他全身只穿著一件泳褲潛於水中，一心一意只想贏得冠軍比賽過後，他甩著他濕潤，如雲般銀白的頭髮說「你是神」不，Anderson，你才是神現在，我知道變酷的最好方法就是讓自己看起來泰若自然絕對不讓任何事嚇到你讓你驚嘆或是使你興奮", "en": "I don't have anything interesting to say.\" So I assigned her list after list, and one day I assigned the list \"10 Things I Should Have Learned by Now.\" Number three on Charlotte's list was, \"I should have learnednot to crush on guys three times my age.\" I asked her what that meant, and she said, \"Miss,it's kind of a long story.\" And I said, \"Charlotte, it soundspretty interesting to me.\" And so she wrote her first poem, a love poem unlike anyI had ever heard before. And the poem began, \"Anderson Cooper is a gorgeous man.\" \"Did you see him on 60 Minutes, racing Michael Phelps in a pool -- nothing but swim trunks on -- diving in the water, determinedto beat this swimming champion? After the race, he tossedhis wet, cloud-white hair and said, 'You're a god.' No, Anderson, you're the god.\" Now, I know that the number onerule to being cool is to seem unfazed, to never admit that anything scares you or impresses you or excites you."}, {"zh-tw": "有人跟我說過人生就像這樣你保護自己免於被難以意料的悲傷與疼痛傷害", "en": "Somebody once told me it's like walking through life like this. You protect yourself from all the unexpected miseriesor hurt that might show up."}, {"zh-tw": "但我試著伸出雙手是的，這樣或許會接住所有的悲傷和疼痛但這代表所有美麗，令人驚豔的事物也同樣會從天上掉落而我已準備要將它們全部抓住", "en": "But I try to walk through life like this. And yes, that means catchingall of those miseries and hurt, but it also meansthat when beautiful, amazing things just fall out of the sky, I'm ready to catch them."}, {"zh-tw": "我利用有聲詩來幫助學生重新發掘新奇改變他們只想耍酷的本能讓他們主動試著去了解發生在他們周遭的一切這樣他們就可以重新詮釋，並從之中創造出新的事物我並不認為有聲詩是一種最理想的藝術型態", "en": "I use spoken word to help my students rediscover wonder, to fight their instinctsto be cool and unfazed and, instead, actively pursue beingengaged with what goes on around them, so that they can reinterpretand create something from it. It's not that I thinkthat spoken-word poetry is the ideal art form."}, {"zh-tw": "我一直在尋找一個最棒的方法來敘述故事我創作詩的同時，一邊創作音樂劇和短片", "en": "I'm always trying to findthe best way to tell each story. I write musicals; I make short filmsalongside my poems."}, {"zh-tw": "但我教授有聲詩是因為這最容易上手不是每個人都懂音樂或擁有一台照相機但每個人或多或少都會溝通每個人都有故事值得讓我們從中學習", "en": "But I teach spoken-word poetry because it's accessible. Not everyone can read musicor owns a camera, but everyone can communicate in some way, and everyone has storiesthat the rest of us can learn from."}, {"zh-tw": "再加上，有聲詩可以迅速產生聯繫人覺得寂寞，或是不被了解並不是件罕見的事但有聲詩教會他們如果你有能力表達自己或願意與眾人分享你的故事與意見你就會得到滿屋子的同儕們或是任何願意傾聽的人的讚揚", "en": "Plus, spoken-word poetry allowsfor immediate connection. It's not uncommonto feel like you're alone or that nobody understands you, but spoken word teaches that if you have the abilityto express yourself and the courage to presentthose stories and opinions, you could be rewarded with a room full of your peers, or your community, who will listen."}, {"zh-tw": "甚至也會有一位身穿連帽衫的巨大女孩與你感同身受這時你就會有那種奇妙的體會尤其當你只是個１４歲的孩子", "en": "And maybe even a giant girl in a hoodie who will connect with what you've shared.

I'm so lucky that there'sthis archive of performances that I can share with my students."}, {"zh-tw": "提供了更多機會讓他們發現與自己有關聯的詩和詩人這真的非常有吸引力，你會發現重複寫同一首詩或述說同樣的故事，是多麼具吸引力的一件事因為它們會為你帶來掌聲", "en": "It allows for even more opportunities for them to find a poet or a poemthat they connect to. Once you've figured this out, it is tempting to keepwriting the same poem, or keep telling the same story,over and over, once you've figured outthat it will gain you applause."}, {"zh-tw": "只教你表達自己是不夠的你必須要自我成長與自我發掘冒險去挑戰你自己", "en": "It's not enough to just teachthat you can express yourself. You have to grow and explore and take risks and challenge yourself."}, {"zh-tw": "這就是階段三為你的作品注滿那些讓你成為你的特殊事物儘管那些事可能會不斷改變因為階段三永遠沒有終止的一天", "en": "And that is step three: infusing the work you're doing with the specific thingsthat make you you, even while those thingsare always changing. Because step three never ends."}, {"zh-tw": "但你不能到達階段三除非你先經歷階段一: 我可以我教書的時候不斷旅遊所以無法看到每位學生達到階段三但我很幸運能夠看到Charlotte展開她全新的人生旅程我看到她領悟只要將她所有知道的事情放進她的作品中她就可以創作出屬於自己的詩也許有關眼球、電梯和愛探險的朵拉", "en": "But you don't get to start on step three, until you take step one first: \"I can.\" I travel a lot while I'm teaching, and I don't always get to watchall of my students reach their step three, but I was very lucky with Charlotte, that I got to watch her journeyunfold the way it did. I watched her realize that, by putting the things that she knowsto be true into the work she's doing, she can create poemsthat only Charlotte can write, about eyeballs and elevatorsand Dora the Explorer."}, {"zh-tw": "而我則試著述說只有我知道的故事就像這個故事我花了很多時間去思考，如何以最棒的方式呈現這個故事我想過最好的方式是不是該用簡報或短片來呈現但到底那裏才是真正的開頭，過程或著是結尾？我也想，到了演講的結尾我會找到答案？還是不會？", "en": "And I'm trying to tellstories only I can tell -- like this story. I spent a lot of time thinkingabout the best way to tell this story, and I wondered if the best way was going to bea PowerPoint, a short film -- And where exactly was the beginning,the middle or the end?
