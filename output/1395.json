I had absolutely no idea what was going to happen next."}, {"zh-tw": "我那時忙著要完成我的博士學位,而我讀的是完全不相干的領域,我研究人們如何互動, 如何協調貢獻,在維基百科上的文章如何形成--在那樣的系統下如何能確保品質。我也在研發一個叫哥本哈根之輪的東西,基本上這是一台很漂亮的電動腳踏車,研發的中心在痲省理工學院的SENSEable City實驗室。", "en": "I was, in fact, busy trying to finish off my Ph.D., which was in a completely unrelated area of how people interact, contributors interact, how articles are formed in Wikipedia -- trying to figure out how quality emerges from the system.

Now anemia -- I'm an engineer, but even I knew -- that anemia is something which is not supposed to be fatal."}, {"zh-tw": "貧血症的解葯大概大家都知道。我是說葉酸和補鐵藥片等之類的--這些藥物的價格也很便宜,治療貧血症也很有效。", "en": "It is something which probably the cure is known.

We knew it had to be these three things that the machine had to have."}, {"zh-tw": "我們認爲這個儀器要沒有針頭, 不用針刺,才不會產生醫療用廢棄物,才不會帶來新的問題。這個機器也要簡單到讓所有醫工能使用。", "en": "We knew it had to be something which had no needles, no pricking, so it would have adoption, it would not have medical waste, all those problems.

This will help ASHA workers diagnose anemia at the point of care."}, {"zh-tw": "我來解釋一下這是怎麽辦到的。你可以看到裏面有一點光。", "en": "I'll explain a little bit about how it works. You might have seen a little light inside of it."}, {"zh-tw": "事實上裏面有三種波長不同的光。我們基本上將光打穿過人體組織,看有多少光能穿透,有多少被折射和吸收,我們可以算出血液裏血紅蛋白的數量。", "en": "In fact, there are three lights in there, three wavelengths of light. And we essentially pass light right through the tissue, and from understanding how much of it is transmitted, how much of it is scattered and how much of it is absorbed, we can figure out how much hemoglobin is there in the blood."}, {"zh-tw": "這是運用一個叫光學體積描記術的原則來計算的。我們覺得十分的興奮,因爲像這樣的非侵入性的檢驗技術在未來能問世。", "en": "And this is something which is based on a principle called photoplethysmography.

But fundamentally, what I believe is that the map behind of me is called basically the map of anemia."}, {"zh-tw": "顯示了全球因貧血症而死亡的人數統計。你可以看到某些地區的情形特別嚴重--像在南亞、非洲。", "en": "It's the death rates caused by anemia globally. You'll notice, of course, that there are hot spots -- South Asia, Africa."}, {"zh-tw": "我的業務計劃很簡單。我只需要把這些儀器賣給所有的診所。", "en": "My business plan is very simple. I'm just going to sell these to every clinic in the world."}, {"zh-tw": "是一個很簡單的業務計劃。當我完成時, 即是2020年,世界衛生組織再發佈新的資料的時候,新的貧血症分佈圖將會是這樣。", "en": "That's a simple bottom-line business plan.
