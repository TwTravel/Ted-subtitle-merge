And the answer I like to offer is what they typically do is they thinkabout the future of wars in the context of war."}, {"zh-tw": "而我花費了15年時間所做的事情其實我花了14年才搞清楚我到底在做什麼——是我卻是在非戰爭的大背景下思考戰爭的未來所以我傾向於關注那些介於戰爭和和平之間的事情", "en": "And what I've spent 15 yearsdoing in this business -- and it's taken me almost14 to figure it out -- is I think about the future of warsin the context of everything else. So I tend to specializeon the scene between war and peace."}, {"zh-tw": "我要向大家介紹的是一本書中的一個觀點呃~不是一個，而是好幾個觀點正是為此我才周遊世界與各國軍方交流", "en": "The material I'm going to showyou is one idea from a book with a lot of ideas.

OK? The theory of anti-access, area-denialasymmetrical strategies -- gobbledygook that we sell to Congress, because if we just told themwe can kick anybody's asses they wouldn't buy usall the stuff we want.
