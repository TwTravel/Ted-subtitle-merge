I was kneeling long afterthe congregation was on its feet, dip both hands into holy water, trace the trinity across my chest, my tiny body drooping like a question mark all over the wooden pew. I asked Jesus to fix me, and when he did not answer I befriended silence in the hopesthat my sin would burn and salve my mouth would dissolve like sugar on tongue, but shame lingered as an aftertaste."}, {"zh-tw": "為了讓我再次聖潔，我的母親告訴我有如奇蹟一般的我，長大以後可以隨心所欲。我決定要當個男孩。", "en": "And in an attemptto reintroduce me to sanctity, my mother told me of the miracle I was, said I could grow up to be anything I want. I decided to be a boy."}, {"zh-tw": "真是可愛。我戴鴨舌帽、滿口無牙咧嘴而笑，以破皮膝蓋取得街頭信譽，逃避現實，遊戲人間。", "en": "It was cute. I had snapback, toothless grin, used skinned knees as street cred, played hide and seek with what was left of my goal."}, {"zh-tw": "我就是那樣。我是這場遊戲贏家，其他孩子連玩都不會，我在解剖學中是個謎，是個被提出卻無解的問題，走在彆扭男孩與抱歉女孩間的繩索上，然而來到十二歲，男孩樣在別人眼中已不再可愛。", "en": "I was it. The winner to a game the other kids couldn't play, I was the mystery of an anatomy, a question asked but not answered, tightroping between awkward boyand apologetic girl, and when I turned 12, the boy phasewasn't deemed cute anymore."}, {"zh-tw": "當年我和那念舊的阿姨見面，惦記我雙膝在裙影下的她提醒我這種態度永遠都找不到老公，我的存在是為了嫁為人婦、懷孕生子。我嚥下他們的冷嘲熱諷、譏笑辱罵。", "en": "It was met with nostalgic aunts who missedseeing my knees in the shadow of skirts, who reminded me that my kind of attitudewould never bring a husband home, that I exist for heterosexual marriageand child-bearing. And I swallowed their insultsalong with their slurs."}, {"zh-tw": "可想而知，我沒有出櫃。同校的孩子擅自張揚，而我卻毫不知情。", "en": "Naturally, I did notcome out of the closet. The kids at my school opened itwithout my permission."}, {"zh-tw": "他們用一個我沒聽過的名字叫我：「蕾絲邊」（女同志），但我像男孩，而非女孩；我像肯尼，而非芭比。我不討厭我的身體，我只是夠愛它，接受任何模樣的它，我將身體看做房子，當你的房子垮下，你沒有就此逃離，你讓它舒適得可以容納自己內在的一切，你讓它漂亮得可以邀請客人登門拜訪，你讓地板堅固得可以讓你站穩腳步。", "en": "Called me by a name I did not recognize, said \"lesbian,\" but I was more boy than girl,more Ken than Barbie. It had nothing to do with hating my body, I just love it enough to let it go, I treat it like a house, and when your house is falling apart, you do not evacuate, you make it comfortable enoughto house all your insides, you make it pretty enoughto invite guests over, you make the floorboardsstrong enough to stand on."}, {"zh-tw": "我的母親害怕我已認定自己如同已逝之人。她細數（跨性別自殺）何米亞李拉赫、卜雷克留下的蜚短流長。", "en": "My mother fears I have namedmyself after fading things. As she counts the echoesleft behind by Mya Hall, Leelah Alcorn, Blake Brockington."}, {"zh-tw": "她害怕我會一聲不響離開人世，我會成為公車站牌下大家口中的悲劇主角。她聲稱我已讓自己步入陵墓，我是具活棺木，新聞頭條已將我的身分塑造為奇人異士，布魯斯．詹納成為話題，而生在這軀殼內的殘酷現實卻化為一顆星號，出現在平等頁面的最後一行。", "en": "She fears that I'll die without a whisper, that I'll turn into \"what a shame\"conversations at the bus stop. She claims I have turned myselfinto a mausoleum, that I am a walking casket, news headlines have turnedmy identity into a spectacle, Bruce Jenner on everyone's lipswhile the brutality of living in this body becomes an asterisk at the bottom of equality pages."}, {"zh-tw": "甚至沒有人認為我們也是人，因為比起血肉之軀，我們更像鬼魂，因為大家害怕我的性別表現是個把戲，生來是為了和大家作對，不經意地蠱惑人心，我的身體是眾人目光與雙手的饗宴，一旦他們享盡我的酷兒形象，就會反芻所有不討喜的部分。他們會將我放回櫃子，置身在所有骷髏之間。", "en": "No one ever thinks of us as human because we are more ghost than flesh, because people fear thatmy gender expression is a trick, that it exists to be perverse, that it ensnares themwithout their consent, that my body is a feastfor their eyes and hands and once they have fed off my queer, they'll regurgitate all the partsthey did not like. They'll put me back into the closet,hang me with all the other skeletons."}, {"zh-tw": "我會成為最引人注目的那一個。你可曾發現說服人們踏進棺材、在墓碑上寫錯他們的名字有多麼容易。", "en": "I will be the best attraction. Can you see how easy it isto talk people into coffins, to misspell their names on gravestones."}, {"zh-tw": "而大家仍疑惑為何有男孩自甘墮落，他們遠離高中大門，他們害怕轉眼間成為下一個社群媒體的主題標籤，害怕教室裡議論紛紛，變得像是審判日，而當代潮流是開始擁抱跨性別孩童，而非家長。我疑惑要多久時間才會讓變性人自殺遺言顯得過於累贅，讓我們了解身體不是罪的教訓，然後學會如何愛身體。", "en": "And people still wonder whythere are boys rotting, they go awayin high school hallways they are afraid of becoming anotherhashtag in a second afraid of classroom discussionsbecoming like judgment day and now oncoming traffic is embracingmore transgender children than parents. I wonder how long it will be before the trans suicide notesstart to feel redundant, before we realize that our bodiesbecome lessons about sin way before we learn how to love them."}, {"zh-tw": "就像上帝未曾拯救我的一絲氣息與憐憫，就像我的血液不是洗淨耶穌雙腳的酒。我的禱告此刻哽在喉中。", "en": "Like God didn't saveall this breath and mercy, like my blood is not the winethat washed over Jesus' feet. My prayers are nowgetting stuck in my throat."}, {"zh-tw": "也許我終於被治癒了，也許我根本毫不在乎，也許上帝終於聽進了我的禱告。謝謝。", "en": "Maybe I am finally fixed, maybe I just don't care, maybe God finally listened to my prayers. Thank you."}], "title": "Lee Mokobe A Powerful Poem About What It Feels Like To Be Transgender"}
