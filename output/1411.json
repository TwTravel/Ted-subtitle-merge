For students, it's quite an experience, but for a school, it could be very difficult or expensive to maintain."}, {"zh-tw": "所以大部份的解剖學課程當中，是沒有真正解剖屍體的。有可能是因為我剛剛說的原因，或是看你在哪裡，屍體可能不是那麼容易取得。", "en": "So we learned the majority of anatomic classes taught, they do not have a cadaver dissection lab. Maybe those reasons, or depending on where you are, cadavers may not be easily available."}, {"zh-tw": "為了解決這個問題，我們和史丹佛的布朗博士一起研發了虛擬解剖桌。所以我們把這個叫作解剖桌。", "en": "So to address this, we developed with a Dr. Brown in Stanford: virtual dissection table. So we call this Anatomage Table."}, {"zh-tw": "有了這個解剖桌，學生可以在沒有屍體的狀況下，體驗解剖。桌子的形式是很重要的，因為它是觸感互動的，就跟在解剖實驗室裡面的一樣，或更進一步說，跟真正對病患作手術時一樣，你可以跟桌子互動。", "en": "So with this Anatomage Table, students can experience the dissection without a human cadaver. And the table form is important, and since it's touch-interactive, just like the way they do dissections in the lab, or furthermore just the way a surgeon operates on a patient you can literally interact with your table."}, {"zh-tw": "我們的數位人體跟實際大小一樣，所以這跟學生看真正的解剖是一模一樣的。我要來做一些示範。", "en": "Our digital body is one-to-one life size, so this is exactly the way students will see the real anatomy. I'm going to do some demonstrations."}, {"zh-tw": "你們可以看到的，我用我的手指頭來跟這個數位人體互動。我要來做一些切割。", "en": "As you can see, I use my finger to interact with my digital body. I'm going to do some cuts."}, {"zh-tw": "我可以在任何地方切，像是這裡。然後它會呈現出裡面的樣子。", "en": "I can cut any way I want to, so I cut right here. Then it's going to show inside."}, {"zh-tw": "我可以在不同的地方做切割。或許我可以切這裡，看看腦袋，然後我也可以作更改。", "en": "And I can change my cut to see different parts. Maybe I can cut there, see the brain, and I can change my cut."}, {"zh-tw": "你們可以看到一些內在器官。所以我們叫這個切割模式。", "en": "You can see some internal organs. So we call this the slicer mode."}, {"zh-tw": "好，我要來再下一刀。就在這裡。", "en": "OK, I'm going to do another cut. Right there."}, {"zh-tw": "這會讓我們看到很多內在的結構。所以如果我想要看後面，我可以把它翻轉過來，就可以從後面看。", "en": "This shows a lot of internal structures. So if I want to see the back side, I can flip and see from behind."}, {"zh-tw": "像是這樣。所以如果這些影像對你們來說有點不舒服或有點困擾，那表示我們做得很好。", "en": "Like this. So if these images are uncomfortable to you or disturbing to you, that means we did the right job."}, {"zh-tw": "我們的醫生說這是視覺獎勵。所以除了只是對身體做切割，我想要做一些在臨床上更有意義的解剖。", "en": "So our doctors said these are eye candies. So instead of just butchering the body, I'd like to do more clinically meaningful dissections."}, {"zh-tw": "我接下來要做的是將全部的皮、肌肉、骨頭撕下，這樣可以看到內在器官。在這裡。", "en": "What I'm going to do is I'm going to peel off all the skin, muscles and bones, just to see a few internal organs. Right here."}, {"zh-tw": "假設我要在這裡切開肝臟。好。", "en": "Let's say I'm going to cut the liver right here. OK."}, {"zh-tw": "假設我想要看心臟。我要在這做一些手術。", "en": "Let's say I'm interested in looking at the heart. I'm going to do some surgery here."}, {"zh-tw": "我要切開一些血管、動脈。哎呀！", "en": "I'm going to cut some veins, arteries. Oops! ..."}, {"zh-tw": "在真正的手術當中絕對不想要聽到「哎呀！」幸運的是，我們的數位人可以「復原」。好。", "en": "You don't want to hear \"oops\" in real surgery. But fortunately, our digital man has \"undo.\" Okay."}, {"zh-tw": "可以。放大一些。", "en": "All right then. Let me zoom in."}, {"zh-tw": "我要在這裡下刀。然後你們可以看到心臟裡面。", "en": "I'm going to make a cut right there. And then you can see the inside of the heart."}, {"zh-tw": "你們可以看到心房和心室，可以看到血液如何流到動脈和血管。就像這樣，學生可以分離任何部位並以各種方式作解剖。", "en": "You can see the atrium and the ventricles, how blood flows to our arteries and veins. Just like this, students can isolate anybody and dissect any way you want to."}, {"zh-tw": "也不一定要是解剖。因為是數位的，我們可以還原解剖。", "en": "It doesn't have to be always dissection. Since it's digital, we can do reverse dissection."}, {"zh-tw": "讓我示範你們看，我要從骨骼結構開始，然後我可以加一些內臟。好。", "en": "So let me show you, I'm going to start with the skeletal structure, and I can add a few internal organs. Yep."}, {"zh-tw": "或許我可以更快的加上去。我也可以慢慢加肌肉，就像這樣。", "en": "Maybe I can add quickly this way. And I can build muscles gradually, just like that."}, {"zh-tw": "我們可以看到肌腱和肌肉。真希望我也可以這麼快長出肌肉。", "en": "We can see tendons and muscles. Wish I could build my muscle this fast."}, {"zh-tw": "這是另外一個學習解剖學的方式。另外一個我可以給你們看的是，很多時候，醫生會需要看到病人的X光片。", "en": "And this is another way to learn anatomy. Another thing I can show you is, more often than not, doctors get to meet patients in X-ray form."}, {"zh-tw": "所以，解剖桌可以顯示這樣的身體在X光片上會是怎麼樣的。你也可以跟X光片互動，然後如果你想要的話，你也可以比較身體在X光片的樣子。", "en": "So, Anatomage Table shows exactly how the anatomy will appear in X-ray. You can also interact with your X-ray, and also if you want, you can compare with how anatomy would appear in X-ray, too."}, {"zh-tw": "當你結束的時候，只要把這個「身體」拿回來，「身體」就可以供下次使用。我們的桌子，也可以改變性別。", "en": "So when you are done, just bring back the body and then it's ready for another session. It looks like our table also can transform gender, too."}, {"zh-tw": "現在是女生。這就是解剖桌。謝謝。", "en": "It's a female now. So this is Anatomage Table. Thank you."}], "title": "Jack Choi On The Virtual Dissection Table"}
