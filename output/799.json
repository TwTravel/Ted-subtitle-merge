I'm a game designer. I've been making gamesonline now for 10 years, and my goal for the next decade is to try to make it as easyto save the world in real life as it is to save the worldin online games. Now, I have a plan for this, and it entails convincing more people, including all of you, to spend more timeplaying bigger and better games."}, {"zh-tw": "現在，我們每個禮拜共花三十億個鐘頭在玩線上遊戲。你們可能有人在想，「哇！花那麼多時間打電動？」", "en": "Right now we spend three billion hoursa week playing online games. Some of you might be thinking, \"That's a lot of timeto spend playing games."}, {"zh-tw": "這樣花太多時間在遊戲上了現實生活中，還有很多我們得解決的急迫問題但事實上，根據我在\"未來學會(The Institute For The Future)\"所做的研究顯示事實正好相反。每週30億小時的遊戲時間還遠遠不夠解決世上最急迫的問題。", "en": "Maybe too much time, considering how many urgent problemswe have to solve in the real world.\" But actually, according to my researchat the Institute for the Future, actually the opposite is true. Three billion hours a weekis not nearly enough game play to solve the world's most urgent problems."}, {"zh-tw": "其實，我認為如果我們想在地球上熬過下個世紀，我們必須大幅增加我們玩遊戲的總時數。我計算過我們需要的總時數是每週210億小時。", "en": "In fact, I believethat if we want to survive the next century on this planet, we need to increasethat total dramatically. I've calculated the total we need at 21 billion hoursof game play every week."}, {"zh-tw": "所以，這其實跟我們一般認知有些相違背。好，讓我再說一次，大家體會一下。如果我們想解決以下這些問題：飢餓、貧困、全球暖化、國際衝突、肥胖問題，我堅信我們必須立志去玩線上遊戲...至少每週210億小時，限時十年內！真的，我是認真的。", "en": "So, that's probably a bitof a counter-intuitive idea, so I'll say it again, let it sink in: If we want to solve problems like hunger, poverty, climate change,global conflict, obesity, I believe that we need to aspireto play games online for at least 21 billion hours a week,by the end of the next decade.

You probably see the sense of urgency, a little bit of fear,but intense concentration, deep, deep focus on tacklinga really difficult problem."}, {"zh-tw": "但如果你是玩家，你就會發現一些細微之處，像是眼睛和嘴角因為樂觀而上揚、挑起的眉毛表示感到驚喜...這個玩家正接近所謂的...史詩級的勝利(epic win)噢！你們聽過嘛！那很好", "en": "If you are a gamer, you will noticea few nuances here: the crinkle of the eyes up,and around the mouth is a sign of optimism, and the eyebrows up is surprise.

Good."}, {"zh-tw": "這就是我做出的“不擅長生活”表情這也是我在加州柏克萊一個老社區進修我的博士學位時的一個塗鴉我研究“為什麼我們在虛擬遊戲世界中的表現比現實世界更好”", "en": "This is me makingthe \"I'm Not Good At Life\" face. This is a piece of graffitiin my old neighborhood in Berkeley, California,where I did my PhD on why we're better in gamesthan we are in real life."}, {"zh-tw": "同時這也是很多玩家的問題我們覺得自己在現實的表現無法像在遊戲中一樣好", "en": "And this is a problemthat a lot of gamers have.

We do achieve more in game worlds."}, {"zh-tw": "但我指的好，還包含去做要緊事情的内在動力、激起與相互合作的靈感。當我們處於遊戲世界時我認為，我們大多數人可以做\"最好的自己\"，如果有人遇難，我們就會義無反顧的去幫忙並且會持之以恆的解决一個問題面對挫折我們會勇敢的站起来，並繼續奮鬥", "en": "But I also mean good as in motivatedto do something that matters -- inspired to collaborate and to cooperate.

So that's what I wanted to studywhen I was a graduate student."}, {"zh-tw": "到底為什麼，遊戲讓我們覺得沒有事情是辦不到的呢？我們要怎麼把遊戲時的這種感覺應用到現實工作生活中？因此，我研究了一些類似《魔獸世界》的遊戲它們才是理想的，解决合作問題的平台我注意到為什麼史詩般的勝利，在線上遊戲中這麼容易達到", "en": "What about games makes it impossible to feel that we can't achieve everything? How can we take those feelings from games and apply them to real-world work? So I looked at gameslike World of Warcraft, which is really the ideal collaborativeproblem-solving environment.

But not just any mission, it's a mission that is perfectly matchedwith your current level in the game."}, {"zh-tw": "因此，你有能力做到的他們不會分派一個你做不到的任務給你", "en": "Right? So you can do it. They never give you a challengeyou can't achieve."}, {"zh-tw": "但快要完成這任務的最後時刻，你一定得竭盡全力在魔獸世界裡，每個人都有職業沒有人坐在那發呆總是會有些特别且重要的任務要完成", "en": "But it is on the vergeof what you're capable of, so you have to try hard. But there's no unemploymentin World of Warcraft; no sitting around, wringing your hands -- there's always somethingspecific and important to be done."}, {"zh-tw": "而且許多任務都要大家的合作不論到哪哩，都會有成千上萬人等著和你合作幫助你完成史詩級的任務", "en": "There are also tons of collaborators. Everywhere you go,hundreds of thousands of people ready to work with youto achieve your epic mission."}, {"zh-tw": "現實生活就沒這麼簡單了這種指尖上的成就感隨便招呼就有人幫忙的感覺遊戲中也有史詩般、鼓舞人心的故事劇情，告訴我們為何而來、為何而戰得到的都是正面的評價", "en": "That's not something we havein real life that easily, this sense that at our fingertipsare tons of collaborators. And there's this epic story,this inspiring story of why we're there, and what we're doing, and we get all this positive feedback."}, {"zh-tw": "你們一定聽過，升等之後，力量＋１智力也會＋１現實生活中就沒有這種立即回饋", "en": "You guys have heard of leveling up,+1 strength, +1 intelligence. We don't get that kindof constant feedback in real life."}, {"zh-tw": "當我走下講台，我才不會有演講力＋１、瘋狂點子＋１、甚至到＋２０的回饋現實生活中沒有任何獎勵", "en": "When I get off this stage, I'm not going to have+1 speaking, and +1 crazy idea, +20 crazy idea. I don't get that feedback in real life."}, {"zh-tw": "像《魔獸世界》這種網路遊戲最令人滿足的就是能與他人合作一起獲得史詩般的勝利也是為什麼我們會花這麼多時間玩遊戲因為它比現實感受更好", "en": "Now, the problem with collaborativeonline environments like World of Warcraft is that it's so satisfying to beon the verge of an epic win all the time, we decide to spend all our timein these game worlds. It's just better than reality."}, {"zh-tw": "目前為止，《魔獸世界》的玩家總共花費了593萬年的時間去解决艾澤拉斯裡的各種虛擬問題這不是件壞事", "en": "So, so far, collectivelyall the World of Warcraft gamers have spent 5.93 million years solving the virtual problems of Azeroth. Now, that's not necessarily a bad thing."}, {"zh-tw": "雖然聽起來很糟但你要想想593萬年前我們的靈長類祖先開始直立行走", "en": "It might sound like it's a bad thing. But to put that in context: 5.93 million years ago was when our earliest primatehuman ancestors stood up."}, {"zh-tw": "成為第一種直立行走的靈長類動物所以，當我們講到花了多少時間玩電玩的時候，只要理性想想在人類進化過程中我們所花費的時間有多少相比之下是多麼可觀", "en": "That was the first upright primate. So when we talk about how much time we're currently investingin playing games, the only way it makes senseto even think about it is to talk about timeat the magnitude of human evolution, which is an extraordinary thing."}, {"zh-tw": "卻也合理，因為你會發現我們花這麼多時間玩遊戲反而漸漸改變了我們身為人類的能力我們不斷進化成更能合作，更友好的物種", "en": "But it's also apt, because it turns out that by spendingall this time playing games, we're actually changingwhat we are capable of as human beings. We're evolving to be a morecollaborative and hearty species."}, {"zh-tw": "這是真的，我如此深信看看這個有趣的數據是卡內基美隆大學一個研究員出版的在一個線上遊戲盛行的國家現今平均一個年輕人在21歲以前，玩線上遊戲的時間會是一萬小時", "en": "This is true. I believe this. So, consider this reallyinteresting statistic; it was recently published by a researcherat Carnegie Mellon University: The average young person todayin a country with a strong gamer culture will have spent 10,000 hoursplaying online games by the age of 21."}, {"zh-tw": "現在，一萬小時這數字很有趣是因為兩個原因首先，美國的兒童從五年級到高中畢業一個人將會花10080小時在學校上課前提是不翹課的話啦", "en": "Now 10,000 hours is a reallyinteresting number for two reasons. First of all, for childrenin the United States, 10,080 hours is the exact amountof time you will spend in school, from fifth gradeto high school graduation, if you have perfect attendance."}, {"zh-tw": "所以我們有了平行追蹤教育的數據年輕人學著當個好玩家所花的時間和他們在學校學習的時數是相同的你們有些人也許讀過Malcom Gladwell 的新書《局外人》你們聽過他對於成功的見解一萬小時的成功理論", "en": "So, we have an entireparallel track of education going on, where young people are learning as muchabout what it takes to be a good gamer as they're learningabout everything else in school. Some of you have probably readMalcolm Gladwell's new book \"Outliers,\" so you would have heardof his theory of success, the \"10,000 hours\" theory of success."}, {"zh-tw": "這理論是基於認知科學的研究：如果我們在21歲前花一萬小時專心的學習、專心做任何事，那麼我們便能在該領域獲得極大成就不管是哪個領域，我們都能成為世界頂尖", "en": "It's based on this greatcognitive-science research that says if we can master 10,000 hours of effortful study at anythingby the age of 21, we will be virtuosos at it. We will be as good at whatever we do as the greatest people in the world."}, {"zh-tw": "所以，我們正面對的是一整代年輕的頂尖玩家們最大的問題就是「玩家們擅長的到底是什麼？」如果我們能找出這答案就可以找出真正史無前例的人力資源", "en": "And so, now what we're looking at is an entire generation of young peoplewho are virtuoso gamers. So, the big question is, \"What exactly are gamersgetting so good at?\" Because if we could figure that out, we would have a virtually unprecedentedhuman resource on our hands."}, {"zh-tw": "這些是目前世界上每天至少花一小時玩線上遊戲的玩家他們都是頂尖玩家共五億人都擅長於某件事情", "en": "This is how many peoplewe now have in the world who spend at least an houra day playing online games. These are our virtuoso gamers, 500 million people who areextraordinarily good at something."}, {"zh-tw": "在接下來的十年裡會有另外十億玩家都擅長於另一個領域如果你還不知道，我告訴你，這正發生著", "en": "And in the next decade, we're going to have another billion gamers who are extraordinarilygood at whatever that is. If you don't know it already,this is coming."}, {"zh-tw": "遊戲產業一直在不停的發展低耗源、無線的手機網路，都取代了以往頻寬的網路介面讓全球的玩家，尤其來自印度、中國、巴西的玩家們，可以一起玩預測接下來十年裡，會多出十億玩家", "en": "The game industry is developing consoles that are low-energy and that workwith the wireless phone networks instead of broadband Internet, so that gamers all over the world, particularly in India, China,Brazil, can get online. They expect one billion moregamers in the next decade."}, {"zh-tw": "加上原本的五億，將達到15億玩家的數量所以我開始思考，到底什麼原因讓我們對遊戲這麼擅長", "en": "It will bring us up to 1.5 billion gamers. So I've started to think about what these gamesare making us virtuosos at."}, {"zh-tw": "我想到四個方面。首先就是無比的樂觀", "en": "Here are the four things I came up with. The first is urgent optimism."}, {"zh-tw": "把它想像成是極端的自我激勵無比的樂觀就是立刻解決阻礙的慾望加上想取得成功所持有的信念", "en": "OK, think of thisas extreme self-motivation. Urgent optimism is the desireto act immediately to tackle an obstacle, combined with the belief that we havea reasonable hope of success."}, {"zh-tw": "玩家們都相信，史詩般的勝利是辦得到的而且值得不斷嘗試玩家並不是閒坐在那", "en": "Gamers always believethat an epic win is possible, and that it's always worthtrying, and trying now. Gamers don't sit around."}, {"zh-tw": "他們很擅長組織緊密的社會連結一項有趣的調查顯示我們會更喜歡那些一起玩過遊戲的人即使他們把我們打敗的很慘", "en": "Gamers are virtuososat weaving a tight social fabric. There's a lot of interestingresearch that shows we like people betterafter we play a game with them, even if they've beaten us badly."}, {"zh-tw": "原因就是，在遊戲過程中我們對彼此累積了信任原因是，我們都花費相同的時間、遵守同樣的規則、擁有共同的目標，並肩作戰直到遊戲結束", "en": "And the reason is, it takes a lot of trustto play a game with someone. We trust that they will spendtheir time with us, that they will play by the same rules, value the same goal,stay with the game until it's over."}, {"zh-tw": "因此，一起參與遊戲是可以建立默契、信任和合作的進而能夠建立更強健的人際網路、", "en": "And so, playing a game together actually builds up bondsand trust and cooperation. And we actually build strongersocial relationships as a result."}, {"zh-tw": "幸福的生產力，我愛這詞《魔獸世界》的玩家，平均一星期花22小時在遊戲上是有原因的已經有點像在兼職了", "en": "Blissful productivity. I love it. You know, there's a reason whythe average World of Warcraft gamer plays for 22 hours a week --kind of a half-time job."}, {"zh-tw": "這是因為，在我們玩遊戲時和我們放鬆、玩樂時相比更努力地玩遊戲其實是更快樂的大家都知道，身為人類我們是有能力達成重大任務的", "en": "It's because we know,when we're playing a game, that we're actually happier working hard than we are relaxing, or hanging out.

He looks at why people are investingso much time and energy and money in online worlds."}, {"zh-tw": "他說：「我們目睹的是一大批人」「從現實世界中出走」「並走向虛擬世界、網路遊戲中」因為他是經濟學家，所以他是理性的他還說...不像我，我是個遊戲設計師，精力旺盛", "en": "And he says, \"We're witnessing what amounts tono less than a mass exodus to virtual worlds and onlinegame environments.\" And he's an economist, so he's rational. And he says -- Not like me, I'm a gamedesigner; I'm exuberant."}, {"zh-tw": "他還說這種情形是有跡可循的因為玩家在網路世界中達成的，比現實生活多他們在遊戲裡可以擁有比現實生活更好的人際關係他們所得到的回饋也比現實生活來的多", "en": "But he says that this makes perfect sense, because gamers can achievemore in online worlds than they can in real life. They can have strongersocial relationships in games than they can have in real life; they get better feedbackand feel more rewarded in games than they do in real life."}, {"zh-tw": "因此，他說對於玩家而言，他們會花費比現實生活還多的時間玩遊戲，是理所當然的好，我暫時同意這個理性觀點", "en": "So he says, for now it makes perfect sense for gamers to spend more timein virtual worlds than the real world. Now, I also agreethat that is rational, for now."}, {"zh-tw": "但是，無論如何，這不是最佳情況我們不得不開始把現實世界建構的像遊戲一樣", "en": "But it is not, by any means,an optimal situation.
