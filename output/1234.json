These are from the Daily Mail."}, {"zh-tw": "這類報紙一直都有個古怪、看似有理的企畫就是將世界上所有不會動的物件都分別歸類成致癌物或防癌物。", "en": "Every country in the worldhas a newspaper like this. It has this bizarre,ongoing philosophical project of dividing all the inanimateobjects in the world into the ones that either causeor prevent cancer."}, {"zh-tw": "這些是一部分最近據說會致癌的玩意兒離婚、無線網路、衛生用品和咖啡而這些則是據說能防癌的東西麵包皮、紅椒、甘草和咖啡", "en": "Here are some of the thingsthey said cause cancer: divorce, Wi-Fi, toiletries and coffee.

Coffee both causes and prevents cancer."}, {"zh-tw": "當你開始讀下去，你會發現這些報導說不定別有用心。拿女性來說，做家事能預防乳癌但對男性而言，購物會使他們性無能所以，我們要開始", "en": "As you start to read on, you can see that maybe there's somepolitical valence behind some of this. For women, houseworkprevents breast cancer, but for men, shoppingcould make you impotent."}, {"zh-tw": "揭露這一切背後的科學真相我想要做的是揭穿那些騙人的說法以及那些假象背後的證據，這並非卑鄙、催毛求疵的事這對社會有用，", "en": "So we know that we need to startunpicking the science behind this. And what I hope to show is that unpickingthe evidence behind dodgy claims isn't a kind of nasty, carping activity; it's socially useful."}, {"zh-tw": "同時，也是個極具價值的解說工具。因為真正的科學是批判地評斷他人提出的證據這就是在學術期刊，以及學術研討論上，上演的戲碼。有時在發言完後的問答時間就像場血戰。", "en": "But it's also an extremely valuableexplanatory tool, because real science is aboutcritically appraising the evidence for somebody else's position. That's what happens in academic journals, it's what happensat academic conferences -- the Q&amp;A session after a postdocpresents data is often a bloodbath."}, {"zh-tw": "但沒人在乎，我們還熱烈歡迎。就像是雙方同意，來場學術上的激烈性愛一樣。所以，接下來要讓各位看的", "en": "And nobody minds that;we actively welcome it.

This is from Britain's \"leading\"diet nutritionist in the Daily Mirror, our second-biggest selling newspaper."}, {"zh-tw": "「2001年，澳洲當地的實驗發現若把橄欖油與水果、蔬菜，或豆類植物搭配食用，將對皮膚防皺有相當顯著效果。」然後，他們就給妳這樣的建議：「如果把橄欖油及蔬菜搭配著吃，你的皺紋會比較少。」他們也很熱心地告訴你文獻出處而在你看完報告後，你就會知道這是份觀測研究很顯然地，沒人有辦法回到1930年把同個產科所有出生的小孩找來其中一半給他們吃水果、蔬菜和橄欖油另一半給他們吃麥當勞之後，看他們的皺紋誰多誰少", "en": "\"An Australian study in 2001found that olive oil, in combination with fruits,vegetables and pulses, offers measurable protectionagainst skin wrinklings,\" and give the advice: \"If you eat olive oil and vegetables,you'll have fewer wrinkles.\" They helpfully tell youhow to find the paper, and what you findis an observational study. Obviously, nobody has been ableto go back to 1930, get all the people bornin one maternity unit, and half of them eat lotsof fruit and veg and olive oil, half of them eat McDonald's, and then we see how many wrinklesyou've got later."}, {"zh-tw": "你得拍照記錄人們的樣子當然，你會發現到吃蔬菜和橄欖油的人，確實皺紋較少", "en": "You have to take a snapshotof how people are now. And what you find is, of course: people who eat veg and olive oilhave fewer wrinkles."}, {"zh-tw": "但，這是因為那些吃水果、蔬菜，橄欖油的人是怪胎他們不正常，就像你們一樣他們會出席TED這樣的活動他們受歡迎、有錢、也不太可能做室外工作也不太從事勞力的工作他們在社會上獲得較多的支持，他們不太抽菸－因此，這麼多關於社會、政治，文化等等原因，這些原因這麼棒，又如此環環相扣而這些人，也就不太可能有皺紋", "en": "But that's because people who eatfruit and veg and olive oil are freaks -- they're not normal, they're like you;they come to events like this. They're posh, they're wealthy,less likely to have outdoor jobs, less likely to do manual labor, they have better social support,are less likely to smoke; for a host of fascinating, interlocking social, political and cultural reasons, they're less likely to have wrinkles."}, {"zh-tw": "這並不意味著蔬菜還是橄欖油的功勞所以，做實驗往往是最理想的選擇", "en": "That doesn't meanit's the vegetables or olive oil. So ideally, what you wantto do is a trial."}, {"zh-tw": "大家都認為，他們對於實驗都得很熟實驗是個老話題。第一個是出現在聖經－但以理書，第一章十二節", "en": "People think they're familiarwith the idea of a trial. Trials are old; the first onewas in the Bible, Daniel 1:12."}, {"zh-tw": "這試驗很簡單，你找一群人，把他們分兩組這兩組人，你都用不同的方法去對待他們過了一下子之後你就看會他們會發生什麼事", "en": "It's straightforward: take a bunchof people, split them in half, treat one group one way,the other group, the other way. A while later, you seewhat happened to each of them."}, {"zh-tw": "現在我要和你說的這個試驗在過去十年的英國新聞媒體報導中可以算是名聲相當不錯的試驗這是個魚肝油的試驗", "en": "I'm going to tell you about one trial, which is probablythe most well-reported trial in the UK news media over the past decade. This is the trial of fish oil pills."}, {"zh-tw": "魚肝油宣稱，可以改善大部分小孩的學業表現及學校行為他們說：「我們做了個試驗", "en": "The claim: fish oil pills improveschool performance and behavior in mainstream children. They said, \"We did a trial."}, {"zh-tw": "而之前的試驗結果都是好的，我想我們的也會是好的。」會這樣說，就是個警訊當你已經知道實驗的結果，那還做它幹什麼無論這試驗只是隨意起草或是你已有充分的數據，而你已不需要隨機挑選更多的試驗者", "en": "All the previous ones were positive,this one will be too.\" That should ring alarm bells: if you know the answer to your trial,you shouldn't be doing one. Either you've rigged it by design, or you've got enough data so there'sno need to randomize people anymore."}, {"zh-tw": "實驗就是這樣進行的他們找了三千位孩童並給孩童吃很多的魚肝油一天吃六顆一年後，他們來測量孩童的學業表現並把得來的結果和這些孩童沒有吃魚肝油的預期結果來兩相比較有人現在看出這實驗設計的缺失了嗎？所有臨床試驗方法的教授都不準回答這問題", "en": "So this is what they were goingto do in their trial: They were taking 3,000 children, they were going to give them these hugefish oil pills, six of them a day, and then, a year later, measuretheir school exam performance and compare their performance against what they predictedtheir exam performance would have been if they hadn't had the pills. Now, can anybody spota flaw in this design? And no professorsof clinical trial methodology are allowed to answer this question."}, {"zh-tw": "這實驗沒有對照組聽起來像電子迷才會做的事那是一個專業術語", "en": "So there's no control group. But that sounds really techie, right?That's a technical term."}, {"zh-tw": "孩童吃了魚肝油，他們的學業表現進步了除了魚肝油，還有什麼其它的原因嗎?他們隨著時間長大了", "en": "The kids got the pills,and their performance improved. What else could it possiblybe if it wasn't the pills? They got older; we all develop over time."}, {"zh-tw": "當然，還有安慰劑的影響安慰劑的效果是所有藥品中，最令人神往的一個不是吃藥而已，然後你的表現變好，疼痛舒緩如此而已是我們的信念，以及期望這就是治療的文化定譯", "en": "And of course, there's the placebo effect, one of the most fascinating thingsin the whole of medicine. It's not just taking a pilland performance or pain improving; it's about our beliefs and expectations,the cultural meaning of a treatment."}, {"zh-tw": "許多很好的研究也和安慰劑的效果做了對照實驗舉例來說，一天吃兩顆糖的人較不容易得到胃潰瘍和吃一顆糖的人相比", "en": "And this has been demonstratedin a whole raft of fascinating studies comparing one kind of placeboagainst another. So we know, for example, that two sugar pills a dayare a more effective treatment for gastric ulcers than one sugar pill."}, {"zh-tw": "一天吃兩顆糖比吃一顆糖更有用儘管這個發現讓人覺得奇怪又好笑，但這是事實", "en": "Two sugar pills a day beats one a day. That's an outrageousand ridiculous finding, but it's true."}, {"zh-tw": "從三種不同疼痛的研究當中，我們瞭解注射生理食鹽水來治療疼痛，是個較有效的方法，相較於吃糖果，安慰劑...等等沒有任何藥品成分的東西而這並非是注射或吃藥對生體產生了什麼影響而是人們覺得注射是種更強力的手段我們曉得自己的信念，期待是可被操控的這也為什麼我們做實驗時需要拿安慰劑來對照一半的人接受真正的治療另一半的人則使用安慰劑", "en": "We know from three different studieson three different types of pain that a saltwater injectionis a more effective treatment than a sugar pill, a dummy pillwith no medicine in it, not because the injection or pillsdo anything physically to the body, but because an injection feelslike a much more dramatic intervention. So we know that our beliefsand expectations can be manipulated, which is why we do trialswhere we control against a placebo, where one half of the peopleget the real treatment, and the other half get placebo."}, {"zh-tw": "但，這樣是不夠的目前為止，我給你們看的實驗例子的方法，都很簡單易懂簡單到記者、食物供應商、糖果小販以及自然療法醫生都可以根據他們自己的目的，來曲解證據", "en": "But that's not enough. What I've just shown you are examples of the very simpleand straightforward ways that journalists and food supplementpill peddlers and naturopaths can distort evidencefor their own purposes."}, {"zh-tw": "令我相當驚訝的是那些醫藥工業他們使用相同的方法、設備只不過把證據扭曲成較複雜的版本而醫生及病人，都根據那些扭曲的證據做出攸關性命的重要決定首先，大家都認為一個和安慰劑對照的實驗，應該是拿新藥品和安慰劑來相比較", "en": "What I find really fascinating is that the pharmaceutical industryuses exactly the same kinds of tricks and devices, but slightly more sophisticatedversions of them, in order to distort the evidencethey give to doctors and patients, and which we use to makevitally important decisions. So firstly, trials against placebo: everybody thinks a trialshould be a comparison of your new drug against placebo."}, {"zh-tw": "但，在很多情況下，這樣的方法是錯的因為，我們通常已經有了一個可行的良好療法我們就不需要知道那可有可無的替代療法我們想知道的是，替代療法是否比現行的最佳療法更好", "en": "But in a lot of situations that's wrong; often, we already have a good treatmentcurrently available. So we don't want to knowthat your alternative new treatment is better than nothing, but that it's better than the bestavailable treatment we have."}, {"zh-tw": "然而，你卻看到人們一再地拿安慰劑來對照做實驗只要你得到許可證，你的藥品就可以上市藥品背後的數據，證明這種藥物可有可無對一個像我這樣需要做決定的醫生來說是沒有任何用處的而這不是唯一可以扭曲數據的方法", "en": "And yet, repeatedly, you consistentlysee people doing trials still against placebo. And you can get licensedto bring your drug to market with only data showingthat it's better than nothing, which is useless for a doctor like metrying to make a decision."}, {"zh-tw": "你還可以把和新藥品要比較的物品弄得像垃圾一樣毫無價值", "en": "But that's not the only wayyou can rig your data. You can also rig your data by making the thing you compareyour new drug against really rubbish."}, {"zh-tw": "在使用競爭者的藥品時，你也可以只給予很少的劑量，而人們自然沒有辦法治療好或是你把劑量提高這樣就會產生副作用", "en": "You can give the competing drugin too low a dose, so people aren't properly treated. You can give the competing drugin too high a dose, so people get side effects."}, {"zh-tw": "而這正是發生在治療人格分裂症的抗精神病療程的事情二十年前，從國外引進了一批新的抗精神病藥物這些藥物都保證副作用比現有的藥物還少", "en": "And this is exactly what happened with antipsychotic medicationfor schizophrenia. Twenty years ago, a new generationof antipsychotic drugs were brought in; the promise was they would havefewer side effects."}, {"zh-tw": "所以人們就開始拿這些新的藥物和舊的藥物做實驗比較但，他們卻把舊的藥物劑量提高很多－一天要吃20毫克的施寧錠(抗精神病藥物)", "en": "So people set about doing trialsof the new drugs against the old drugs. But they gave the old drugsin ridiculously high doses: 20 milligrams a day of haloperidol."}, {"zh-tw": "結論可想而知要是你把一種藥物的劑量開這麼高它的副作用當然比新的藥物還要多過去十年，歷史不斷重演。有趣的是當那一批抗精神病藥品，像是理思必妥產權到期時，人人都可以自己做這些藥物", "en": "And it's a foregone conclusionif you give a drug at that high a dose, it will have more side effects,and your new drug will look better. Ten years ago, history repeated itself, when risperidone, the firstof the new-generation antipsychotic drugs, came off copyright,so anybody could make copies."}, {"zh-tw": "大家想證明，他們自己做的藥比理思必妥還好所以你會看到，有一堆的抗精神病藥物拿來和一天八毫克的理思必妥做比較八毫克不是多得很瘋狂，也沒有超出合法劑量但幾乎游走在法律邊緣了", "en": "Everybody wanted to show their drugwas better than risperidone, so you see trials comparingnew antipsychotic drugs against risperidoneat eight milligrams a day. Again, not an insane dose,not an illegal dose, but very much at the high end of normal."}, {"zh-tw": "所以，你自己做的藥物當然比那些藥來的好果不其然藥商贊助的實驗比那些獨立出資的實驗，得到陽性結果機率高出四倍", "en": "So you're bound to makeyour new drug look better. And so it's no surprise that overall, industry-funded trialsare four times more likely to give a positive result than independently sponsored trials."}, {"zh-tw": "但是，但但但但是最後卻發現那些藥商贊助實驗所使用的方法確實是比獨立出資的實驗要來的好儘管如此，他們仍設法去得到他們想要的結果", "en": "But -- and it's a big but -- it turns out, when you look at the methodsused by industry-funded trials, that they're actually betterthan independently sponsored trials. And yet, they always manageto get the result that they want."}, {"zh-tw": "怎麼做？這樣如此奇怪的現象該如何解釋？原來，那些負面的數據在實驗進行中被隱匿起來。醫生和病人都不知情而這正是整件事情的重點所在證據都在這裡", "en": "So how does this work? How can we explainthis strange phenomenon? Well, it turns out that what happens is the negative datagoes missing in action; it's withheld from doctors and patients. And this is the most importantaspect of the whole story."}, {"zh-tw": "任一特定的療法，我們需要所有的資訊來知道該療法是否有效而有兩種不同的方法可以讓你知道", "en": "It's at the topof the pyramid of evidence. We need to have all of the dataon a particular treatment to know whether or notit really is effective."}, {"zh-tw": "是否有數據在實驗中不見了妳可以用統計數字，或是實例", "en": "There are two different ways you can spotwhether some data has gone missing. You can use statisticsor you can use stories."}, {"zh-tw": "我個人偏好統計數字，所以我先講這個這個圖表叫做漏斗圖", "en": "I prefer statistics,so that's what I'll do first. This is a funnel plot."}, {"zh-tw": "漏斗圖的設計非常聰明要是有少量的負面結果不見的話，你會看得出來這圖表上，就是針對某一種醫療法的所有實驗", "en": "A funnel plot is a very cleverway of spotting if small negative trials have disappeared,have gone missing in action. This is a graph of all of the trials doneon a particular treatment."}, {"zh-tw": "隨著你接近圖表的頂端你看到的每一個點，都是一個實驗越往上看，那些實驗規模越大，也就越少出錯也就是越少隨便的假陽性效果、假的陰性效果", "en": "As you go up towards the top of the graph, what you see is each dot is a trial. As you go up, those are bigger trials,so they've got less error; they're less likely to be randomly falsepositives or negatives."}, {"zh-tw": "他們全聚在一塊規模較大的實驗，都較接近事實", "en": "So they all cluster together. The big trials are closerto the true answer."}, {"zh-tw": "而你越往底部看你就會看到捏造的假陰性結果而另一邊，你也是看到捏造的假陽性結果要是有發表篇倚(有統計同的結果更容易被發表)或是少量的負面結果在過程中消失你在這些圖表都會看到", "en": "Then as you go further down at the bottom, what you can see is, on this side,spurious false negatives, and over on this side,spurious false positives. If there is publication bias, if small negative trialshave gone missing in action, you can see it on one of these graphs."}, {"zh-tw": "所以，那些本該在左下角的負面結果全都消失了這圖表展示的，是關於發表篇倚的研究中所出現的發表篇倚", "en": "So you see herethat the small negative trials that should be on the bottom lefthave disappeared. This is a graph demonstratingthe presence of publication bias in studies of publication bias."}, {"zh-tw": "我認為那是個流行病學的笑話，而且，我想這是你聽過的笑話中最好笑的一個剛剛說的，就是說明該如何透過統記證明那麼實例呢？", "en": "And I think that's the funniestepidemiology joke you will ever hear. That's how you can prove it statistically."}, {"zh-tw": "實例就比較可惡了，真的很可惡。這藥叫做瑞波西汀（抗憂鬱劑）", "en": "But what about stories? Well, they're heinous, they really are. This is a drug called reboxetine."}, {"zh-tw": "我過去曾開過這種藥給病人而我是個蠻書呆子的醫生", "en": "This is a drug which I, myself,have prescribed to patients. And I'm a very nerdy doctor."}, {"zh-tw": "我盡力去嘗試閱讀，並瞭解所有的文獻我看了這些實驗，他們都是陽性的，也都進行得很好", "en": "I hope I go out of my way to try and read and understandall the literature. I read the trials on this."}, {"zh-tw": "我沒發現什麼缺失", "en": "They were all positive,all well-conducted. I found no flaw."}, {"zh-tw": "不幸地是許多實驗並沒有公布出來事實上，有76%關於這項藥品的實驗並沒有讓醫生或是病人知道", "en": "Unfortunately, it turned out,that many of these trials were withheld. In fact, 76 percent of all of the trialsthat were done on this drug were withheld from doctors and patients."}, {"zh-tw": "現在，請你想一想要是我擲一枚銅板一百次而其中有一半的答案我都不和你說那麼，我就有辦法說服你這枚銅板兩面都是人頭若我們刪除一半的數據那我們永遠都不曉得，這些藥品實際的效果為何", "en": "Now if you think about it, if I tossed a coin a hundred times, and I'm allowed to withhold from youthe answers half the times, then I can convince youthat I have a coin with two heads. If we remove half of the data, we can never know what the trueeffect size of these medicines is."}, {"zh-tw": "而這類的實例都是息息相關的大約有一半抗憂鬱藥物的實驗至今仍未公佈甚至還超出一半", "en": "And this is not an isolated story. Around half of all of the trial dataon antidepressants has been withheld, but it goes way beyond that."}, {"zh-tw": "而科克倫小組，正致力於獲得那些數據來整合所有的事情科克倫小組是個國際性，非營利的合作機構他們有系統地提供過去的數據回顧", "en": "The Nordic Cochrane Group were tryingto get ahold of the data on that to bring it all together. The Cochrane Groups are an internationalnonprofit collaboration that produce systematic reviews of all of the datathat has ever been shown."}, {"zh-tw": "而他們需要管道，來獲得所有的數據但這些公司不讓他們知道那些數據", "en": "And they need to have accessto all of the trial data.

This is a problem that is currentlylacking a solution."}, {"zh-tw": "要讓你們知道問題的嚴重性。來看看克流感世界上許多政府花了數十億的金錢在克流感上這些政府都承諾克流感可以降低流感併發症的比率", "en": "And to show how big it goes,this is a drug called Tamiflu, which governments around the world have spent billionsand billions of dollars on. And they spend that moneyon the promise that this is a drug which will reduce the rateof complications with flu."}, {"zh-tw": "我們既有的數據顯示克流感是降低流感的持續時間幾小時但我不在乎這個，政府也不在乎", "en": "We already have the data showing it reduces the durationof your flu by a few hours. But I don't care about that,governments don't care."}, {"zh-tw": "如果你得到流感，我很抱歉，我知道那很難受但，我們絕不會花了幾十億只是要去縮短流感症狀的持續時間而已還只減少個半天左右我們會開這些藥，也會貯存他們為了緊急狀況", "en": "I'm sorry if you have the flu,I know it's horrible, but we're not going to spendbillions of dollars trying to reduce the durationof your flu symptoms by half a day.
