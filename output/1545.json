MO: The tools."}, {"zh-tw": "MO: 首先是工具。大型的救助組織都很擅長在災難後補給大量的資源不過通常他們完成特定任務以後就會離開了留下當地居民去處理眾多志工、大量的捐贈物資但當地居民未經訓練，也缺乏工具", "en": "Large aid organizations are exceptionalat bringing massive resources to bear after a disaster, but they often fulfill very specificmissions, and then they leave. This leaves local residents to deal withthe thousands of spontaneous volunteers, thousands of donations, and all with no training and no tools."}, {"zh-tw": "因此他們用即時貼、或者 Excel 或者 Facebook但沒有工具可以讓你區別出首要的資訊，並加以重視在當中全是照片和一些祝福CO: 第二是時間的把握", "en": "So they use Post-its or Excel or Facebook. But none of these tools allow youto value high-priority information amidst all of the photos and well-wishes."}, {"zh-tw": "災難救助其實是一個反過來的政治競選的過程", "en": "CO: The timing. Disaster relief is essentiallya backwards political campaign."}, {"zh-tw": "在一場政治選舉中，你從零開始，在毫無利益和能力的境況中付諸行動你逐漸地開始發展直到在選舉當中你這兩種能力帶到了最高點", "en": "In a political campaign,you start with no interest and no capacity to turn that into action. You build both gradually, until a moment of peak mobilizationat the time of the election."}, {"zh-tw": "在一個災難當中呢，你開始是有各種利益但是沒有能力而你只有七天去獲取百分之五十的網絡搜索以拯救你那片區域", "en": "In a disaster, however,you start with all of the interest and none of the capacity. And you've only got about seven days to capture 50 percent of allof the Web searches that will ever be made to help your area."}, {"zh-tw": "然後一些體育事件發生了你只有你目前收集到的資源去完成五年後所需的重建工作這是一個 Katrina 的幻燈片", "en": "Then some sporting event happens, and you've got only the resourcesthat you've collected thus far to meet the next five yearsof recovery needs. This is the slide for Katrina."}, {"zh-tw": "這是 Joplin 的曲線這個是在四月我們部署軟體時候對於達拉斯颶風的一個曲線", "en": "This is the curve for Joplin. And this is the curvefor the Dallas tornadoes in April, where we deployed software."}, {"zh-tw": "這有個缺口受災戶必須等著保險公司的理算員來之後他們的房產才能獲得幫助", "en": "There's a gap here. Affected households have to waitfor the insurance adjuster to visit before they can start accepting helpon their properties."}, {"zh-tw": "而且你在達拉斯只有4天的時間MO: 最後一個是數據", "en": "And you've only got about four daysof interest in Dallas. MO: Data."}, {"zh-tw": "數據本來是沒什麼意思的不過對於一個區域的恢復可是很有效率FEMA (譯者注:Federal Emergency Management Agency 美國聯邦緊急事件管理局) 和州會對一個聯邦認證的災難付款百分之 85 的損失然後剩下 %15 就留給城鎮自己去支付", "en": "Data is inherently unsexy, but it can jump-start an area's recovery. FEMA and the state will pay85 percent of the cost of a federally-declared disaster, leaving the town to paythe last 15 percent of the bill."}, {"zh-tw": "開銷可以變得非常昂貴但如果這個城鎮可以召集 X 個志願者去服務 Y 個小時這批勞動力帶來的美元價值直接就到城鎮的貢獻中去不過誰知道呢?現在，想像一下當你送出去 2000 志願者但你無法證明的感覺是什麼樣", "en": "Now that expense can be huge, but if the town can mobilize X amountof volunteers for Y hours, the dollar value of that labor usedgoes toward the town's contribution. But who knows that? Now try to imaginethe sinking feeling you get when you've just sent out 2,000 volunteersand you can't prove it."}, {"zh-tw": "CO: 這三個問題都可以用一個方案來解決 (譯者總結: 工具、時間把握、數據)如果我們能在正確的時間內得到對的工具送到那些可以站出來然後重建社區的人們手中我們就可以在災難恢復中創造新的標準", "en": "CO: These are three problemswith a common solution. If we can get the right toolsat the right time to the people who will inevitably step up and start puttingtheir communities back together, we can create new standardsin disaster recovery."}, {"zh-tw": "MO: 我們需要監控工具，為捐贈品建立數據庫需要回報和遠程聯繫志願者所有都在一個簡單的網站當中CO: 我們還需要幫助", "en": "MO: We needed canvasing tools,donations databasing, needs reporting, remote volunteer access, all in an easy-to-use website. CO: And we needed help."}, {"zh-tw": "我們的軟件工程師和投資人 Alvin 已經造好了這些工具Chris 和 Bill 已經用他們志願的時間去運作和尋找合作夥伴", "en": "Alvin, our software engineerand co-founder, has built these tools. Chris and Bill have volunteered their timeto use operations and partnerships."}, {"zh-tw": "而我們一直在拜訪那些有災難的地區建立軟件，訓練當地居民然後給軟體授權給各個地區，從而他們可以為救災做準備MO: 其中第一個就是在這個四月 Dallas 的颶風之後", "en": "And we've been flying into disaster areassince this past January, setting up software, training residents and licensing the software to areasthat are preparing for disasters. MO: One of our first launcheswas after the Dallas tornadoes this past April."}, {"zh-tw": "我們到了一個有著過時網站和瘋狂 Facebook帳戶的城鎮於是我們建立了平臺所有的利益在前 4 天就來了但是當他們丟掉了新聞圈的時候，我們就有更多的需要但是他們有這一大批人們捐助的資源因此他們可以滿足人們的需要CO: 因此運作的很好，不過可以更好一點", "en": "We flew into a townthat had a static, outdated website and a frenetic Facebook feed,trying to structure the response, and we launched our platform. All of the interest camein the first four days, but by the time they lost the news cycle, that's when the needs came in, yet they had this massive resourceof what people were able to give and they've been able to meetthe needs of their residents."}, {"zh-tw": "對於緊急的準備是在災難恢復中很重要的因為它使得一個城鎮更安全和更有彈性", "en": "CO: So it's working,but it could be better. Emergency preparedness is a big dealin disaster recovery because it makes towns saferand more resilient."}, {"zh-tw": "想像一下在災難之前我們可以把所有這些系統都建立好因此這就我們在工作的東西", "en": "Imagine if we could havethese systems ready to go in a place before a disaster. So that's what we're working on."}, {"zh-tw": "我們想把這些軟體帶到人們那裡去，這些他們可以做出判斷，知道怎麼用可以被提前安置好就是一點點資訊就可以使得重建工作得以運轉MO: 這不是什麼晦澀的火箭科學", "en": "We're working on getting the softwareto places so people expect it, so people know how to use it and so it can be filled ahead of time with that micro-informationthat drives recovery. MO: It's not rocket science."}, {"zh-tw": "這些工具都是人們想要的在我們家鄉，我們訓練了 6 個居民去讓他們自己去使用網路工具因為 Caitria 和我在波士頓住", "en": "These tools are obviousand people want them. In our hometown,we trained a half-dozen residents to run these Web tools on their own, because Caitria and Ilive here, in Boston."}, {"zh-tw": "他們都立即使用了這個現在他們是自發的團隊力量有三組志願者幾乎每天都工作自從去年的六月一日他們保證這些居民得到他們所需要並且順利回到家中", "en": "They took to it immediately,and now they are forces of nature. There are over three volunteer groupsworking almost every day, and have been since June 1 of last year, to make sure these residents get whatthey need and get back in their homes."}, {"zh-tw": "他們有電話熱線、記錄單、和數據CO: 這才起到了決定性的效果", "en": "They have hotlinesand spreadsheets and data. CO: And that makes a difference."}, {"zh-tw": "今年6月1日代表了 Monson 颶風的一週年而我們的社區從沒有這麼緊密連結、並且同時賦予力量過我們能夠看到同樣的改變在德州和亞拉巴馬州", "en": "June 1 this year marked the one-yearanniversary of the Monson tornado, and our community's never beenmore connected or more empowered. We've been able to see the sametransformation in Texas and in Alabama."}, {"zh-tw": "因為這不需要哈佛或者麻省理工學院在災難過後飛到那裡去處理問題只需要當地人們去弄不管一個救援組織多麼好他們最終還是得回家", "en": "Because it doesn't take Harvard or MIT to fly in and fix problemsafter a disaster; it takes a local. No matter how good an aid organizationis at what they do, they eventually have to go home."}, {"zh-tw": "但是你如果把工具交給當地人民你展示給他們如果去恢復重建他們就成了專家(鼓掌) MO: 好吧，那我們走吧。(鼓掌)", "en": "But if you give locals the tools, if you show themwhat they can do to recover, they become experts. MO: All right. Let's go."}], "title": "Caitria And Morgan O Neill How To Step Up In The Face Of Disaster"}
