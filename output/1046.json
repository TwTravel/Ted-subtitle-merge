I will say though that,after having done surgery a lot, it's similar to playinga musical instrument."}, {"zh-tw": "而對於我來說，正是這種深刻而持久的聲音魅力，吸引著我在做一個手術醫師的同時，學習研究聲音的科學，特別是音樂。那麼，在下面的幾分鐘裡，我將試著跟你們談論關於我的職業特別在於我究竟是如何研究音樂以及努力設法解決這些關於大腦如何產生創意的疑問。", "en": "And for me, this deepand enduring fascination with sound is what led me to both be a surgeon and to study the scienceof sound, particularly music. I'm going to talkover the next few minutes about my career in terms of how I'm able to study music and try to grapplewith all these questions of how the brain is able to be creative."}, {"zh-tw": "這些工作大部分是我在約翰·霍普金斯大學時候完成的，也有一些是我之前在美國國家健康研究中心做的。我會先回顧一下一些科學實驗並且會涉及三個音樂實驗。", "en": "I've done most of this workat Johns Hopkins University, and at the National Instituteof Health where I was previously. I'll go over some science experimentsand cover three musical experiments."}, {"zh-tw": "我想從給你們展示一段影片開始。這是基斯·哈雷特的一段影片， 他是一位著名的爵士即興音樂創作人，並且可能是最著名的，能將即興創作提升到一個相當高水平且最具代表性的人物。", "en": "I will start off by playinga video for you. This video is of Keith Jarrett,who's a well-known jazz improviser and probably the mostwell-known, iconic example of someone who takes improvisationto a higher level."}, {"zh-tw": "並且，他將用他的大腦創作出整場音樂會，並且他將永遠不會再用一模一樣的方式表演。因此， 以一種極高度的創作形式來說，我想這是一個非常好的例子。所以現在讓我們來看看這段影片吧。", "en": "And he'll improvise entire concertsoff the top of his head, and he'll never play itexactly the same way again, so as a form of intense creativity, I think this is a great example. And so why don't we goand click the video."}, {"zh-tw": "（音樂）剛剛發生的一切真是非凡而美妙。一直以來 -- 我只是一個聆聽者，一個樂迷 --我聽著，然後我被震懾住了。", "en": "(Music) (Music ends) It's really a remarkablething that happens there. I've always as a listener, as a fan, I listen to that, and I'm astounded."}, {"zh-tw": "我想：這怎麼可能發生？大腦怎麼能自行產生那麼多的信息，那麼多的音樂?所以，我合乎科學地展開這個概念，具有藝術性的創作，它是神奇的，但它不是魔術。意思是說，它是大腦的產物。沒有很多的腦死亡者在創作藝術。", "en": "I think -- how can this possibly be? How can the brain generatethat much information, that much music, spontaneously? And so I set outwith this concept, scientifically, that artistic creativity,it's magical, but it's not magic, meaning that it's a product of the brain. There's not too many brain-deadpeople creating art."}, {"zh-tw": "所以基與這種理念，那藝術性的創作實際上是一種神經產物，我帶來了這個議題，我們可以來研究一下，就像我們可以研究別的複雜的神經過程一樣。並且， 我覺得還有一些我放在那裡的小問題。真的有可能用科學的方法研究創造力嗎？我認為這是個很好的問題。", "en": "With this notion that artistic creativityis in fact a neurologic product, I took this thesis that we could study it just like we study any othercomplex neurologic process, and there are subquestionsthat I put there. Is it possible to studycreativity scientifically? And I think that's a good question."}, {"zh-tw": "我要告訴你們，大部分針對音樂所做的科學研究，它們非常難以理解。當你閱讀它們時，很難從中辦識音樂。實際上，它們整個看上去非常的不具音樂性。而且完全失去了音樂的特性。", "en": "And I'll tell you that mostscientific studies of music, they're very dense, and when you go through them, it's very hard to recognizethe music in it. In fact, they seem to beunmusical entirely and to miss the point of the music."}, {"zh-tw": "因此，這就帶來了第二個問題：為什麼科學家們要研究創造力呢？也許我們並不是研究音樂的正確人選。但也有可能我們是。但是，我將要說，從一個科學的角度 ——當今我們談論很多關於創新的事情。科學創新。我們對大腦如何可以創新的認知還只是初級。是的，我們對我們如何可以創新知之甚少。", "en": "This brings the second question: Why should scientists study creativity? Maybe we're not the right people to do it. Well it may be, but I will say that,from a scientific perspective, we talked a lot about innovation today, the science of innovation, how much we understandabout how the brain is able to innovate is in its infancy, and truly, we know very littleabout how we are able to be creative."}, {"zh-tw": "所以，我想，我們將看到再過10年，20年，30年一種關於創造力的真實科學將會迅速發展，並且繁榮興旺。因為現在有新的方法使得我們可以運用這些類似的過程，像複雜的爵士即興表演，嚴僅地研究它讓它一直深入到大腦。", "en": "I think that we're going to see, over the next 10, 20, 30 years, a real science of creativitythat's burgeoning and is going to flourish, Because we now have new methodsthat can enable us to take this processlike complex jazz improvisation, and study it rigorously. So it gets down to the brain."}, {"zh-tw": "這樣以後我們都可以擁有這個非凡的大腦，而現在我們對大腦只有差強人意的認識。我想，神經學家們的問題可能比答案還多。而我自己，我今天將不會給你們很多的解答。我只問大量的問題。", "en": "All of us have this remarkable brain, which is poorly understood,to say the least. I think that neuroscientistshave more questions than answers, and I'm not goingto give you answers today, just ask a lot of questions."}, {"zh-tw": "基本上，這正是我每天在實驗室作的事情。我會問很多問題，關於我們的大腦做了什麼才使得我們可以做這做那。", "en": "And that's what I do in my lab. I ask questions about what is the braindoing to enable us to do this."}, {"zh-tw": "這就是我用的主要方法。 這種方法叫功能磁共振影像。如果你有在磁共振影像掃描儀中待過，基本上是相同的東西，但這一個被裝備成一種特別的方式它不僅能為你的腦部拍照，還為腦部的活動區域拍照。", "en": "This is the main method that I use.This is functional MRI. If you've been in an MRI scanner,it's very much the same, but this one is outfitted in a special wayto not just take pictures of your brain, but to also take picturesof active areas of the brain."}, {"zh-tw": "下面就是這個方法的實現：這是一種叫血氧影像的東西，是血和氧氣水平的影像。當你處在一個功能磁共振影像掃描儀中時，你是在一個巨大的磁場中將你局部區域的分子排列起來。", "en": "The way that's done is by the following: There's something called BOLD imaging, which is Blood OxygenLevel Dependent imaging. When you're in an fMRI scanner,you're in a big magnet that's aligning your moleculesin certain areas."}, {"zh-tw": "當大腦的某塊區域在活動，也就是說一塊神經區域在活動的時候，它使血流轉到那塊區域。血流造成那塊區域的血量增加它改變脫氧血紅蛋白的濃度。", "en": "When an area of the brain is active,meaning a neural area is active, it gets blood flow shunted to that area. That blood flow causes an increasein local blood to that area with a deoxyhemoglobinchange in concentration."}, {"zh-tw": "去氧合血紅蛋白可以被磁共振成像探測到，而氧基红血球素不能被探測到。所以通過這種推斷 ——並且我們在測量血流，而不是神經活動——我們稱之為大腦某個血量正在增加的區域在某特別的任務中是活動的。那就是功能磁共振成像的工作原理的關鍵之處。", "en": "Deoxyhemoglobin can be detected by MRI, whereas oxyhemoglobin can't. So through this method of inference -- and we're measuring blood flow,not neural activity -- we say that an area of the brainthat's getting more blood was active during a particular task,and that's the crux of how fMRI works."}, {"zh-tw": "而它從90年代以來就被用來研究相當複雜的過程。現在我將來回顧一下我自己做的一個研究，這個研究是關於功能磁共振掃描儀中的爵士樂。", "en": "And it's been used since the '90sto study really complex processes. I'm going to review a study that I did,which was jazz in an fMRI scanner."}, {"zh-tw": "這是我和我的一個同事，亞倫·布勞恩，在美國國家健康研究中心時做的。這是一個我們如何進行這個項目的短片。", "en": "It was done with a colleague,Alan Braun, at the NIH. This is a short videoof how we did this project."}, {"zh-tw": "（視頻）查爾斯·理姆：這是一個塑料的MIDI （音樂設備數字接口）鋼琴鍵盤我們用這個鍵盤來進行爵士樂實驗。它是一塊35鍵的鍵盤這樣設計是爲了同時適合掃描儀內部，同時安全地帶著磁性，將人為造成的干擾物質減低到最少量並且有這個墊子，這樣演奏者可以將它放在腿上當他們躺在掃描儀里，用他們的背後表演時。", "en": "(Video) Charles Limb: This is a plasticMIDI piano keyboard that we use for the jazz experiments. And it's a 35-key keyboard designed to fit both inside the scanner, be magnetically safe, have minimal interferencethat would contribute to any artifact, and have this cushionso that it can rest on the players' legs while they're lying down in the scanner,playing on their back."}, {"zh-tw": "它是這樣工作的 ——它並不真正產生任何聲音。它會輸出一個 MIDI 的信號--或者叫音樂設備數字接口--信號通過這些電線中進入這個盒子然後進入電腦，然後發出一個高品質的鋼琴聲。", "en": "It works like this --this doesn't actually produce any sound. It sends out what's calleda MIDI signal -- or a Musical InstrumentDigital Interface -- through these wires into the boxand then the computer, which then triggerhigh-quality piano samples like this."}, {"zh-tw": "（音樂）（音樂）查爾斯·理姆：好，所以它是可用的。所以通過這個鋼琴鍵盤，我們現在有辦法獲取一段音樂的過程並來研究它。", "en": "(Music) (Music) (Music ends) OK, so it works. And so through this piano keyboard, we have the means to takea musical process and study it."}, {"zh-tw": "那現在你有了這個很酷的鋼琴鍵盤了，你要做點什麼呢？你不能光說——“我們弄到這麼各好鍵盤真是太棒了。”實際上，我們必須想出一個科學實驗。這個實驗依靠以下這些。當我們依循記憶運用一些熟悉的事物時，大腦會如何活動？當自發的產生或即興創作出一些東西，我們的大腦又發生了什麼在某種程度上那是運動神經和低階感官運動特徵符合的情形？所以，我這裡提供一個範例。", "en": "So what do you do now that you havethis cool piano keyboard? You can't just say,\"It's great we have a keyboard.\" We have to come upwith a scientific experiment. The experimentreally rests on the following: What happens in the brain during somethingthat's memorized and over-learned, and what happens in the brainduring something that is spontaneouslygenerated, or improvised, in a way that's matched motorically and in terms of lower-levelsensory motor features? I have here what we call the paradigms."}, {"zh-tw": "有一個音階範例，就是彈奏上下的音調，並記起來。然後是這段音階的即興演奏--4分音符，節拍器，右手--從科學觀點是很安全的，但是從音樂角度來說確非常無聊。最後還有一個，稱為爵士樂的範例。", "en": "There's a scale paradigm, which is playinga scale up and down, memorized, then there's improvising on a scale, quarter notes, metronome, right hand -- scientifically very safe, but musically really boring. Then there's the bottom one,which is called the jazz paradigm."}, {"zh-tw": "然後我們將專業的爵士樂手帶到美國國家健康研究中心，接著讓他們記住像左下方的音樂，就是你們剛剛聽我彈的這段，然後我們讓他們即興創作同一段相同的和弦。如果你點擊右下方的聲音圖標，這裡有一個掃描儀記錄的例子。", "en": "So we brought professionaljazz players to the NIH, and we had them memorizethis piece of music on the lower-left, which is what you heard me playing -- and we had them improviseto the same chord changes. And if you can hitthat lower-right sound icon, that's an exampleof what was recorded in the scanner."}, {"zh-tw": "（音樂）總而言之，這並不是最自然的環境，但是他們能夠演奏真實的音樂。雖然我已經把那段獨奏聽過200次了，我仍然喜歡它。", "en": "(Music) (Music ends) In the end, it's not the mostnatural environment, but they're able to play real music. And I've listened to that solo 200 times, and I still like it."}, {"zh-tw": "而音樂家們，他們最後也感覺很好。我們先測量這些音符的數量。", "en": "And the musicianswere comfortable in the end. We first measured the number of notes."}, {"zh-tw": "他們在即興表演時真的彈奏了更多的音符嗎？並不是這樣的。然後我們看了腦部的活動。", "en": "Were they playing more noteswhen they were improvising? That was not what was going on. And then we looked at the brain activity."}, {"zh-tw": "我試著把這部分壓縮，來告訴你們。這是對比圖，它顯示出當你在即興創作和你正在做記憶中的事情時的差值。", "en": "I will try to condense this for you. These are contrast maps that are showingsubtractions between what changes when you're improvisingvs. when you're doing something memorized."}, {"zh-tw": "紅色部分是前額葉皮質活動的區域，是大腦的前額葉。而藍色，是不活動的區域。我們管這個重點區域叫做內側前額葉皮質活動很頻繁。", "en": "In red is an area that's activein the prefrontal cortex, the frontal lobe of the brain, and in blue is this areathat was deactivated. So we had this focal areacalled the medial prefrontal cortex that went way up in activity."}, {"zh-tw": "這塊寬的區域稱為外側前額葉皮層活動較遲緩， 我們來做個總結。這些是腦部的多功能區域。就像我說的，這不是大腦裡爵士樂的區域。", "en": "We had this broad patch of areacalled the lateral prefrontal cortex that went way down in activity, I'll summarize that for you. These are multifunctionalareas of the brain, these are not the jazz areas of the brain."}, {"zh-tw": "他們負責主要的事情這些事情跟自我反省，內省及工作記憶相關。真實的意識存在前額葉.", "en": "They do a whole host of things that have to do with self-reflection, introspection, working memory etc. Really, consciousness is seatedin the frontal lobe."}, {"zh-tw": "但是我們認為有一個相關的區域自我控制的部分是關閉的，而這塊區域被認為是自動傳遞(導)的，或者是自我表現的區域開啟了。我們認為，至少初步認為這是一項研究，它可能是錯誤的。但它仍然是一項研究。我們認為，至少一個合理的假說是，要有創造性，你的前額葉不得不有這樣的分離。", "en": "But we have this combination of an area that's thought to be involvedin self-monitoring, turning off, and this area that's thoughtto be autobiographical, or self-expressive, turning on. We think, at least in this preliminary -- it's one study; it's probably wrong,but it's one study -- we think that at leasta reasonable hypothesis is that, to be creative, you should have this weird dissociationin your frontal lobe."}, {"zh-tw": "一塊區域工作，而一大塊區域關閉，從而使你不被約束，願意去犯錯誤，因此你不是一直處於關閉所有這些新的能夠製造東西的衝動狀態。現在，很多人知道音樂並不總是一個獨立的活動——有時它是一個溝通性的活動。", "en": "One area turns on,and a big area shuts off, so that you're not inhibited,you're willing to make mistakes, so that you're not constantlyshutting down all of these new generative impulses. Now a lot of people know that musicis not always a solo activity -- sometimes it's done communicatively."}, {"zh-tw": "所以下一個問題是：當音樂家們前後替換時，被稱為4小節交換，也就是他們通常在爵士樂實驗中做的？這是一段12小節的布魯斯音樂。我將它按四小節分組，所以你知道你是怎樣交換的。", "en": "The next question was: What happens when musiciansare trading back and forth, something called \"trading fours,\" which is something they donormally in a jazz experiment. So this is a 12-bar blues, and I've broken itdown into four-bar groups, so you would know how you would trade."}, {"zh-tw": "現在，我們將一位音樂家置入掃描儀--用同樣的方式--讓他們記憶這段旋律然後讓另外一名音樂家在外面的控制室前後互動相互彈奏。這是一位音樂家，麥克·波普，世界上最好的貝司手之一，也是一個了不起的鋼琴家。", "en": "We brought a musicianinto the scanner, same way, had them memorize this melody then had another musicianout in the control room trading back and forth interactively. So this is a musician, Mike Pope, one of the world's best bassistsand a fantastic piano player."}, {"zh-tw": "他現在正在彈這段我們剛剛看到的只是他彈的比我寫得好一點。", "en": "(Music) He's now playing the piecethat we just saw a little better than I wrote it. (Video) CL: Mike, come on in."}, {"zh-tw": "（視頻）查爾斯·理姆：護士：你口袋里沒東西了，對吧 麥克？麥克·波普：是的，我口袋裡什麼也沒有了。 （護士： 好。）", "en": "Mike Pope: May the force be with you. Nurse: Nothing in your pockets, Mike? MP: No. Nothing's in my pockets."}, {"zh-tw": "查爾斯·理姆：你必須用正確的態度接受它。它其實挺有趣的。", "en": "CL: You have to have the rightattitude to agree to do it. It's kind of fun, actually."}, {"zh-tw": "現在我們開始交互彈奏。他在裏面了。你可以看到他的腿在那裡。", "en": "(Music) Now we're playing back and forth. He's in there.You can see his legs up there."}, {"zh-tw": "而我在控制室裡，交互彈奏。（音樂）（視頻）麥克·波普： 這剛好可以好好的表現它的形式。", "en": "(Music) And then I'm in the control room here,playing back and forth. (Music) (Music ends) (Video) Mike Pope:This is a pretty good representation of what it's like."}, {"zh-tw": "而且它很好因為它不是很快。事實上，我們一遍一遍地重複它，讓你習慣你周圍的環境。", "en": "And it's good that it's not too quick. The fact that we do it over and over again lets you acclimate to your surroundings."}, {"zh-tw": "所以對我來說最難的是運動知覺的部份，藉由兩面鏡子看我的雙手，躺著除了手，別的都不能動。這很有挑戰性。", "en": "So the hardest thing for mewas the kinesthetic thing, looking at my hands through two mirrors, laying on my back, and not able to move at allexcept for my hand. That was challenging."}, {"zh-tw": "但是再一次，有一瞬間，非常確定的，有一瞬間，真的，真誠的音樂相互作用，是肯定的。查爾斯·理姆：在這一點上，我要耽誤一點時間。", "en": "But again -- there were moments, for sure -- there were moments of real, honest-to-Godmusical interplay, for sure. CL: At this point,I'll take a few moments."}, {"zh-tw": "你們現在能看到什麽--而我現在要犯一種科學的禁忌，就是向你們展示一些初步的數據。這是一個主體的數據。", "en": "So what you're seeing here -- and I'm doing a cardinal sin in science, which is to show you preliminary data. This is one subject's data."}, {"zh-tw": "這是，實際上，麥克波普的數據。所以我要讓你們看什麽呢？當他在和我配合4小節的彈奏時，是靠即興而非記憶他的語言區域亮了起來，也就是他的布洛卡區，也就是左邊的額下回。", "en": "This is, in fact, Mike Pope's data. So what am I showing you here? When he was trading fours with me,improvising vs. memorized, his language areas lit up,his Broca's area, in the inferior frontal gyrus on the left."}, {"zh-tw": "他實際上在右邊也有一塊相應的區域。這是一塊被認為是參與表達溝通的區域。", "en": "He had it also homologous on the right. This is an area thought to beinvolved in expressive communication."}, {"zh-tw": "這所有的關於音樂是一種語言的觀念，嗯，事實上也許歸根結底是有神經學基礎的，而當兩個音樂家在進行音樂對話的時候，我們可以看到它。而現在我們已經在八個主體上做了這個實驗，然後我們把所有數據匯聚在一起，但願我們將會得到一些有意義的結果。", "en": "This whole notionthat music is a language -- maybe there's a neurologicbasis to it after all, and we can see it when two musiciansare having a musical conversation. So we've done this on eight subjects now, and we're getting all the data together, hopefully we'll have somethingto say about it meaningfully."}, {"zh-tw": "現在當我想到即興和語言，那接下來是什麽呢？說唱，肯定的，說唱 --自由形式。我一直都對自由式說唱很著迷。", "en": "Now when I think about improvisationand the language, what's next? Rap, of course, rap -- freestyle. I've always been fascinated by freestyle."}, {"zh-tw": "讓我們繼續，播放這段視頻。（視頻）莫斯 戴夫：我是棕色皮膚，我站了五十年數♫當我在你左右，我搖滾♫♫各種形勢的協同，相對辨認♫♫來試著傷害我，化學分解它們♫♫不是數字十，說說我該怎麼樣♫♫像肯尼迪一樣的風格，像3點差十分一樣晚♫♫當我說當我做，女孩們隨聲調整♫查爾斯·理姆：有大量的比擬在自由式說唱和爵士樂之間。", "en": "And let's play this video.
