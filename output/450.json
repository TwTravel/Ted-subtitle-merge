What about if I puta thermal sponge in the middle, in the passageway between where the airhas to move between hot and cold?

These petals cost about a dollar each -- they're lightweight,injection-molded plastic, aluminized.", "zh-tw": "這一組有12片花瓣這些花瓣每一片大概 1 塊美金 -它很輕，是以塑膠注射成型後再鍍上一層鋁，"}, {"en": "The mechanism to controleach petal is below there, with a microprocessor on each one. There are thermocouples on the engine -- little sensors that detect the heatwhen the sunlight strikes them.", "zh-tw": "每一片花瓣是由其下方各自的微處理器所控制，在引擎上有一些熱電偶 -- 小小的感應器在陽光照射到它們時，用來偵測溫度。"}, {"en": "Each petal adjusts itself separatelyto keep the highest temperature on it. When the sun comes out in the morning,the petals will seek the sun, find it by searchingfor the highest temperature.", "zh-tw": "每一片花瓣會分別自行進行調整以獲得最高的溫度。早上太陽出來時，花瓣們就開始找尋太陽的位置，藉由尋找最高溫度的方位來找到太陽的位置。"}, {"en": "About a minute and a half or two minutesafter the rays are striking the hot cap the engine will be warm enough to start and then the enginewill generate electricity for about six and a half hours a day -- six and a half to seven hoursas the sun moves across the sky. A critical partthat we can take advantage of is that we have theseinexpensive microprocessors and each of these petals is autonomous, and each of these petals figures outwhere the sun is with no user setup.", "zh-tw": "大概一分半到兩分鐘，當光線照射到熱罩之後引擎會漸漸達到工作溫度而啟動，於是引擎在這一天中將會持續發電約六個半小時 --隨著太陽在空中移動，大約六個半小時到七個小時。我們所利用的一個重點是，我們有這些便宜的微處理器，每一片花瓣都是自行控制的，每一片花瓣不需要使用者設定就可以自行找到太陽。"}, {"en": "So you don't have to tellwhat latitude, longitude you're at, what your roof slope angle is,or what orientation. It doesn't really care.", "zh-tw": "所以你不需要知道你所在的經緯度，你不需要知道你的屋頂傾斜角度是多少，你不需要知道方位，這些都不重要。"}, {"en": "What it does is it searchesto find the hottest spot, it searches again a half an hour later,a day later, a month later. It basically figures outwhere on Earth you are by watching the direction the sun moves, so you don't have toactually enter anything about that.", "zh-tw": "它會自己去找到最熱的位置，它每半小時會重新找尋一次，一天之後也會重新找尋，一個月之後也會再次找尋，基本上它可以藉由太陽移動的方向來判斷你在地球上的那個位置，所以你不需要輸入任何資料。這個套件的作用方式是，當太陽出來以後，"}, {"en": "The way the unit works is, when the sun comes out,the engine will start and you get power out here. We have AC and DC, get 12 volts DC, so that could be usedfor certain applications.", "zh-tw": "引擎就會啟動，然後電力就會從這邊出來。我們有 AC 和 DC 兩種選擇，有12伏特的直流電，這可以用於特定的用品上。"}, {"en": "We have an inverter in there,so you get 117 volts AC. And you also get hot water.The hot water's optional.", "zh-tw": "這裡有個轉換器，所以你可以有117伏特的交流電，另外你也可以得到熱水。熱水是選配。"}, {"en": "You don't have to use it,it will cool itself. But you can use itto optionally heat hot water and that bringsthe efficiency up even higher because some of the heatthat you'd normally be rejecting, you can now use as useful energy,whether it's for a pool or hot water.", "zh-tw": "你不需要去使用熱水，它會自行冷卻。但你可以選擇去使用它來加熱其他的熱水，這樣會讓效率達到更高，因為通常這種熱都會被廢棄，你可以將它變成有用的能量，不論是用於溫暖水池或是加熱熱水。讓我展示一段它如何作動的短片。"}, {"en": "Let me show you a quick movieof what this looks like running. This is the first testwhere we took it outside and each of the petalswere individually seeking.", "zh-tw": "這是我們將它移到室外進行的第一次測試，每片花瓣自行進行搜尋。"}, {"en": "And what they do is step,very coarsely at first, and very finely afterward. Once they get a temperature readingon the thermocouple indicating they found the sun, they slow down and do a fine search.", "zh-tw": "它們一開始會很粗略的移動，之後變得相當細微的移動。一旦它們藉由熱電偶感應溫度，顯示它們找到太陽後，接著它們會慢下來，進行細微搜尋，"}, {"en": "Then the petals will move into position,and the engine will start. We've been working on thisfor the last two years.", "zh-tw": "於是所有的花瓣會移動到定位，然後引擎就開始啟動。我們已經研究這個兩年了。"}, {"en": "We're very excited about the progress,we have a long way to go though. This is how we envisionit would be in a residential installation: you'd probably havemore than one unit on your roof.", "zh-tw": "我們對進度都很滿意，雖然我們還有很常的路要走，接下來我再補充一些。這是我們預期一般住宅會裝置的位置，你可能會在屋頂裝上好幾個。"}, {"en": "It could be on your roof,your backyard, or somewhere else. You don't have to have enough unitsto power your entire house, you just save moneywith each incremental one you add.", "zh-tw": "它可以裝置在屋頂、後院或其他地方。你不需要有足夠的套件來供給整個房子的用電量，每裝置一具就可以讓你省下一些電費。"}, {"en": "So you're still usingthe grid potentially, in this type of application,to be your backup supply -- of course, you can't use these at night,and you can't use these on cloudy days. But by reducing your energy use,pretty much at the peak times -- usually when you haveyour air conditioning on, or other times like that -- this generates the peak powerat the peak usage time, so it's very complementary in that sense.", "zh-tw": "所以即使你有了這個發電機具，你仍然需要使用傳統的電網系統，這可以作為備用電源，但是你沒辦法在夜間使用，你也沒辦法在陰天使用。但是這可以減少你的用電量，尤其在尖峰時刻 --通常是你在吹著冷氣的時候，或其他類似的時候 --這可以在用電尖峰時提供你尖峰用電的電源，所以它可以用這種概念來作為補充性電源。"}, {"en": "This is how we would envisiona residential application. We also think there'svery big potential for energy farms, especially in remote landwhere there happens to be a lot of sun.", "zh-tw": "這是我們預期運用在一般住宅的方式。我們將它用於能源農場也有很大的潛力，尤其是用在有很充沛陽光的偏遠地區。把這兩種因素結合在一起真的很棒。"}, {"en": "It's a really good combinationof those two factors. It turns out there's a lot of powerful sunall around the world, obviously, but in special places where it happens to berelatively inexpensive to place these and also in many more placeswhere there is high wind power.", "zh-tw": "很明顯的，世界上有很多地方有強烈的陽光照射，但是在某些特別的地方放置這些太陽能發電機的費用相對便宜，當然，在某些地方則較有利於使用風力發電。"}, {"en": "So an example of that is,here's the map of the United States. Pretty much everywhere that'snot green or blue is a really ideal place, but even the green or blue areas are good, just not as good as the placesthat are red, orange and yellow.", "zh-tw": "舉例來說，這是美國的地圖，只要不是綠色或藍色的地方都是很理想的區域，即使是綠色或藍色的區域也很好，只是不像紅色、橘色和黃色那麼棒。"}, {"en": "But the hot spot right around Las Vegasand Death Valley is very good. And is only affects the payback period, it doesn't mean that youcouldn't use solar energy; you could use it anywhere on Earth.", "zh-tw": "但在拉斯維加斯和死亡谷附近的熱點則是非常非常棒的。這深深影響著回收需要的時間，這不是指你不能用太陽能，你可以在地球上任何地方使用太陽能。"}, {"en": "It just affects the payback period if you're comparingto grid-supplied electricity. But if you don't havegrid-supplied electricity, then the question of paybackis a different one entirely.", "zh-tw": "只是相對於電網使用，這會影響到你回收需要的時間，但是如果你沒有電網系統供電，那麼回收就變成另一個不同的問題了。那只是每花一塊錢可以獲得的瓦數是多少，"}, {"en": "It's just how many wattsdo you get per dollar, and how could you benefit from thatto change your life in some way. This is the map of the whole Earth, and you can seea huge swathe in the middle where a large part of the population is, there's tremendous chancesfor solar energy.", "zh-tw": "以及改用這種電力供應方式之後你可以在生活中可以獲得哪些好處。這是美國地圖，這是整個地球的地圖，你可以看見中間巨大的長條區域，那是人口最密集的區域，使用太陽能後將會有很驚人的改變。"}, {"en": "And of course, look at Africa. The potential to take advantageof solar energy there is unbelievable, and I'm really excited to talk moreabout finding ways we can help with that.", "zh-tw": "當然，例如非洲，在這兒利用太陽能的潛力是相當不可思議的，能夠找到更多這類型的方式去使用它讓我感到很興奮。所以，在最後，我想告訴大家，"}, {"en": "So, in conclusion, I would saymy journey has shown me that you can revisitold ideas in a new light, and sometimes ideasthat have been discarded in the past can be practical now if you applysome new technology or new twists. We believe we're getting very closeto something practical and affordable.", "zh-tw": "我的經歷告訴我，你可以用新的思維去重新檢視舊的想法，過去那些曾經被拋棄的點子，你可以利用新的科技或技巧去讓它實現。我們相信我們已經很接近讓它實用化並且低價化。"}, {"en": "Our short-term goal for thisis to be half the price of solar cells and our longer-term goalis to be less than a five-year payback. And at less than a five-year payback,this becomes very economic.", "zh-tw": "我們的短期目標是要讓它的售價低於太陽能電池的一半，而長期目標則是希望能讓回收期小於五年，只要回收期能小於五年，這就很有經濟價值。"}, {"en": "So you don't have to just havea feel-good attitude about energy to want to have one of these. It just makes economic sense.", "zh-tw": "你不會只為了要節能才去夠買這東西。"}, {"en": "Right now, solar paybacksare between 30 and 50 years. If you get it down below five years, then it's almost a no-brainerbecause the interest to own it -- someone else will finance it for youand you can just make money from day one.", "zh-tw": "購買因素將只是為了省錢。現在太陽能的回收期大概是三十到五十年。如果能夠降低到五年內，那麼它會變成很簡單的概念，因為想要去擁有它 --某人會因為它而付你錢，你可以用它來賺錢，基本上是從擁有它的第一天開始。"}, {"en": "So that's our real powerful goal that we're reallyshooting for in the company. Two other things that I learnedthat were very surprising to me -- one was how casual we are about energy.", "zh-tw": "而我們最重要的目標是，我們希望將它推入企業內。還有另外兩件令我震驚的事 --第一是，我們對於能源使用有多麼隨便。"}, {"en": "I was walking from the elevator over here, and even just lookingat the stage right now -- so there's probably20,500-watt lights right now. There's 10,000 watts of lightpouring on the stage, one horsepoweris 746 watts, at full power.", "zh-tw": "我剛剛從電梯那兒走過來時，甚至是看看現在講台這邊 --現在這裡大概有20盞500瓦的燈，大約十萬瓦的光線照射在講台上，一匹馬力是756瓦，以全功率計算。"}, {"en": "So there's basically 15 horses runningat full speed just to keep the stage lit. Not to mention the 200 horsesthat are probably running right now to keep the air-conditioning going.", "zh-tw": "所以基本上有15匹馬正在全力奔跑著才能讓講台亮著。更不用提可能有200匹正在奔跑著，以維持空調持續運轉。"}, {"en": "And it's just amazing, walk in the elevator,and there's lights on in the elevator. Of course, now I'm very sensitive at homewhen we leave the lights on by mistake.", "zh-tw": "更驚訝的是，走進電梯時，電梯裡有一盞燈正亮著。當然，我很在意家裡忘了隨手關燈這種事。但是，在生活周遭，我們總是很貪婪的使用著能源，"}, {"en": "But, everywhere around uswe have insatiable use for energy because it's so cheap. And it's cheap becausewe've been subsidized by energy that's been concentrated by the sun.", "zh-tw": "因為它太便宜了。它很便宜，因為我們受惠於一種由太陽光所聚集而成的能源。"}, {"en": "Basically, oil issolar-energy concentrate. It's been pounded for a billion yearswith a lot of energy to make it have all that energycontained in it.", "zh-tw": "基本上，原油是太陽能的濃縮物。那是經歷了上億年能量的累積才讓它有著目前所蘊藏能源。"}, {"en": "And we don't have a birthright to just use that upas fast as we are, I think. And it would be great if we couldmake our energy usage renewable, where as we're using the energy,we're creating it at the same pace, and I really hope we can get there.", "zh-tw": "我認為我們沒有與生俱來的權利那麼快速的去用光它。最好的辦法是，如果我們能夠找到方法讓能源能夠再生使用，在我們消耗能源的同時，以相同的速度製造出等量的能源，我很希望我們能夠做到這一點。"}, {"en": "Thank you very much,you've been a great audience.", "zh-tw": "謝謝大家，你們是好聽眾。"}], "title": "Bill Gross On New Energy", "url": "http://www.ted.com/talks/bill_gross_on_new_energy"}
