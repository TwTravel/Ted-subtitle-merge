The other founding membersincluded Ahmed Ahmed, who is an Egyptian-American,who actually had the idea to go to the Middle East and try it outbefore we went out as a tour. He went out solo and did it first."}, {"zh-tw": "還有阿朗．卡達，他是巴勒斯坦裔美國人，最後就是我，伊朗裔美國人。", "en": "Then there was Aron Kader,who was the Palestinian-American. And then there was me,the Iranian-American of the group."}, {"zh-tw": "身為一個伊朗裔美國人，我有別人沒有的問題。你知道，這二個國家最近處得不太好，", "en": "Now, being Iranian-Americanpresents its own set of problems, as you know. Those two countriesaren't getting along these days."}, {"zh-tw": "所以我內心有很多衝突，就像是有一半的我喜歡自己，另一半卻討厭自己；我自身一部分認為伊朗有核計畫，另一部分又認為美國不可信。", "en": "So it causes a lot of innerconflict, you know, like part of me likes me,part of me hates me. Part of me thinks I shouldhave a nuclear program, the other part thinksI can't be trusted with one."}, {"zh-tw": "我每天都處於這種天人交戰狀態。我出生在伊朗，現在是美國公民，也就是我有美國護照，我可以自由地旅行。", "en": "These are dilemmas I have every day. But I was born in Iran;I'm now an American citizen, which means I have the American passport, which means I can travel."}, {"zh-tw": "因為如果你只有伊朗的護照，歡迎你到訪的國家就不會太多--只有敘利亞、委內瑞拉和北韓。任何持有美國護照的人，都會告訴你，護照上會註明你的出生地。", "en": "Because if you only havethe Iranian passport, you're kind of limited to the countriesyou can go to with open arms, you know -- Syria, Venezuela, North Korea. So, anyone who's gotten their passportin America will tell you, when you get it, it still sayswhat country you were born in."}, {"zh-tw": "我還記得當我拿到我的美國護照時，我心想：「哇！我可以去旅行了！」但護照上面竟然寫著「伊朗出生」，我心想：「噢！拜託！」「我想去很多地方耶...」有趣的是，在我使用我的美國護照到西方國家遊玩的時候，從沒遇過麻煩，就算護照上寫著「伊朗出生」，也一樣沒問題。", "en": "So I remember gettingmy American passport. I was like, \"Woo-hoo!I'm going to travel.\" And I opened it up, it said, \"Bornin Iran.\" I'm like, \"Oh, come on, man!\" \"I'm trying to go places.\" But what's interesting is, I've never had trouble in any Westerncountries with my American passport, even though it says,\"Born in Iran\" -- no problems."}, {"zh-tw": "但我去阿拉伯國家旅行時，卻遇到一些問題，我想可能是阿拉伯國家和伊朗也處得不好吧！", "en": "Where I've had problemsis in some of the Arab countries.

They all went through."}, {"zh-tw": "「啊哈！美國人，很好！」然後他打開我的護照：「伊朗出生？等一下。」他開始問我一些問題，他說：「你父親叫什麼名字？」我說：「哦，他過世了，他叫胡思羅。」他繼續問：「那你祖父叫什麼名字？」我說：「他過世好久了，", "en": "Then the border patrol saw my Americanpassport: \"Ah-ha! American, great.\" Then he opened it up.\"Born in Iran? Wait.\" And he started asking me questions.

I'll be back,\"and he walked away.

It's way overdue. You owe us two billion dollars.\" But as you can see, when I talk,I speak with an American accent, which you would think,as an Iranian-American actor, I should be able to play any part,good, bad, what have you."}, {"zh-tw": "但在好萊塢，通常當選角導演發現你有中東血統後，他們就會說：「噢，原來你是伊朗人啊，太好了！你會不會說『我要以真主阿拉之名殺死你』？」「可以啊，但我可不可以演一個醫生？『哈囉，我是你的主治醫生』」他們回答：「好，然後你劫持醫院。」我猜你們一定不知道我在堅持什麼，別誤會，我並不介意扮演壞人，", "en": "But a lot of times in Hollywood, when casting directors find outyou're of Middle Eastern descent, they go, \"Oh, you're Iranian. Great! Can you say 'I will kill youin the name of Allah?'\" I go, \"I could say that,but what if I were to say, 'Hello. I'm your doctor'?\" They go, \"Great! And thenyou hijack the hospital.\" Like, I think you'remissing the point here. Don't get me wrong,I don't mind playing bad guys."}, {"zh-tw": "我還很想演壞人哩...我想要搶銀行，我想要在電影裡搶銀行，我想在電影裡扮演搶匪，用槍指著大家搶銀行，而不是在身上纏著炸彈，對吧？我認為導演一定會說：「莫茲，你的角色是一個身上纏著炸彈的銀行搶匪。」「為什麼我要這樣做？如果我想要的是錢，為什麼我要炸死自己？」對吧？「把錢全都交出來，不然我就炸死自己！」「噢，那就請便吧，", "en": "I want to play a bad guy.I want to rob a bank. I want to rob a bank in a film, but do it with a gun, not with a bombstrapped around me, right? Because I imagine the director:\"Maz, I think your character would rob the bankwith a bomb around him.\" \"Why would I do that? If I want the money,why would I kill myself?\" Right? \"Gimme all your money,or I'll blow myself up!\" \"Well, then blow yourself up."}, {"zh-tw": "要炸請到外面去炸。」其實世界上每個地方都有好人，這是我表演的重要主題，每個地方都有好人，只是一粒老鼠屎壞了一鍋粥。", "en": "Just do it outside, please.\" But the fact is, there's goodpeople everywhere.

I was watching the news. I'm like,\"Am I involved in this crap?\" \"I didn't get the memo.

My question is: Why would you take creditfor a failed car bombing? \"We just want to say: we tried.\" \"And furthermore ..."}, {"zh-tw": "有心最重要。」「最後你總會得到一些，又失去一些。」其實，當那個白人開著飛機飛進那個大樓時，我知道所有我在美國的中東朋友和回教徒朋友們，都在一邊看著電視，一邊祈禱：「拜託，不要是中東人，不要是海珊，不要是胡笙。」當新聞宣布那人的名字是傑克時，我大叫：「哇！不是我們！」但我還是一直盯著新聞，我怕他們會突然發現：「在他犯下這起案件之前，他改信了回教。」「該死！為什麼是傑克？為什麼？」事實上，我一直都很幸運，我有機會到全世界各地去表演，我也有中東表演過很多次，我剛剛才結束七個國家的個人巡迴演出。", "en": "it is the thought that counts.\" \"And in conclusion, win some, lose some.\" But what happened was, when the white guyflew his plane into the building, I know all my Middle Easternand Muslim friends in the States were watching TV, going, \"Please, don't be Middle Eastern.Don't be Hassan or Hussein.\" And the name came out: Jack.I'm like, \"Woooo! That's not one of us!\" But I kept watching the newsin case they came back, and were like, \"Before he did it,he converted to Islam.\" \"Damn it! Why Jack? Why?\" But the fact is, I've been lucky to get a chance to performall over the world, and I did a lot of showsin the Middle East. I just did a seven-country solo tour."}, {"zh-tw": "我去了阿曼、沙烏地阿拉伯，還有杜拜。", "en": "I was in Oman, and I was in Saudi Arabia. I was in Dubai."}, {"zh-tw": "整個巡迴演出都很棒，每個地方都有好人，你會在這些國家學到一些很棒的事，", "en": "And it's great, there's goodpeople everywhere.

For example, Dubai -- cool place."}, {"zh-tw": "他們很喜歡最大、最高、最長的東西，杜拜有一個商城，叫做杜拜商城，", "en": "They're obsessed with having the biggest,tallest, longest, as we all know. They have a mall there, the Dubai Mall."}, {"zh-tw": "那個商城很大，裡面竟然還有計程車在跑，我一邊逛街，一邊還聽到「叭，叭」我說：「計程車怎麼跑進來了？」他回答：「我要去撒拉商店，那裡離這裡還有三哩遠，", "en": "It is so big, they have taxis in the mall. I was walking. I heard, \"Beep! Beep!\"I'm like, \"What are you doing here?\" He goes, \"I'm going to the Zara store.It's three miles away."}, {"zh-tw": "讓路，讓路，讓路。」最瘋狂的是，全世界都在經濟不景氣，即使杜拜也一樣，但你從杜拜的物價卻看不出不景氣，像是在杜拜商城，他們的冰淇淋優格是以公克來計價，", "en": "Out of my way. Out of my way.Out of my way.\" And what's crazy -- there's a recessiongoing on, even in Dubai, but you wouldn't know by the prices. Like in the Dubai Mall,they sell frozen yogurt by the gram."}, {"zh-tw": "就像販賣毒品一樣。我走過那家店的時候，有一個傢伙說：「嘿，老兄，「要不要來點冰淇淋優格？來，來，來，", "en": "It's like a drug deal. I was walking by. The guy goes,\"Psst! Habibi, my friend.\" \"You want some frozen yogurt? Come here. Come here.

I said, \"What's in this?\" He's like, \"Good stuff, man.Colombian. Top of the line.\" The other thing you learnwhen you travel in these countries, in the Middle East, Latin American,South American countries, a lot of times when they build stuff,there's no rules and regulations. For example, I took my two-year-old sonto the playground at the Dubai Mall."}, {"zh-tw": "我那二歲的兒子已經玩遍了全美國各地的遊樂場了，而在美國，當你把二歲小孩放在滑溜梯上時，你會看到滑溜梯上有些止滑裝置，可以降低小孩滑下來的速度。", "en": "And I've taken him to playgroundsall over the United States. And when you put your two-year-oldon a slide in the United States, they put something on the slide to slow the kid downas he comes down the slide."}, {"zh-tw": "中東可不一樣，我把小孩放上滑溜梯後，他就飛出去了！我跑下來，我說：「我兒子哩？」「在三樓哦，先生，在三樓。」「搭計程車，去撒拉商店，左轉。」「嚐嚐這個優格，很棒哦，有一點貴。」在我的表演裡，我希望能打破一些刻板印象，", "en": "Not in the Middle East. I put my two-year-old on the slide,he went whoosh! He took off! I went down and, \"Where's my son?\"\"On the third floor, sir. Third floor.\" \"You take a taxi.You go to Zara. Make a left.\" \"Try the yogurt. It's very good.Little expensive.\" But one thing I try to dowith my stand-up is break stereotypes."}, {"zh-tw": "當然我對自己存有某些刻板印象感到羞愧。我在杜拜的時候，看到有許多印度人在杜拜工作，", "en": "And I've been guiltyof stereotyping as well. I was in Dubai. And there's a lotof Indians who work in Dubai."}, {"zh-tw": "但他們薪資並不高，所以我以為所有在杜拜的印度人都是勞工，", "en": "And they don't get paid that well. And I got it in my head that allthe Indians must be workers."}, {"zh-tw": "我忘記了在杜拜一定也有很成功的印度人。那時我在杜拜表演，那邊的人說：「我們會請司機去載你。」所以我走到大廳，看到一個印度人在那裡，我就想：「他一定是我的司機。」", "en": "I forgot there's obviouslysuccessful Indians in Dubai too. I was doing a show, and they said,\"We'll send a driver to pick you up.\" I went down to the lobby,and saw this Indian guy."}, {"zh-tw": "因為他穿著一身廉價的西裝，留著一撮小鬍子，還盯著我看，所以我走過去說：「抱歉，先生，你是我的司機嗎？」他回我說：「我不是，先生！這間飯店是我開的！」我說：「很抱歉，但你幹嘛盯著我看？」他回答：「我以為你才是我的司機哩！」我想說的是：我試著在我的表演中，打破各種刻板印象，以正面的方式呈現中東人，以正面的方式呈現回教徒，", "en": "I go, \"He must be my driver,\" since he's standing there in a cheapsuit, thin mustache, staring at me.
