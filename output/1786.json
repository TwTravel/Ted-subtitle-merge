This is a dolphin that is self-aware."}, {"zh-tw": "這隻海豚有自我意識。這隻小海豚名叫貝利 (Bayley)。", "en": "This dolphin has self-awareness. It's a young dolphin named Bayley."}, {"zh-tw": "過去三十年來，我對海豚有智能的天性很有興趣，我們怎麼發掘這種和我們如此不同的動物所具有的智能？我用的是非常簡單的研究工具：一面鏡子，而且我們從中搜集到許多這些動物的資訊和內心的反應。", "en": "I've been very interestedin understanding the nature of the intelligence of dolphinsfor the past 30 years. How do we exploreintelligence in this animal that's so different from us? And what I've used is a verysimple research tool, a mirror, and we've gainedgreat information, reflections of these animal minds."}, {"zh-tw": "海豚不是唯一一種不是人類，卻能夠從鏡中辨識自我的動物。過去我們總以為這是人類獨特的技能，但是我們從人類的近親大猩猩身上，也看到了這項能力。", "en": "Dolphins aren't the only animals,the only non-human animals, to show mirror self-recognition. We used to think thiswas a uniquely human ability, but we learned that the greatapes, our closest relatives, also show this ability."}, {"zh-tw": "然後，我們在海豚和大象的身上也看到了，我們在研究室中發現海豚和大象都做到了。最近我們發現的還有鵲。", "en": "Then we showed it in dolphins, and then later in elephants. We did this work in my labwith the dolphins and elephants, and it's been recentlyshown in the magpie."}, {"zh-tw": "這其中的奧妙在於一直以來，我們都遵循達爾文在形體演化的連續理論，但是我們卻很晚才察覺演化不僅僅發生在形體，其他的動物在認知、情感、知覺上，也都有演化的連續性。", "en": "Now, it's interesting,because we've embraced this Darwinian view of a continuityin physical evolution, this physical continuity. But we've been much morereticent, much slower at recognizing thiscontinuity in cognition, in emotion, in consciousnessin other animals."}, {"zh-tw": "其他的動物是有知覺的，牠們有感情、有意識。", "en": "Other animals are conscious. They're emotional. They're aware."}, {"zh-tw": "多年來，有許多不同物種的研究，提供了確切的證據，證明了其他動物具有思考和知覺的能力，那些動物的形體和我們很不一樣。我們不是獨一無二的。", "en": "There have been multitudesof studies with many species over the years that havegiven us exquisite evidence for thinking and consciousnessin other animals, other animals that are quitedifferent than we are in form. We are not alone."}, {"zh-tw": "我們並不是獨一無二擁有這些能力的動物。我希望，我最大的夢想之一就是隨著更加認知到地球上其他動物具有知覺，而我們和牠們的關係更緊密，人類就能用更公平的方式來尊敬與保護牠們。", "en": "We are not alone in these abilities. And I hope, and one of my biggest dreams, is that, with our growing awareness about the consciousness of others and our relationship with the restof the animal world, that we'll give themthe respect and protection that they deserve."}, {"zh-tw": "因此，今天我要把這個願望分享給每一位，希望你們也可以認同這個想法。現在，讓我們回到海豚，因為我覺得，牠們已經和我一同親密共事了超過三十年。", "en": "So that's a wish I'm throwingout here for everybody, and I hope I can reallyengage you in this idea. Now, I want to return to dolphins, because these are the animalsthat I feel like I've been working up closelyand personal with for over 30 years."}, {"zh-tw": "牠們都有真實的人格特質。牠們不是人，但是牠們對不同的事情也會展現不同的人格特質。", "en": "And these are real personalities. They are not persons,but they're personalities in every sense of the word."}, {"zh-tw": "你無法找到比海豚更獨特的生物了。牠們和我們的體型大不相同，", "en": "And you can't get morealien than the dolphin. They are very differentfrom us in body form."}, {"zh-tw": "牠們生來就很特別，在很特別的環境中生長。其實，我們早在九千五百萬年前就發生趨異演化，產生分歧。", "en": "They're radically different. They comefrom a radically different environment. In fact, we're separatedby 95 million years of divergent evolution."}, {"zh-tw": "看看這個身體。說句雙關語，牠們真的都不是地球人／陸地生物 ( non-terrestrials)。", "en": "Look at this body. And in every sense of making a pun here, these are true non-terrestrials."}, {"zh-tw": "我曾疑惑要怎麼和這些動物搭上線，1980 年代時，我發明了一種水底按鍵板，", "en": "I wondered how we mightinterface with these animals. In the 1980s, I developedan underwater keyboard."}, {"zh-tw": "這是一種客製化的觸控式按鍵板。我想讓海豚能夠選擇和控制。", "en": "This was a custom-madetouch-screen keyboard. What I wanted to do was givethe dolphins choice and control."}, {"zh-tw": "這些是有較大的腦和高度社交能力的動物。我想，嗯，如果我們給牠們一些選擇和控制，如果牠們可以按一下按鍵板上的符號——附帶一提，這是由惠普 (HP)所製成的光纖電纜面板，透過 Apple II 電腦來操作。現在看起來很過時，但那是我們當時僅有的技術。", "en": "These are big brains,highly social animals, and I thought, well, if we givethem choice and control, if they can hit a symbolon this keyboard -- and by the way, it was interfacedby fiber optic cables from Hewlett-Packardwith an Apple II computer. This seems prehistoric now, but this was wherewe were with technology."}, {"zh-tw": "海豚能按符號按鈕，牠們聽到電腦發出的哨音，就能夠找到對應的物體或活動。現在我們來看一小段影片，", "en": "So the dolphins could hit a key, a symbol, they heard a computer-generated whistle, and they got an object or activity. Now here's a little video."}, {"zh-tw": "這是德爾斐 (Delphi) 和潘 (Pan)，你會看到德爾斐按了一顆按鈕，牠聽到電腦發出的哨音，（哨音）然後牠拿了球，因此牠們真的可以要求牠們想要拿到的東西。驚人的是，牠們是靠自己學會用這塊按鍵板的，我們完全沒有插手，", "en": "This is Delphi and Pan,and you're going to see Delphi hitting a key, he hears a computer-generatedwhistle -- (Whistle) -- and gets a ball, so they canactually ask for things they want. What was remarkable is,they explored this keyboard on their own. There was nointervention on our part."}, {"zh-tw": "牠們自己摸索按鍵板，繞著它玩耍。牠們找出使用的方法，", "en": "They explored the keyboard.They played around with it. They figured out how it worked."}, {"zh-tw": "然後在短時間內就開始學著模仿牠們在按鍵板上聽到的聲音。牠們自己模仿。", "en": "And they started to quicklyimitate the sounds they were hearing on the keyboard. They imitated on their own."}, {"zh-tw": "這代表了牠們還開始學習符號、聲音和物體之間的關係。我們看到的是牠們有自主學習的能力，我開始想像，我們可以運用什麼樣的新技術？我們可以如何運用現有的科技設計介面、開啟動物心靈的新視窗？因此，我開始構想這件事，然後有一天，我接到了彼得的電話。", "en": "Beyond that, though, they started learning associationsbetween the symbols, the sounds and the objects. What we saw was self-organized learning, and now I'm imagining, what can we do with new technologies? How can we create interfaces,new windows into the minds of animals,with the technologies that exist today? So I was thinking about this,and then, one day, I got a call from Peter."}, {"zh-tw": "彼得．蓋布瑞爾 (Peter Gabriel)：我靠製造噪音為生。在好日子的時候，我做的就是音樂，我想談一點關於我曾經歷最美妙的音樂創作經驗。", "en": "Peter Gabriel: I make noises for a living. On a good day, it's music, and I want to talk a little bit about the most amazing music-makingexperience I ever had."}, {"zh-tw": "我是農村男孩，成長過程中被動物環繞，我會看著牠們的眼睛，疑惑著裡頭發生了什麼事？長大後，我開始讀一些有重大突破的驚人故事，像是佩妮．帕特森博士 ( Penny Patterson)和可可 (Koko)、休．薩瓦戈 - 魯姆博夫 (Sue Savage-Rumbaugh) 博士和坎茲 (Kanzi)、潘班尼莎 (Panbanisha)、艾琳．派波柏格 (Irene Pepperberg)、鸚鵡亞歷克斯 (Alex)，這些故事讓我非常興奮！最讓我驚奇的是牠們似乎非常擅於使用人類的語言，相較之下，我們對牠們的語言反而認識甚少。", "en": "I'm a farm boy. I grewup surrounded by animals, and I would look in these eyes and wonder what was going on there? So as an adult, whenI started to read about the amazing breakthroughswith Penny Patterson and Koko, with Sue Savage-Rumbaughand Kanzi, Panbanisha, Irene Pepperberg, Alex the parrot, I got all excited. What was amazing to me also was they seemed a lot more adept at getting a handle on our language than we were on gettinga handle on theirs."}, {"zh-tw": "我和世界上許多音樂家合作，通常我們沒有任何的共通語言，但是當我們坐在自己的樂器後，瞬間我們就能連結彼此、表達情感。因此，我開始到處打電話詢問，終於我找到了休博士，她邀請我過去。", "en": "I work with a lot of musiciansfrom around the world, and often we don't haveany common language at all, but we sit down behind our instruments, and suddenly there's a wayfor us to connect and emote. So I started cold-calling,and eventually got through to Sue Savage-Rumbaugh, and she invited me down."}, {"zh-tw": "我到那裡時，矮黑猩猩已經會敲打樂器和音樂玩具，但是還沒用過鋼琴鍵盤。一開始，牠們就像小嬰兒一樣，用拳頭胡亂敲打。然後我透過休博士問潘班尼莎能不能試著只用一根手指頭？", "en": "I went down, and the bonobos had had access to percussion instruments, musical toys, but neverbefore to a keyboard. At first they did what infants do, just bashed it with their fists, and then I asked, through Sue, if Panbanisha could trywith one finger only."}, {"zh-tw": "休博士：你可以彈一首編排過的曲子嗎？我想聽一首曲子，彈一首不那麼吵的曲子。", "en": "Sue Savage-Rumbaugh: Canyou play a grooming song? I want to hear a grooming song. Play a real quiet grooming song."}, {"zh-tw": "彼得：因此主題是編排過的曲子。（音樂）我只是站在後頭，適時介入，嗯，這是最初的作品，", "en": "PG: So groom was the subject of the piece. (Music) So I'm just behind, jamming, yeah, this is what we started with."}, {"zh-tw": "休博士鼓勵牠多彈一點。（音樂）牠發現了喜歡的音符，牠找到了音階。", "en": "Sue's encouraging herto continue a little more. (Music) She discovers a note she likes, finds the octave."}, {"zh-tw": "牠以前從來沒有坐在鍵盤前過。這個三連音不錯。", "en": "She'd never sat at a keyboard before. Nice triplets."}, {"zh-tw": "休博士：你做得很好，非常棒！彼得：牠彈得很棒！", "en": "SSR: You did good. That was very good. PG: She hit good."}, {"zh-tw": "因此那天晚上，我們開始想像，也許人類最棒的發明是網路，我們是否能夠找到新的介面，一種影音介面，讓這些和我們共同居住在地球上的非凡物種能夠使用的？休博士對這件事很興奮，她撥電話給朋友史提夫．伍德拉夫 (Steve Woodruff)，然後，我們就開始找尋在這領域工作，並且從事相關的激勵人心工作的朋友。後來，我們找到了黛安娜，認識了尼爾。尼爾．格申斐德 (Neil Gershenfeld)：謝謝彼得。彼得：謝謝！", "en": "So that night, we began to dream, and we thought, perhapsthe most amazing tool that man's created is the Internet, and what would happen if we could somehow find new interfaces, visual-audio interfaces that would allow these remarkable sentient beings that we share the planet with access? And Sue Savage-Rumbaughgot excited about that, called her friend Steve Woodruff, and we began hustling all sorts of people whose work related or was inspiring, which led us to Diana, and led us to Neil. Neil Gershenfeld: Thanks, Peter.PG: Thank you."}, {"zh-tw": "尼爾：後來，彼得和我聯繫。這個影片完全吸引了我的目光。", "en": "NG: So Peter approached me. I lost it when I saw that clip."}, {"zh-tw": "他帶我進入新的視野，做這些事不是為了人類，而是為了動物。然後我開始研究起網路的歷史。", "en": "He approached me with a visionof doing these things not for people, for animals. And then I was struckin the history of the Internet."}, {"zh-tw": "這是網路剛誕生時的模樣，你可以說網路就是白種的中年男子。幾乎都是白種的中年男子。文頓．瑟夫 (Vint Cerf)：（大笑）尼爾：說中一個了。", "en": "This is what the Internetlooked like when it was born and you can call that the Internet of middle-aged white men, mostly middle-aged white men. Vint Cerf: (Laughs) NG: Speaking as one."}, {"zh-tw": "然後，在我第一次來 TED 的時候，我認識了彼得，我給他看了這個。這是一塊美金的網頁伺服器，這在那時候是很前衛的。", "en": "Then, when I first came to TED, which was where I metPeter, I showed this. This is a $1 web server, and at the time that was radical."}, {"zh-tw": "以一塊錢做一個網頁伺服器的潛力無窮，這後來演變成眾所皆知的物聯網，現在大量運用在健康照護與節約能源兩大產業中。我們很自得其樂。", "en": "And the possibility of makinga web server for a dollar grew into what became knownas the Internet of Things, which is literally an industrynow with tremendous implications for health care, energy efficiency. And we were happy with ourselves."}, {"zh-tw": "當彼得給我看那個東西時，我意識到，我們一定遺漏了什麼，我們遺漏了地球的另一部分。因此，我們開始進行物種間的網絡計畫。", "en": "And then when Peter showed me that, I realized we had missed something, which is the rest of the planet. So we started up thisinterspecies Internet project."}, {"zh-tw": "後來，我們開始和 TED 討論，要怎麼把海豚、大猩猩和大象帶來 TED，我們發現不可能，所以，我們要把你們帶到牠們面前。", "en": "Now we started talking with TED about how you bring dolphinsand great apes and elephants to TED, and we realizedthat wouldn't work. So we're going to bring you to them."}, {"zh-tw": "如果我們打開這台電腦的影音，就能和有認知能力的動物進行視訊會議，現在就讓牠們一一簡短地自我介紹。這個能投影到上面嗎？太好了。", "en": "So if we could switchto the audio from this computer, we've been video conferencingwith cognitive animals, and we're going to have each of them just briefly introduce them. And so if we could alsohave this up, great."}, {"zh-tw": "首先，我們來到韋科 (Waco) 的卡梅倫動物園 (Cameron Park Zoo)拜訪猩猩。白天牠們會在戶外，現在那邊是晚上。", "en": "So the first site we're going to meet is Cameron Park Zooin Waco, with orangutans. In the daytime they live outside.It's nighttime there now."}, {"zh-tw": "可以開始了嗎？泰芮．柯克斯 (Terri Cox)：嗨，我是泰芮．柯克斯，我在德州韋科的卡梅倫動物園，在我身邊的是名叫可拉．潔安 (KeraJaan) 和梅 (Mei)的婆羅洲猩猩 (Bornean orangutan) 。白天，牠們可以待在戶外一個很大、很美麗的棲息地裡；晚上，牠們回到這裡，待在牠們的夜間宿舍，牠們可以在受到溫溼度控制，又安全的環境睡覺。", "en": "So can you please go ahead? Terri Cox: Hi, I'm Terri Cox with the Cameron Park Zoo in Waco, Texas, and with me I have KeraJaan and Mei, two of our Bornean orangutans.
