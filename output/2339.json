Actions, choices and behaviors will have led to an increasein greenhouse gas emissions."}, {"zh-tw": "我認為這個想法很震撼但也可能令人感到罪惡只要一想起做過的決定想去旅行的地方多常去、如何去還有在居家和工作環境所使用的能源或者僅僅是習慣的生活模式", "en": "And I think that that'squite a powerful thought. But it does have the potentialto make us feel guilty when we think about decisionswe might have made around where to travel to, how often and how, about the energy that we choose to use in our homes or in our workplaces, or quite simply the lifestylesthat we lead and enjoy."}, {"zh-tw": "然而我們可以翻轉這個想法既然我們已經對氣候造成如此劇烈而負面的影響我們也有機會影氣候變遷幅度也是我們得適應的氣候變遷幅度因此, 我們可以抉擇", "en": "But we can also turnthat thought on its head, and think that if we've hadsuch a profound but a negative impacton our climate already, then we have an opportunity to influencethe amount of future climate change that we will need to adapt to. So we have a choice."}, {"zh-tw": "一者, 開始正視氣候變遷大幅降低溫室氣體排放未來我們只需因應較緩和的氣候變遷反過來說, 若我們繼續無視氣候變遷", "en": "We can either choose to startto take climate change seriously, and significantly cut and mitigateour greenhouse gas emissions, and then we will have to adapt to lessof the climate change impacts in future. Alternatively, we can continue to reallyignore the climate change problem."}, {"zh-tw": "這一來, 我們選擇面對的將會是以後更強烈的氣候衝擊不只這樣", "en": "But if we do that, we are also choosing to adapt to very much more powerfulclimate impacts in future. And not only that."}, {"zh-tw": "由於我國人均排放量高我們也代表其他人做決定而我們的選項裡並沒有不遭受氣候變遷的未來", "en": "As people who live in countrieswith high per capita emissions, we're making that choiceon behalf of others as well. But the choice that we don't have is a no climate change future."}, {"zh-tw": "過去20年來我們的政府協商人及政策決定者不斷會面商討氣候變化問題努力避免地球氣溫比工業革命以前上升2℃不同指標都顯示超過這個溫度將對人類和環境帶來危險後果", "en": "Over the last two decades, our government negotiatorsand policymakers have been coming together to discuss climate change, and they've been focused onavoiding a two-degree centigrade warming above pre-industrial levels. That's the temperature that's associatedwith dangerous impacts across a range of different indicators, to humans and to the environment."}, {"zh-tw": "這2℃代表危險的氣候改變然而變遷的危險程度可能很主觀", "en": "So two degrees centigradeconstitutes dangerous climate change. But dangerous climate changecan be subjective."}, {"zh-tw": "例如有些地方會發生劇烈天災如果那裡公共建設完善人民都有保險天災可能只影響正常生活使人心情低落, 損失財物", "en": "So if we think aboutan extreme weather event that might happenin some part of the world, and if that happens in a part of the worldwhere there is good infrastructure, where there are peoplethat are well-insured and so on, then that impact can be disruptive. It can cause upset, it could cause cost."}, {"zh-tw": "或者一些人員傷亡但如果同樣天災發生在其他地方那裡基礎建設落後人們沒有保險又缺乏好的支援網絡那麼相同的氣候變遷就可能造成毀滅", "en": "It could even cause some deaths. But if that exact same weather eventhappens in a part of the world where there is poor infrastructure, or where people are not well-insured, or they're not havinggood support networks, then that same climate change impactcould be devastating."}, {"zh-tw": "成千上萬人流離失所罹難者不計其數這張圖, 左邊是石油燃料和工業的二氧化碳排放量時間軸則從工業革命前延伸到今日", "en": "It could cause a significant loss of home, but it could also causesignificant amounts of death. So this is a graph of the CO2 emissionsat the left-hand side from fossil fuel and industry, and time from beforethe Industrial Revolution out towards the present day."}, {"zh-tw": "最令人一眼震驚的是排放量呈指數成長如果縮短時間至1950年以來1988年, 各國成立政府間氣候變化專門委員會1992年召開了里約地球高峰會數年後, 2009年各國簽署哥本哈根協議同意根據科學方法和平等原則避免氣溫升幅超過2℃", "en": "And what's immediately striking about this is that emissionshave been growing exponentially. If we focus in on a shorterperiod of time from 1950, we have established in 1988 the Intergovernmental Panelon Climate Change, the Rio Earth Summit in 1992, then rolling on a few years,in 2009 we had the Copenhagen Accord, where it established avoidinga two-degree temperature rise in keeping with the scienceand on the basis of equity."}, {"zh-tw": "接著, 2012年召開了Rio+20世界永續發展高峰會然而這些會議一路下來還有許多其他會議排放量仍持續攀升", "en": "And then in 2012, we had the Rio+20 event. And all the way through,during all of these meetings and many others as well, emissions have continued to rise."}, {"zh-tw": "我們如果看近年的排放量走向加上對全球經濟發展方向的了解便發現, 我們更可能走上全球暖化4℃的道路而非2℃現在, 讓我們暫且想像全球平均升溫4℃的情況", "en": "And if we focus on our historicalemission trend in recent years, and we put that togetherwith our understanding of the direction of travelin our global economy, then we are much more on track for a four-degree centigradeglobal warming than we are for the two-degree centigrade. Now, let's just pause for a moment and think about this four-degreeglobal average temperature."}, {"zh-tw": "我們的地球大部分是海洋由於海洋的熱慣性比陸地高因此陸地的平均溫度實際上比較海洋高", "en": "Most of our planetis actually made up of the sea. Now, because the sea has a greaterthermal inertia than the land, the average temperatures over landare actually going to be higher than they are over the sea."}, {"zh-tw": "再者, 人類從未經歷過全球平均溫度我們有熱天、冷天雨天，尤其像我住曼徹斯特", "en": "The second thing is that weas human beings don't experience global average temperatures. We experience hot days, cold days, rainy days, especially if you livein Manchester like me."}, {"zh-tw": "現在想像你在世界上某大都會市中心如孟買, 北京, 紐約或倫敦", "en": "So now put yourself in a city center. Imagine somewhere in the world: Mumbai, Beijing, New York, London."}, {"zh-tw": "今天是你這輩子最熱的一天太陽光毒辣直射身旁全是水泥建築和玻璃帷幕", "en": "It's the hottest daythat you've ever experienced. There's sun beating down, there's concrete and glass all around you."}, {"zh-tw": "想像同樣這天溫度升高6, 8, 10或12度熱浪襲擊這是未來全球平均溫升4℃後我們所要面對的情形", "en": "Now imagine that same day -- but it's six, eight,maybe 10 to 12 degrees warmer on that day during that heat wave. That's the kind of thingwe're going to experience under a four-degree globalaverage temperature scenario."}, {"zh-tw": "這個問題伴隨著極端狀況不只有極端溫度還有超級暴風雨和其他氣候衝擊我們的公共建設並非為因應這些情形而建因此我們的公路、鐵路網設計上只能承受世界上不同地方的特殊天災衝擊以長久使用", "en": "And the problem with these extremes, and not just the temperature extremes, but also the extremes in terms of stormsand other climate impacts, is our infrastructure is just not set upto deal with these sorts of events. So our roads and our rail networks have been designed to last for a long time and withstand onlycertain amounts of impacts in different parts of the world."}, {"zh-tw": "因此這將是嚴峻考驗發電廠本來就用水降溫至特定溫度以保持效能並重新發電", "en": "And this is going to beextremely challenged. Our power stationsare expected to be cooled by water to a certain temperatureto remain effective and resilient."}, {"zh-tw": "建築物也設計在特定溫度範圍才能運作良好溫升4℃情況下這些設施都將備受挑戰", "en": "And our buildingsare designed to be comfortable within a particular temperature range. And this is all going to besignificantly challenged under a four-degree-type scenario."}, {"zh-tw": "公共建設不是設計來處理這些狀況讓我們再回到溫升4℃就算沒有直接影響也有間接衝擊", "en": "Our infrastructure has not beendesigned to cope with this. So if we go back, also thinkingabout four degrees, it's not just the direct impacts, but also some indirect impacts."}, {"zh-tw": "以糧食安全為例在某些地區受溫度上升4℃影響玉米和小麥產量可能銳減40％或減少30％", "en": "So if we take food security, for example. Maize and wheat yields in some parts of the world are expected to be up to 40 percent lower under a four-degree scenario, rice up to 30 percent lower."}, {"zh-tw": "這必將拖垮全球糧食安全因此溫升4℃帶來的整體衝擊將無法與全人類的生存秩序共存", "en": "This will be absolutely devastatingfor global food security. So all in all, the kindsof impacts anticipated under this four-degree centigrade scenario are going to be incompatiblewith global organized living."}, {"zh-tw": "再回到圖上4℃和2℃的路徑只關注2℃路徑還有道理嗎?我許多同事和科學家會說避免溫升2℃為時不晚", "en": "So back to our trajectories and our graphsof four degrees and two degrees. Is it reasonable stillto focus on the two-degree path? There are quite a lot of my colleaguesand other scientists who would say that it's now too lateto avoid a two-degree warming."}, {"zh-tw": "但我想引用我對能源體系、糧食體系航空與貨運的研究我認為仍有一點機會逆轉危險的2℃氣候變遷但我們非得從統計數字才知道該怎麼做", "en": "But I would just liketo draw on my own research on energy systems, on food systems, aviation and also shipping, just to say that I think there is stilla small fighting chance of avoiding this two-degreedangerous climate change. But we really needto get to grips with the numbers to work out how to do it."}, {"zh-tw": "如果你留意這圖和曲線黃圈位置凸顯出紅色4℃路徑與綠色2℃路徑快速分道揚鑣這因為累積排放量或碳預算的關係", "en": "So if you focus in on this trajectoryand these graphs, the yellow circle therehighlights that the departure from the red four-degree pathway to the two-degreegreen pathway is immediate. And that's becauseof cumulative emissions, or the carbon budget."}, {"zh-tw": "換句話說, 由於目前現場正使用燈光和投影器材二氧化碳持續進入大氣造成長時間持續用電有些氣體會在大氣中存留一世紀, 或者更久", "en": "So in other words, becauseof the lights and the projectors that are on in this room right now, the CO2 that is going into our atmosphere as a result of thatelectricity consumption lasts a very long time. Some of it will be in our atmospherefor a century, maybe much longer."}, {"zh-tw": "因此不斷增加溫室氣體也逐漸累積於是從中我們了解這兩條路徑", "en": "It will accumulate, and greenhouse gasestend to be cumulative. And that tells us somethingabout these trajectories."}, {"zh-tw": "首先, 曲線下的區域才是重點而非在哪一天達成目標因為問題不在於我們是否發展出驚人的先進科技好在2049年底解決能源問題及時化解危機", "en": "First of all, it tells us that it'sthe area under these curves that matter, not where we reachat a particular date in future. And that's important,because it doesn't matter if we come up with some amazingwhiz-bang technology to sort out our energy problemon the last day of 2049, just in the nick of timeto sort things out."}, {"zh-tw": "因為在此同時排放量仍不斷增加如果我們走紅色4℃路徑走得越久就必須在之後幾年進行補救以維持等量碳預算並保持在曲線下方如此一來, 紅曲線就變得更陡峭", "en": "Because in the meantime,emissions will have accumulated. So if we continue on this red,four-degree centigrade scenario pathway, the longer we continue on it, that will need to bemade up for in later years to keep the same carbon budget,to keep the same area under the curve, which means that that trajectory,the red one there, becomes steeper."}, {"zh-tw": "也就是, 如果短中期內無法降低排放之後每年都得大幅減量同時, 我們也必須讓能源系統去碳化", "en": "So in other words, if we don't reduceemissions in the short to medium term, then we'll have to make more significantyear-on-year emission reductions. We also know that we haveto decarbonize our energy system."}, {"zh-tw": "然而如果短中期內無法減排我們就得減量得更快這是個重大挑戰", "en": "But if we don't start to cutemissions in the short to medium term, then we will have to do that even sooner. So this poses really bigchallenges for us."}, {"zh-tw": "另外, 這也顯示了能源政策如果你身在人均排放量高的地方代表必須降低能源需求", "en": "The other thing it does is tells ussomething about energy policy. If you live in a part of the world whereper capita emissions are already high, it points us towardsreducing energy demand."}, {"zh-tw": "這是因為即便全球同心協力要讓短期內新建的大型能源設施供應去碳化的能源是不可能限期內實現的所以問題不在於該選擇核能或捕獲、封存碳排或提高生物燃料產品的水平或增加風力和潮汐發電產能", "en": "And that's becausewith all the will in the world, the large-scale engineering infrastructure that we need to roll out rapidly to decarbonize the supply sideof our energy system is just simply not goingto happen in time. So it doesn't matterwhether we choose nuclear power or carbon capture and storage, upscale our biofuel production, or go for a much bigger roll-outof wind turbines and wave turbines."}, {"zh-tw": "達成這些都得花時間由於重點在於曲線下面積我們需著重能源效率以及能源保護也就是減少能源使用", "en": "All of that will take time. So because it's the areaunder the curve that matters, we need to focus on energy efficiency, but also on energy conservation --in other words, using less energy."}, {"zh-tw": "如果做到了, 這代表我們可以持續供應能源負擔也將減輕只要我們確實達成降低能源消耗因為我們已不需那麼多能源建設另一需要努力解決的問題是人類安居樂業和平等問題", "en": "And if we do that, that also means that as we continue to roll outthe supply-side technology, we will have less of a job to doif we've actually managed to reduce our energy consumption, because we will then needless infrastructure on the supply side. Another issue that we reallyneed to grapple with is the issue of well-being and equity."}, {"zh-tw": "在很多地方生活水平極需提升但由於目前仍靠石油為能源因此只要經濟成長排放量也將增加", "en": "There are many parts of the world wherethe standard of living needs to rise. Bbut with energy systemscurrently reliant on fossil fuel, as those economies growso will emissions."}, {"zh-tw": "現在, 如果全世界遵守碳預算限制代表如果有地方將增加碳排放那麼其他地方就得減少這對富國是一大挑戰", "en": "And now, if we're all constrainedby the same amount of carbon budget, that means that if some parts ofthe world's emissions are needing to rise, then other parts of the world'semissions need to reduce. So that poses very significant challengesfor wealthy nations."}, {"zh-tw": "因為根據我們的研究人均排放量非常高的國家如北美, 歐洲, 澳洲現在開始每年減排10%那麼就很有機會避免2℃問題以具體脈絡來說", "en": "Because according to our research, if you're in a country where per capitaemissions are really high -- so North America, Europe, Australia -- emissions reductions of the orderof 10 percent per year, and starting immediately,will be required for a good chance of avoiding the two-degree target. Let me just put that into context."}, {"zh-tw": "經濟學家斯特恩曾說每年減排高於1%會造成經濟衰退和動盪這嚴重挑戰了經濟成長因為如果我們仍使用高碳排設施意味著經濟若成長碳排放也跟著成長", "en": "The economist Nicholas Stern said that emission reductionsof more than one percent per year had only ever been associatedwith economic recession or upheaval. So this poses huge challengesfor the issue of economic growth, because if we have ourhigh carbon infrastructure in place, it means that if our economies grow, then so do our emissions."}, {"zh-tw": "我想引用我和安德森2011年提出的研究報告為了避免2℃溫升導致危險的氣候變化至少短期內經濟成長必須互換富國要實行撙節計畫這很難說服人因為這建議要求改變做法", "en": "So I'd just like to takea quote from a paper by myself and Kevin Anderson back in 2011 where we said that to avoid the two-degreeframing of dangerous climate change, economic growth needs to be exchangedat least temporarily for a period of planned austerityin wealthy nations. This is a really difficultmessage to take, because what it suggests is thatwe really need to do things differently."}, {"zh-tw": "不只增加變革而是改變方法完全扭轉體系有時, 這代表少做一點", "en": "This is not about just incremental change. This is about doing things differently,about whole system change, and sometimesit's about doing less things."}, {"zh-tw": "這適用於所有人不論你我的影響層面為何可以寫信給選區議員跟老闆聊聊或當老闆實地做跟親友談談或單純改變生活模式", "en": "And this applies to all of us, whatever sphere of influence we have. So it could be from writingto our local politician to talking to our boss at workor being the boss at work, or talking with our friends and family,or, quite simply, changing our lifestyles."}, {"zh-tw": "因為, 我們真的需要大幅改變目前, 我們選了4℃道路", "en": "Because we really needto make significant change. At the moment, we're choosinga four-degree scenario."}, {"zh-tw": "如果想避免2℃處境現在就要行動謝謝大家", "en": "If we really want to avoidthe two-degree scenario, there really is no timelike the present to act. Thank you."}, {"zh-tw": "(吉薩尼)艾莉絲, 你演講提到除非富國每年減排10%現在今年開始不是2020或2025年否則我們將直入溫升4℃我好奇你對2070年減排70%的看法", "en": "Bruno Giussani: Alice,basically what you're saying, the talk is, unless wealthy nationsstart cutting 10 percent per year the emissions now, this year,not in 2020 or '25, we are going to go straightto the four-plus-degree scenario. I am wondering what's your takeon the cut by 70 percent for 2070."}, {"zh-tw": "(鲍爾‧拉金) 是的連避免2℃都差得遠呢我們常聽到一些模型研究, 建議該怎麼做它們大多高估世界各國可投入減排的時間", "en": "Alice Bows-Larkin: Yeah, it's justnowhere near enough to avoid two degrees. One of the things that often -- when there are these modeling studiesthat look at what we need to do, is they tend to hugely overestimatehow quickly other countries in the world can start to reduce emissions."}, {"zh-tw": "他們的假定過於美化這種研究做越多由於碳排的累積短期內的成果就非常重要", "en": "So they make kind ofheroic assumptions about that. The more we do that,because it's the cumulative emissions, the short-term stuff that really matters."}, {"zh-tw": "差異會很大假如大國, 像中國持續再發展僅僅數年那麼我們去碳的時間點又將大不同", "en": "So it does make a huge difference. If a big country like China, for example, continues to groweven for just a few extra years, that will make a big differenceto when we need to decarbonize."}, {"zh-tw": "因此很難說會在何時全靠短期內我們做了什麼但目前我們只知概略也尚未著手使能源需求降低真丟臉", "en": "So I don't think we can even saywhen it will be, because it all dependson what we have to do in the short term. But I think we've just got huge scope,and we don't pull those levers that allow us to reducethe energy demand, which is a shame."}, {"zh-tw": "(吉薩尼) 謝謝你來TED分享(鲍爾‧拉金) 謝謝", "en": "BG: Alice, thank you for comingto TED and sharing this data. ABL: Thank you."}], "title": "Alice Bows Larkin We Re Too Late To Prevent Climate Change Here S How We Adapt"}
