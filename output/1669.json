And why does good intimacynot guarantee good sex, contrary to popular belief? Or, the next question would be, can we want what we already have? That's the million-dollar question, right? And why is the forbidden so erotic? What is it about transgressionthat makes desire so potent? And why does sex make babies, and babies spell eroticdisaster in couples? It's kind of the fatalerotic blow, isn't it? And when you love, how does it feel? And when you desire, how is it different? These are some of the questions that are at the center of my explorationon the nature of erotic desire and its concomitantdilemmas in modern love. So I travel the globe, and what I'm noticing is that everywherewhere romanticism has entered, there seems to be a crisis of desire."}, {"zh-tw": "擁有所缺之物會帶來欲望的危機欲望是我們對個體的展現展現我們的自由選擇、我們的偏好、我們的身份欲望已成為一個核心概念存在於當代戀愛中，存在於個人主義社會中諸位可知這是人類歷史上第一次人們想要長期地體驗性生活並非因為我們想要14個孩子或是我們需要生育更多以免一些孩子早夭也不是因為這是女性獨有的婚姻義務", "en": "A crisis of desire,as in owning the wanting -- desire as an expressionof our individuality, of our free choice,of our preferences, of our identity -- desire that has become a central concept as part of modern loveand individualistic societies.

So what sustains desire,and why is it so difficult? And at the heart of sustainingdesire in a committed relationship, I think, is the reconciliationof two fundamental human needs."}, {"zh-tw": "一邊是我們對安全和可預知性的需求渴望安定、可靠、可信、永恆這些都是人生中停船落地的體驗", "en": "On the one hand, our needfor security, for predictability, for safety, for dependability, for reliability, for permanence.

What is the relationshipbetween love and desire? How do they relate,and how do they conflict? Because therein liesthe mystery of eroticism.

Not attracted sexually,per Se, but most drawn. And across culture, across religion,and across gender -- except for one -- there are a few answersthat just keep coming back."}, {"zh-tw": "第一組共同的回答是：“我認為伴侶最有魅力的時候,就是她不在身邊，我們相隔兩地，小別後的重逢時。”基本上，這些都是我能重新想像到與伴侶在一起的情形想像力之所以能回歸原因在於伴侶不在身邊而產生的渴望這份渴望正是欲望的主要成分", "en": "So the first group is: I am most drawn to my partnerwhen she is away, when we are apart, when we reunite. Basically, when I get back in touch with my ability to imagine myselfwith my partner, when my imagination comesback in the picture, and when I can root itin absence and in longing, which is a major component of desire."}, {"zh-tw": "第二組共同的回答則更為有趣：“我認為伴侶最有魅力的時候，“就是看到他在工作室（創作），她在舞臺上（表演）；“當他在自己的領域如魚得水時；當她做著全心熱愛的事情時；當我看到他在派對上魅力四射、受到他人歡迎時；“當我看到她主持庭審時。”", "en": "But then the second groupis even more interesting. I am most drawn to my partner when I see him in the studio, when she is onstage, when he is in his element, when she's doing somethingshe's passionate about, when I see him at a partyand other people are really drawn to him, when I see her hold court."}, {"zh-tw": "基本上，這些都是看到了對方光彩照人、自信煥發的時刻，這可能是最重大、最全方位的興奮點", "en": "Basically, when I look at my partnerradiant and confident. Probably the biggestturn-on across the board."}, {"zh-tw": "容光煥發，自立自足。“我凝視著這個人”——而且還帶著欲望人們很少說“當我們合而為一時”", "en": "Radiant, as in self-sustaining. I look at this person --by the way, in desire people rarely talk about it,when we are blended into one, five centimeters from each other."}, {"zh-tw": "“相距僅5公分。”我不知道(5公分)是多少英寸（但至少說明距離不太近）對方也並沒有在太遙遠的地方以至於你看不到他們", "en": "I don't know in inches how much that is. But it's also not when the other personis that far apart that you no longer see them."}, {"zh-tw": "我是在一個舒適的距離看著我的伴侶當這個我已經非常熟悉、非常瞭解的人頃刻間有變回了那個有些神秘、難以捉摸的人在我與對方的空間之中醞釀著性衝動這裡隱含著通向對方的行動", "en": "It's when I'm looking at my partnerfrom a comfortable distance, where this person that is alreadyso familiar, so known, is momentarily once againsomewhat mysterious, somewhat elusive. And in this space between meand the other lies the erotic élan, lies that movement toward the other."}, {"zh-tw": "有時候，就像普魯斯特所過的神秘“並不是去往新的風光，而在於擁有新的眼光。”因而，當我看到伴侶獨自一人在獨特的氛圍中做著擅長的事我馬上就有了一個視角的轉換我對身邊的這個謎一樣的人保持著開放之心", "en": "Because sometimes, as Proust says, mystery is notabout traveling to new places, but it's about looking with new eyes. And so, when I see my partneron his own or her own, doing somethingin which they are enveloped, I look at this person and I momentarilyget a shift in perception, and I stay open to the mysteriesthat are living right next to me."}, {"zh-tw": "更重要的一點是，在這條關於對方的描述中關於自己的描述也一樣，有一點尤其有趣那就是欲望中無所謂需要誰也不需要誰", "en": "And then, more importantly,in this description about the other or myself -- it's the same -- what is most interestingis that there is no neediness in desire. Nobody needs anybody."}, {"zh-tw": "欲望中沒有關懷", "en": "There is no caretaking in desire. Caretaking is mightily loving."}, {"zh-tw": "關懷絕對屬於愛情的範疇，它能夠強力地消除性欲我還未見到過有誰的衝動來源於需要他們的人", "en": "It's a powerful anti-aphrodisiac. I have yet to see somebodywho is so turned on by somebody who needs them."}, {"zh-tw": "渴望對方能激發衝動，需要對方卻能阻止衝動女性向來深知這點任何能激發母性的東西一般都能降低情欲水準", "en": "Wanting them is one thing. Needing them is a shot down and women have known that forever, because anythingthat will bring up parenthood will usually decrease the erotic charge."}, {"zh-tw": "這並非毫無道理吧？第三組共同的回答通常會是“當我感覺驚訝時，當我們一起歡笑時”今天有人在辦公室告訴我：“當他穿上燕尾服的時候。”你們知道，要不就是燕尾服，要不就是牛仔靴但基本上，都是出現了新穎元素的情形", "en": "For good reasons, right? And then the third groupof answers usually would be: when I'm surprised,when we laugh together, as somebody said to mein the office today, when he's in his tux, so I said, you know, it's either the tux or the cowboy boots. But basically it's when there is novelty."}, {"zh-tw": "新穎並不是說一定要有新體位，以及一大堆技巧", "en": "But novelty isn't about new positions. It isn't a repertoire of techniques."}, {"zh-tw": "新穎的關鍵是，你要表現自己的哪些部分？你要把哪些部分拿給對方看？在某種意義上，我們可以說性愛的奧妙並不在於你做了什麼而在於你要達到什麼境界對自己對他人皆然", "en": "Novelty is, what partsof you do you bring out? What parts of you are just being seen? Because in some way one could saysex isn't something you do, eh? Sex is a place you go. It's a space you enter inside yourselfand with another, or others."}, {"zh-tw": "你要達到什麼境界？你連結了哪些部分？你追求什麼樣的表達？是一種超脫的靈魂結合嗎？是調皮搗蛋嗎？是安全地挑釁嗎？是要終於示一示弱，不再需要事事兼顧嗎？是不是要表達孩子氣的願望？你想要什麼結果？這是一種語言，而不僅僅是一種行為。", "en": "So where do you go in sex? What parts of you do you connect to? What do you seek to express there? Is it a place for transcendenceand spiritual union? Is it a place for naughtinessand is it a place to be safely aggressive? Is it a place where youcan finally surrender and not have to takeresponsibility for everything? Is it a place where you canexpress your infantile wishes? What comes out there? It's a language. It isn't just a behavior."}, {"zh-tw": "這種語言的詩意所在才是我感興趣的也是我之所以開始研究“愛欲情商”這個概念的原因大家都知道動物的性行為", "en": "And it's the poetic of that languagethat I'm interested in, which is why I began to explorethis concept of erotic intelligence. You know, animals have sex."}, {"zh-tw": "這是一個重點，是生物學，是自然本能。人類是唯一具有性生活的物種這表明人類的性行為經過了想像力的加工轉換", "en": "It's the pivot, it's biology,it's the natural instinct. We are the only oneswho have an erotic life, which means that it's sexualitytransformed by the human imagination."}, {"zh-tw": "唯獨人類的性愛可以持續數小時之久飄飄欲仙，數次高潮完成這些甚至可以全靠想像而無需觸碰任何人我們可以靠暗示，甚至無需付諸動作", "en": "We are the only oneswho can make love for hours, have a blissful time, multiple orgasms, and touch nobody,just because we can imagine it. We can hint at it.We don't even have to do it."}, {"zh-tw": "期盼是我們能體驗到的一種強大的武器來產生欲望仿佛身臨其境的想像力沒有什麼實際事件發生而能產生精神體驗還是甚為豐富的精神體驗", "en": "We can experience that powerfulthing called anticipation, which is a mortar to desire. The ability to imagine it,as if it's happening, to experience it as if it's happening, while nothing is happening and everything is happening,at the same time."}, {"zh-tw": "我開始思考性喚起開始研究關於性的詩歌如果它是一種智慧就說明它是能夠被培養的", "en": "So when I began to think about eroticism, I began to think about the poetics of sex. And if I look at it as an intelligence, then it's something that you cultivate."}, {"zh-tw": "它的構成元素是什麼？想像、戲謔新穎、好奇、神秘。但其中最關鍵的部分當屬想像力", "en": "What are the ingredients? Imagination, playfulness, novelty, curiosity, mystery. But the central agent is reallythat piece called the imagination."}, {"zh-tw": "但對我的研究更為重要的是要想明白激情四射的夫妻都有什麼特徵欲望又是靠什麼來維持的我需要重新審視性喚起的定義這一神秘的定義我從反面來看待這個問題去檢驗“創傷”的定義我來到小時候居住的社區那是一個居住著大屠殺倖存者的比利時的社區在那裡有兩組人一組是大難不死，一組是劫後還生", "en": "But more importantly,for me to begin to understand who are the coupleswho have an erotic spark, what sustains desire, I had to go backto the original definition of eroticism, the mystical definition, and I went through itthrough a bifurcation by looking, actually, at trauma, which is the other side. And I looked at it, looking at the communitythat I had grown up in, which was a community in Belgium,all Holocaust survivors, and in my community,there were two groups: those who didn't die,and those who came back to life."}, {"zh-tw": "大難不死的那組人往往苟且偷生無法感受歡樂，也無法給予信任，因為他們小心翼翼，煩惱重重，憂慮無數，擔驚受怕，就無法抬頭挺胸，就無法堂堂正正地享受歡樂、心安，就無法充滿想像力；而劫後還生的那組人他們認為性喚起是死亡的一劑解藥", "en": "And those who didn't die livedoften very tethered to the ground, could not experiencepleasure, could not trust, because when you're vigilant,worried, anxious, and insecure, you can't lift your headto go and take off in space and be playful and safe and imaginative. Those who came back to life were those who understoodthe erotic as an antidote to death."}, {"zh-tw": "他們知道如何求生當我為缺乏性生活的夫妻提供諮詢時常常聽到他們說“我想要更多的性愛”但通常人們想要的是更好的性愛“更好”的意思是要把性重新變得充滿活力、生機、更新、持續、性和能量，就像性愛從前能帶給他們的那樣，或者說他們認為如此。", "en": "They knew how to keep themselves alive. And when I began to listen to the sexlessnessof the couples that I work with, I sometimes would hear peoplesay, \"I want more sex,\" but generally, people want better sex, and better is to reconnectwith that quality of aliveness, of vibrancy, of renewal, of vitality, of Eros, of energy that sex used to afford them, or that they've hopedit would afford them."}, {"zh-tw": "於是我問了另外一個問題：“我在什麼情況下讓自己性致全無？”成了新的問題。", "en": "And so I began to aska different question. \"I shut myself off when ...\"began to be the question."}, {"zh-tw": "“我在什麼情況下熄滅了自己的欲火？”這與先前的問題不一樣：“是什麼讓我性致全無？”“你在什麼情況下讓我性致全無？”人們開始回答“我讓自己性致全無的原因有，是我覺得了無生趣，當我不喜歡自己的身體，當我感到年華老去，沒有屬於自己的時間當我找不到機會跟你好好談談，當我工作不順，當我不再自信，當我感到自己的存在沒什麼價值，當我感覺自己沒有權利去渴求，去索取，去享受歡樂。”然後我詢問了相反的問題：“我在什麼情況下性致勃勃？”因為多數時候，人們喜歡問的重點是：“你激發了我，”“外物激發了我，”而“我”本人不在問題的考量之中。如果你自身感覺了無生趣，就算另一伴為了過情人節做很多事", "en": "\"I turn off my desires when ...\" Which is not the same question as, \"What turns me off is ...\"and \"You turn me off when ...\" And people began to say,\"I turn myself off when I feel dead inside,when I don't like my body, when I feel old, when I haven't had time for myself, when I haven't had a chanceto even check in with you, when I don't perform well at work, when I feel low self esteem, when I don't have a sense of self-worth, when I don't feel like I havea right to want, to take, to receive pleasure.\" And then I began to askthe reverse question. \"I turn myself on when ...\" Because most of the time,people like to ask the question, \"You turn me on, what turns me on,\" and I'm out of the question, you know? Now, if you are dead inside, the other person can doa lot of things for Valentine's."}, {"zh-tw": "而你毫無感覺，因為沒人在前臺接待。所以，關鍵是“我”如何激發自己，“我”被欲望喚起的情形有哪些。", "en": "It won't make a dent.There is nobody at the reception desk. So I turn myself on when, I turn on my desires, I wake up when ..."}, {"zh-tw": "在愛和欲的悖論之中似乎最令人費解的就是滋養愛的那些要素：親密、互惠、保護、牽腸掛肚、對對方負責——這些要素恰恰能扼殺欲因為產生欲的諸多因素恰恰無益於愛：嫉妒、佔有欲、侵略性、權力、支配、頑皮、胡鬧。", "en": "Now, in this paradoxbetween love and desire, what seems to be so puzzling is that the very ingredientsthat nurture love -- mutuality, reciprocity, protection, worry,responsibility for the other -- are sometimes the very ingredientsthat stifle desire. Because desire comeswith a host of feelings that are not alwayssuch favorites of love: jealousy, possessiveness, aggression, power, dominance, naughtiness, mischief."}, {"zh-tw": "基本上，夜幕之下讓我們蠢蠢欲動的東西正是我們光天白日反對的東西我們的情色心可不管自己心理是否政治正確。", "en": "Basically most of us will get turned onat night by the very same things that we will demonstrateagainst during the day. You know, the erotic mindis not very politically correct."}, {"zh-tw": "如果每個人在一床玫瑰中都能想入非非，那麼我們也就不可能進行這次有趣的對話了。事情絕非如此簡單。我們很難把情色心裡萌發的那些東西傳達給我們的愛人因為我們認為愛是無私的，事實上，欲望需要一定程度的自私，從個最好的方面說：就是在他人存在的前提下保持自我的能力。", "en": "If everybody was fantasizingon a bed of roses, we wouldn't be having suchinteresting talks about this. But no, in our mind up thereare a host of things going on that we don't always knowhow to bring to the person that we love, because we think lovecomes with selflessness and in fact desire comeswith a certain amount of selfishness in the best sense of the word: the ability to stay connectedto one's self in the presence of another."}, {"zh-tw": "大概地總結一下，就是需要我們去調和兩組與生俱來的需求對聯繫和分離的需求，對安定和冒險的需求，對團結和對自主的需求拿小孩子來打比方，剛開始孩子總是坐在父母的膝上舒舒服服地窩著，又安全又放鬆，但所有的孩子在某一天都要掙開這個懷抱去看世界，去發現、去探索。", "en": "So I want to drawthat little image for you, because this need to reconcilethese two sets of needs, we are born with that. Our need for connection,our need for separateness, or our need for security and adventure, or our need for togethernessand for autonomy, and if you think about the little kidwho sits on your lap and who is cozily nested hereand very secure and comfortable, and at some point all of usneed to go out into the world to discover and to explore."}, {"zh-tw": "這就是欲望的開端。探索需要好奇心和探究心。過了一會兒，孩子們肯定要回頭看你", "en": "That's the beginning of desire, that exploratory need,curiosity, discovery. And then at some point they turnaround and they look at you."}, {"zh-tw": "如果你這時候告訴他們：“孩子，世界很奇妙，放手去探索吧！會有很多樂趣的。”這樣說了，他們就能轉身離開，並同時體驗到聯繫和分離。", "en": "And if you tell them, \"Hey kiddo, the world's a great place. Go for it. There's so much fun out there,\" then they can turn awayand they can experience connection and separatenessat the same time."}, {"zh-tw": "他們能盡情想像，盡情探索，盡情玩樂，同時確信回轉時總有人等著他們。但是，如果另一方說：“我擔心、焦慮、絕望。", "en": "They can go off in their imagination,off in their body, off in their playfulness, all the while knowing that there'ssomebody when they come back.

I'm depressed."}, {"zh-tw": "我的伴侶已經很長時間沒有照顧到我了。外面有什麼好的？我們難道不是已經擁有了在一起所需要的一切，那就是你和我嗎？”這樣一來就會產生一些我們毫不陌生的反應。", "en": "My partner hasn't taken careof me in so long. What's so good out there? Don't we have everythingyou need together, you and I?\" then there are a few little reactions that all of us can pretty much recognize."}, {"zh-tw": "我們中的一些人早早地回轉過來像那個回轉過來的孩子一樣他放棄了自己的某些東西只為了不要失去對方。我放棄了自由，這樣就不會失去與你的關聯；", "en": "Some of us will come back, came back a long time ago, and that little child who comes back is the child who will forgoa part of himself in order not to lose the other. I will lose my freedomin order not to lose connection."}, {"zh-tw": "我要學會一種愛你的方式那將會負擔更多擔憂、更多責任、以及更多保護；我不會離開你出去玩樂、體會歡愉，去探索未知，深入自我。把這些翻譯成大人的語言", "en": "And I will learn to love in a certain way that will become burdened with extra worry and extra responsibilityand extra protection, and I won't know how to leave you in order to go play,in order to go experience pleasure, in order to discover,to enter inside myself.

Are you going to curse me, scold me? Are you going to be angry with me?\" And they may be gone,but they're never really away."}, {"zh-tw": "這些人經常告訴你一開始他們打得火熱因為逐漸增加的親密感並沒有強到能減輕欲望但當我們越來越親密，我就感到更多的責任，我就更加離不開你", "en": "And those are often the peoplethat will tell you, \"In the beginning, it was super hot.\" Because in the beginning, the growing intimacy wasn't yet so strong that it actually ledto the decrease of desire.
