Now, in terms of biomimetics, as human technologies take on more of the characteristics of nature, nature becomes a much more useful teacher.", "zh-tw": "我把這個學科定義為生物學與其他學科間的互動，每一個學科都會互相受惠於其他學科，但是集眾學科之力，其成果將超越單一學科領域。以生物模仿學來說，由於人類科技從自然界學習到許多東西，大自然就成了一個全能的老師。"}, {"en": "Engineering can be inspired by biology by using its principles and analogies when they're advantageous, but then integrating that with the best human engineering, ultimately to make something actually better than nature.

One thing I want to point out is, look at Stickybot. You see something on it. It's not just to look like a gecko.", "zh-tw": "噢，我想要講一件事，看看那個機器人，你會看到有一個東西在上面，它不只是看起來像一隻壁虎而已，"}, {"en": "It has a tail.

Pretty powerful.", "zh-tw": "也可以用來防衛，很有力的工具。"}, {"en": "So we then went back and looked at the animal.

The engineers had a really good idea.", "zh-tw": "真的很不可思議！這些工程師的想法真的很棒！"}, {"en": "And then of course we wondered, okay, they have an active tail, but let's picture them. They're climbing up a wall, or a tree.", "zh-tw": "我們當然會想，好，他們的尾巴有作用，那麼再想想看，如果他們爬上一堵牆，或一棵樹，"}, {"en": "And they get to the top and let's say there's some leaves there. And what would happen if they climbed on the underside of that leaf, and there was some wind, or we shook it? And we did that experiment, that you see here.", "zh-tw": "然後爬到頂端有樹葉的部分，如果他們爬到樹葉背面的時候，剛好有風吹過來，或者我們搖晃那個樹幹，結果會怎樣？所以我們做了那個實驗，你看看。"}, {"en": "And this is what we discovered. Now that's real time. You can't see anything.", "zh-tw": "這是我們拍攝的影片，用正常速度播放，你什麼都看不到，"}, {"en": "But there it is slowed down. What we discovered was the world's fastest air-righting response.", "zh-tw": "所以放慢速度。我們看到世界上最快的空中翻轉，"}, {"en": "For those of you who remember your physics, that's a zero-angular-momentum righting response. But it's like a cat. You know, cats falling. Cats do this. They twist their bodies.", "zh-tw": "你們如果還記得一點物理常識的話，這就是角動量為零的反應。但它的動作看起來像貓，就像貓掉下來的反應，貓也會這樣，他們會旋轉自己的身體。"}, {"en": "But geckos do it better. And they do it with their tail.", "zh-tw": "但是壁虎做得更好，因為他們會運用自己的尾巴。"}, {"en": "So they do it with this active tail as they swing around. And then they always land in the sort of superman skydiving posture.", "zh-tw": "當他們在旋轉的時候，有用到尾巴的力量，所以降落的時候就像超人在空中下降的姿勢一樣。"}, {"en": "Okay, now we wondered, if we were right, we should be able to test this in a physical model, in a robot. So for TED we actually built a robot, over there, a prototype, with the tail.", "zh-tw": "接下來我們想，如果我們想得沒錯，我們應該在實體模型上測試一下，就是在機器人上測試。為了TED，我們真的打造了一個機器人，是原型機器人，有尾巴的哦。"}, {"en": "And we're going to attempt the first air-righting response in a tail, with a robot. If we could have the lights on it.", "zh-tw": "所以我們打算在這個有尾巴的機器人身上，測試第一次的空中翻轉。請打開燈光，"}, {"en": "Okay, there it goes. And show the video.", "zh-tw": "好，可以開始了。請看影片，"}, {"en": "There it is. And it works just like it does in the animal.", "zh-tw": "就是這樣，就像是動物的動作一樣。"}, {"en": "So all you need is a swing of the tail to right yourself. Now, of course, we were normally frightened because the animal has no gliding adaptations, so we thought, \"Oh that's okay. We'll put it in a vertical wind tunnel.", "zh-tw": "所以你只需要一條尾巴來幫助你旋轉。我們會覺得驚訝，是因為壁虎並沒有滑翔的本領，所以我們想：「好吧，我們把壁虎放進一個垂直的風管，"}, {"en": "We'll blow the air up, we'll give it a landing target, a tree trunk, just outside the plexi-glass enclosure, and see what it does. So we did. And here is what it does.", "zh-tw": "吹氣上來，然後設定一個降落點，就設定一個樹幹吧...放在塑膠玻璃圍籬的外面，看看它的反應如何。」我們真的做了，請看影片。"}, {"en": "So the wind is coming from the bottom. This is slowed down 10 times. It does an equilibrium glide. Highly controlled.", "zh-tw": "風會從底下吹上來，這是速度放慢十倍的影片，它滑翔得非常平穩，控制得非常好，"}, {"en": "This is sort of incredible. But actually it's quite beautiful, when you take a picture of it. And it's better than that, it -- just in the slide -- maneuvers in mid-air.", "zh-tw": "真是令人不敢相信！你如果替它照張相，其實還挺美的呢！還不只這樣，在它滑動的時候，它還可以在空中轉向，"}, {"en": "And the way it does it, is it takes its tail and it swings it one way to yaw left, and it swings its other way to yaw right. So we can maneuver this way.", "zh-tw": "它將尾巴擺動向一邊好向左偏轉，然後再擺動向另一邊再向右偏轉，就是靠這個動作來轉向的。"}, {"en": "And then -- we had to film this several times to believe this -- it also does this. Watch this. It oscillates its tail up and down like a dolphin.", "zh-tw": "還有，我們看了好幾次影片才相信它會做這個動作，看，它還會做這個動作，它會像海豚一樣上下擺動尾巴，"}, {"en": "It can actually swim through the air. But watch its front legs. Can you see what they are doing? What does that mean for the origin of flapping flight? Maybe it's evolved from coming down from trees, and trying to control a glide.", "zh-tw": "就像在空中游泳一樣。再看看它的前腳，看到它在做什麼嗎？像不像在振翅飛翔？或許這是由樹上下來的動作演化而來，然後它試著做得像滑翔一樣。"}, {"en": "Stay tuned for that. So then we wondered, \"Can they actually maneuver with this?\" So there is the landing target. Could they steer towards it with these capabilities? Here it is in the wind tunnel.", "zh-tw": "別轉台哦！然後我們又想：「他們真的能夠控制方向嗎？」所以我們設了一個降落點，看他們能不能降落在那裡？現在它在風管裡，"}, {"en": "And it certainly looks like it. You can see it even better from down on top.", "zh-tw": "它好像很享受的樣子，你看到它上升的時候做得更好，"}, {"en": "Watch the animal. Definitely moving towards the landing target.", "zh-tw": "看看這隻壁虎，完全朝降落點前進。"}, {"en": "Watch the whip of its tail as it does it. Look at that. It's unbelievable.", "zh-tw": "看看它尾巴的擺動，你看看，真是令人不敢相信！"}, {"en": "So now we were really confused, because there are no reports of it gliding. So we went, \"Oh my god, we have to go to the field, and see if it actually does this.\" Completely opposite of the way you'd see it on a nature film, of course.", "zh-tw": "我們有點搞不清楚了，因為以前從來沒有人說過壁虎會滑翔。所以我們想：「天啊！我們得到野外去，看看野外的壁虎是不是真的會滑翔。」這完全和你看的野生動物影片製作的觀點相反，"}, {"en": "We wondered, \"Do they actually glide in nature?\" Well we went to the forests of Singapore and Southeast Asia. And the next video you see is the first time we've showed this.", "zh-tw": "我們想：「他們真的會在野外滑翔嗎？」我們跑到新加坡和東南亞的森林裡去，等會兒你們將會看到首次公開播映的影片。"}, {"en": "This is the actual video -- not staged, a real research video -- of animal gliding down. There is a red trajectory line. Look at the end to see the animal.", "zh-tw": "這是真實的野外影片，不是設計過的，是真的研究壁虎滑翔下來的影片--那兒有一條紅色的滑翔線，在末端可以看到壁虎，"}, {"en": "But then as it gets closer to the tree, look at the close-up. And see if you can see it land. So there it comes down. There is a gecko at the end of that trajectory line.", "zh-tw": "當它靠近樹的時候，要注意看特寫鏡頭，看看你是否能看到它降落的畫面。它下來了，有一隻壁虎在滑翔線的末端，"}, {"en": "You see it there? There? Watch it come down. Now watch up there and you can see the landing. Did you see it hit? It actually uses its tail too, just like we saw in the lab.", "zh-tw": "看到了嗎？在那裡，它下來了，你看上面的特寫鏡頭就會看到它降落的畫面，看到了嗎？它真的有用它的尾巴幫忙，就像我們在實驗室裡看到的一樣。"}, {"en": "So now we can continue this mutualism by suggesting that they can make an active tail. And here is the first active tail, in the robot, made by Boston Dynamics.", "zh-tw": "所以我們可以繼續這種互惠的機制，告訴這些工程師他們可以製作一條有作用的尾巴。這是第一個裝設有作用的尾巴的機器人，由Boston Dynamics製作。"}, {"en": "So to conclude, I think we need to build biomutualisms, like I showed, that will increase the pace of basic discovery in their application. To do this though, we need to redesign education in a major way, to balance depth with interdisciplinary communication, and explicitly train people how to contribute to, and benefit from other disciplines.", "zh-tw": "結論是，我覺得我們應該建立生物互惠學的機制，就像我所展示的，這樣會增進基礎科學進步的腳步。但要做到這一步，我們必須對教育做出重大改變，以加強各學科間溝通的深度，並讓各學科的專家有機會教學相長。"}, {"en": "And of course you need the organisms and the environment to do it. That is, whether you care about security, search and rescue or health, we must preserve nature's designs, otherwise these secrets will be lost forever.", "zh-tw": "當然這需要環境的配合，以及適當的機制。不管你在不在乎安全、搜救、救援或健康，我們都必須保護大自然的設計，否則這些祕密將會永遠遺失。"}, {"en": "And from what I heard from our new president, I'm very optimistic. Thank you.", "zh-tw": "而我從新任總統的談話中得知，我可以對這件事抱持樂觀的態度，謝謝各位。"}], "title": "Robert Full Learning From The Gecko S Tail", "url": "http://www.ted.com/talks/robert_full_learning_from_the_gecko_s_tail"}
