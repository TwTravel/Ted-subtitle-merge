António Guterres: Pleasure. BG: Let's start with a figure."}, {"zh-tw": "2015年期間，將近有 100 萬難民和移民從不同國家湧入歐洲，當然，也有來自敘利亞及伊拉克，也有來自於阿富汗、孟加拉、厄立特里亞等其他國家的。人民對此亦有兩種不同的反應：有歡迎的國家也有拒絕的國家。", "en": "During 2015, almost one million refugeesand migrants arrived in Europe from many different countries, of course, from Syria and Iraq,but also from Afghanistan and Bangladesh and Eritrea and elsewhere. And there have been reactionsof two different kinds: welcoming parties and border fences."}, {"zh-tw": "但我想從短期和長期的角度來探討這個問題。第一條問題十分簡單：為何難民潮近六個月急速增加？AG：我認為，基本上，會有這麼大的升幅主要是由敘利亞的難民所引發的。", "en": "But I want to look at it a little bit from the short-termand the long-term perspective. And the first question is very simple: Why has the movement of refugeesspiked so fast in the last six months? AG: Well, I think, basically,what triggered this huge increase was the Syrian refugee group."}, {"zh-tw": "來自非洲或亞洲移入歐洲的移民數一直以來都在增長，但成長得很慢，但突然間，今年年初的幾個月，移民數量突然增加。為什麼？我認為有三個原因，兩個是長期因素及一個是觸發點。", "en": "There has been an increased movementinto Europe from Africa, from Asia, but slowly growing, and all of a suddenwe had this massive increase in the first months of this year. Why? I think there are three reasons, two long-term ones and the trigger."}, {"zh-tw": "長期因素與敘利亞人有關，他們越來越看不到希望。我意思是，他們雖然看著自己的國家，但看不到回家的希望，因為政治上沒有解決方法，像看不見隧道的盡頭一樣。", "en": "The long-term ones,in relation to Syrians, is that hope is less and lessclear for people. I mean, they look at their own country and they don't see much hopeto go back home, because there is no political solution, so there is no lightat the end of the tunnel."}, {"zh-tw": "第二，敘利亞難民在鄰近國家的生存條件持續惡化。我們剛和世界銀行做了研究，87%住在約旦的敘利亞人和97%住坐在黎巴嫩的敘利亞人均生活於全國的貧困線之下。", "en": "Second, the living conditions of the Syrians in the neighboringcountries have been deteriorating. We just had research with the World Bank, and 87 percent of the Syrians in Jordan and 93 percent of the Syrians in Lebanon live below the national poverty lines."}, {"zh-tw": "只有一半的兒童能上學，這表示人民生活十分艱辛不僅僅是因為是難民們離鄉背井，還有一直遭受著的磨難，他們同時還生活在非常非常困苦的條件中。", "en": "Only half of the children go to school, which means that peopleare living very badly. Not only are they refugees, out of home, not only have they sufferedwhat they have suffered, but they are living in very,very dramatic conditions."}, {"zh-tw": "再來就是這個觸發點突然之間國際援助減少了由於資源匱乏，世界糧食計劃署被迫減少30%對敘利亞難民的食物供給。", "en": "And then the triggerwas when all of a sudden, international aid decreased. The World Food Programme was forced,for lack of resources, to cut by 30 percent food supportto the Syrian refugees."}, {"zh-tw": "難民不被允許工作，所以他們完全依賴國際支援他們更覺得：「世界正在遺棄我們」我認為這就是觸發點。突然之間，風湧而至，人們開始大批遷移。說真的，如果我也面臨相同的狀況，並且有足夠的勇氣，我也會那樣做的。", "en": "They're not allowed to work, so they are totally dependenton international support, and they felt, \"The worldis abandoning us.\" And that, in my opinion, was the trigger. All of a sudden, there was a rush, and people started to movein large numbers and, to be absolutely honest, if I had been in the same situation and I would have been braveenough to do it, I think I would have done the same."}, {"zh-tw": "BG：不過我認為令人意外的並不僅僅是事發突然，而是事情本不該發生得如此突然。敘利亞的戰爭已經五年了。", "en": "BG: But I think what surprisedmany people is it's not only sudden, but it wasn't supposed to be sudden. The war in Syria has beenhappening for five years."}, {"zh-tw": "上百萬的難民居住在敘利亞周邊的難民營、村莊及城鎮您自己也曾提醒過會有這種狀況，還有，像是您有提到利比亞政府垮台的結果但是歐洲看起來似乎毫無準備。", "en": "Millions of refugees are in campsand villages and towns around Syria. You have yourself warnedabout the situation and about the consequencesof a breakdown of Libya, for example, and yet Europe looked totally unprepared."}, {"zh-tw": "AG:：毫無準備是因為意見分歧，當你意見分歧又不想面對現實時你就會選擇遲一點再決定，因為你沒有能力接納那麼多難民。", "en": "AG: Well, unprepared because divided, and when you are divided,you don't want to recognize the reality. You prefer to postpone decisions, because you do not havethe capacity to make them."}, {"zh-tw": "證據是，即使當移民潮發生後，歐洲各國仍然意見分歧，也未能提出適當的機制來管理局面你剛剛提到有 100 萬難民，", "en": "And the proof is that even whenthe spike occurred, Europe remained divided and was unable to put in placea mechanism to manage the situation. You talk about one million people."}, {"zh-tw": "看起來很多，但歐盟總人口數是 5.5 億，即每2000個歐洲人對應1個難民。在黎巴嫩，每三個黎巴嫩人就要應對一個難民。", "en": "It looks enormous, but the population of the European Unionis 550 million people, which means we are talking about oneper every [550] Europeans. Now, in Lebanon, we have one refugeeper three Lebanese."}, {"zh-tw": "而黎巴嫩？很艱辛，當然，但是他們做到了。所以問題是：這些是本應可以控制--暫時先不提最重要而且一直被強調的根本原因現在也先不要管問題的成因，就只看現象本身--歐洲是否能團結一致在入境處創造充足的接納能力？但要做到如此，各國的入境處需要被大量的支援，然後對入境難民進行安檢，並配合其他機制及根據每個國家的能力來分配這些湧入歐洲的難民，", "en": "And Lebanon? Struggling,of course, but it's managing. So, the question is: is this somethingthat could have been managed if -- not mentioning the mostimportant thing, which would have beenaddressing the root causes, but forgetting about root causes for now, looking at the phenomenon as it is -- if Europe were able to cometogether in solidarity to create an adequatereception capacity of entry points? But for that, the countries at entrypoints need to be massively supported, and then screening the peoplewith security checks and all the other mechanisms, distributing those that are cominginto all European countries, according to the possibilitiesof each country."}, {"zh-tw": "我的意思是，如果你去看一下委員會批准的重新安置計劃，總是太少、太遲或者由市議會批准的也是太少、太遲BG：現在已經失敗了AG：我的國家原本應該接收四千人", "en": "I mean, if you look atthe relocation program that was approved by the Commission,always too little too late, or by the Council, too little too late -- BG: It's already breaking down. AG: My country is supposedto receive four thousand."}, {"zh-tw": "四千人對葡萄牙來說不算什麼。所以說，如果處理得當，難民都可以得到妥善安置。但現在是入境處壓力很大之後難民毫無秩序地穿過巴爾幹，來到德國、瑞典及奧地利，", "en": "Four thousand in Portugal means nothing. So this is perfectly manageableif it is managed, but in the present circumstances,the pressure is at the point of entry, and then, as people movein this chaotic way through the Balkans, then they come to Germany,Sweden, basically, and Austria."}, {"zh-tw": "只有這三個國家接收難民。其它歐洲國家只是冷眼旁觀。", "en": "They are the three countries that are,in the end, receiving the refugees. The rest of Europe is lookingwithout doing much."}, {"zh-tw": "BG: 讓我再問三個問題，扮演一下魔鬼的支持者，我會嘗試問問題，讓他們頭昏腦脹，", "en": "BG: Let me try to bring upthree questions, playing a bit devil's advocate. I'll try to ask them, make them blunt."}, {"zh-tw": "但我認為這個問題在歐洲很多人的心理面是個相當現實的問題。首先，當然是難民的數字你說5.5億比100萬不算多，但現實上歐洲可容納多少人？AG：這個問題沒有答案因為難民有權被受保護。", "en": "But I think the questions are very present in the minds of many peoplein Europe right now, The first, of course, is about numbers. You say 550 million versus one millionis not much, but realistically, how many people can Europe take? AG: Well, that is a questionthat has no answer, because refugees havethe right to be protected."}, {"zh-tw": "國際法中也有這樣的規定，所以你不能說：「我只收一萬人，不要再來了」我提醒你一件事：土耳其在危機開始前，記得有位部長說，“ 土耳其最多只能接納10萬人。”但現在，大約共有230萬難民居住在土耳其。所以我覺得，我認為我們不應該討論歐洲能接納多少難民，", "en": "And there is such a thingas international law, so there is no way you can say,\"I take 10,000 and that's finished.\" I remind you of one thing: in Turkey, at the beginning of the crisis,I remember one minister saying, \"Turkey will be able to receiveup to 100,000 people.\" Turkey has now two millionthree-hundred thousand or something of the sort,if you count all refugees. So I don't think it's fair to sayhow many we can take."}, {"zh-tw": "而是應該討論的是：我們要如何組織自己來履行我們的國際責任。歐洲還不能做到這一點，因為基本上，歐洲是分裂的，並沒有團結起來共同解決歐洲問題。而且不僅是在難民問題上，在其他領域也是。", "en": "What it is fair to say is:how we can we organize ourselves to assume our internationalresponsibilities? And Europe has not been able to do so, because basically, Europe is dividedbecause there is no solidarity in the European project. And it's not only about refugees;there are many other areas."}, {"zh-tw": "我們說實話，現在這個時刻，我們需要更多歐洲國家參與，而非更少。但因為大家越來越不相信歐盟機構，所以當要說服人們，我們需要更多歐盟國家來解決問題的時候就越來越困難。", "en": "And let's be honest, this is the momentin which we need more Europe instead of less Europe. But as the public less and less believesin European institutions, it is also each time more difficultto convince the public that we need more Europeto solve these problems."}, {"zh-tw": "BG：我們似乎在一個情況下就是難民數量會引響政策轉移，特別是國家內政。比如這個周末，我們又再次看到法國頒布的政策，我們也有看到其他國家也有這種狀況：比如波蘭、丹麥、瑞士，等等，因為難民的數量而突然轉變，雖然他們在絕對數字上改變並不明顯，", "en": "BG: We seem to be at the point where the numbers turn into politicalshifts, particularly domestically. We saw it again this weekend in France, but we have seen it overand over in many countries: in Poland and in Denmarkand in Switzerland and elsewhere, where the mood changes radicallybecause of the numbers, although they are not very significantin absolute numbers."}, {"zh-tw": "（某國的）首相……AG：請容許我插句話，我談一下這些事：我的意思是，在歐洲一個沒有移民的小村莊里，人們在家裡能明白甚麼？在幾個月前的每一天，打開電視新聞播的，就是大量人群湧入，不受控制，從這個邊境到那個邊境，電視畫面裡就是成千上百的人湧入歐洲。那狀況就好像沒人在乎這件事一樣--事情發生了，沒人要管理。", "en": "The Prime Minister of -- AG: But, if I may, on these: I mean, what does a European see at home in a village where there are no migrants? What a European sees is, on television, every single day, a few months ago,opening the news every single day, a crowd coming, uncontrolled, moving from border to border, and the images on televisionwere of hundreds or thousands of people moving. And the idea is that nobodyis taking care of it -- this is happening without anykind of management."}, {"zh-tw": "所以，他們會有一種想法就是，＂他們要來我的村莊了。＂所以就有了一種完全錯誤的想法：歐洲要被侵略了，而我們的生活將會改變，所有事情都會--問題在於，如果一切都能被妥善管理，如果難民被適當地接收、歡迎在入境處接受安檢、安置，然後坐飛機送往其他歐洲國家，這樣就不會讓人們害怕了。但，很不幸，我們有很多人都很害怕，就是因為歐洲沒適當地處理問題。", "en": "And so their idea was,\"They are coming to my village.\" So there was this completely false ideathat Europe was being invaded and our way of life is going to change,and everything will -- And the problem is that if thishad been properly managed, if people had been properly received, welcomed, sheltered at point of entry,screened at point of entry, and the moved by planeto different European countries, this would not have scared people. But, unfortunately, we havea lot of people scared, just because Europe was not ableto do the job properly."}, {"zh-tw": "BG：但，德國有一些300人居住的村莊，卻有1000個難民。您對此是怎麼看的？您覺得當地居民會作何反應？AG：這種狀況如果有適當的管理措施，把難民適當地送往歐洲各國，你就會有一個我剛剛提到的比例：1:2000。", "en": "BG: But there are villages in Germany with 300 inhabitants and 1,000 refugees. So, what's your position? How do you imagine these people reacting? AG: If there would be a propermanagement of the situation and the proper distributionof people all over Europe, you would always havethe percentage that I mentioned: one per each 2,000."}, {"zh-tw": "那是因為沒有適當的管理，造成我們最後完全不可能一起生活的情況，當然，如果你有這樣的村莊--在黎巴嫩，有許多這樣的村莊，敘利亞人比黎巴嫩人還要多。黎巴嫩也適應了這種情形。我並不是要求歐洲都比照辦理，讓所有歐洲的村莊都接收比當地居民更多的難民。", "en": "It is because things are notproperly managed that in the end we have situations that are totally impossible to live with,and of course if you have a village -- in Lebanon, there are many villages that have more Syrians than Lebanese;Lebanon has been living with that. I'm not asking for the sameto happen in Europe, for all European villages to havemore refugees than inhabitants."}, {"zh-tw": "我是希望歐洲把工作做好，能夠有規劃地接收難民，就像過去世界上其他國家被強迫做的那樣。BG:：如果我們看一下全球局勢，而不僅僅是歐洲……BG：BG：如果我們看一下全球局勢，而不僅是歐洲，我知道你可以列出一長條沒有真正站出來的國家清單，但我比較有興趣的是另一方，有沒有哪些國家是做正確的事呢？AG：有的，全世界有86%的難民居住在發展中國家。", "en": "What I am asking is for Europeto do the job properly, and to be able to organize itselfto receive people as other countries in the worldwere forced to do in the past.

BG: If you look at the global situation,so, not only at Europe, I know you can makea long list of countries that are not really stepping up, but I'm more interestedin the other part -- is there somebodywho's doing the right thing?

All the borders in Ethiopia are open."}, {"zh-tw": "而他們有一項名為“ 人民互助 ”的政策說明每一位難民都應該被接納。還有南蘇丹、蘇丹、索馬里亞。", "en": "And they have, as a policy, they call the \"people to people\" policythat every refugee should be received.

They have Eritreans."}, {"zh-tw": "總體來說，非洲國家非常歡迎難民的到來，而我也會這麼說，在中東和亞洲，我們也看到了敞開國門的趨勢。現在，我們看到敘利亞還有一些問題，就是敘利亞也捲入了嚴重的安全危機。但事實是有很長一段時間，中東各國的邊境都是開放的。", "en": "And, in general, African countries are extremelywelcoming of refugees coming, and I would say that in the Middle East and in Asia, we have seen a tendencyfor borders to be open. Now we see some problemswith the Syrian situation, as the Syrian situation evolvedinto also a major security crisis, but the truth is that for a large period, all borders in the Middle East were open."}, {"zh-tw": "當時巴基斯坦和伊朗的邊境開放給600萬阿富汗人進入這兩個國家。所以我會說，即使在​​今天，在發展中國家的趨勢是為難民敞開國門。", "en": "The truth is that for Afghans, the borders of Pakistan and Iranwere open for, at the time, six million Afghans that came. So I would say that even today,the trend in the developing world has been for borders to be open."}, {"zh-tw": "但在已開發國家，這些問題卻變得越來越複雜，特別是當社會輿論將庇護難民和國家安全問題混為一談的時候，在我看來是個錯誤的闡述。BG：我們等一下回來會談到這個問題。您剛剛提到世界糧食計劃署物資縮減的情況。", "en": "The trend in the developed worldis for these questions to become more and more complex, especially when there is,in the public opinion, a mixture of discussions between refugeeprotections on one side and security questions -- in my opinion,misinterpreted -- on the other side. BG: We'll come back to that too, but you mentioned the cuttingof funding and the vouchers from the World Food Programme."}, {"zh-tw": "這反映了這些組織普遍都遇到資金短缺的問題。現在全世界看起來已經醒了，你們是否得到了更多的資助和支援，還是並沒有變化？AG：我們得到了更多的支援。", "en": "That reflects the general underfundingof the organizations working on these issues. Now that the world seems to have woken up, are you getting more fundingand more support, or it's still the same? AG: We are getting more support."}, {"zh-tw": "我會說，我們正接近去年的水平。我們在夏天期間比較糟糕。", "en": "I would say that we are comingclose to the levels of last year. We were much worse during the summer."}, {"zh-tw": "但這些顯然無法解決難民的需求，也無法解決那些支持難民的國家的需求。我們在這裡簡單重新審視一下一些必要的、有關發展合作的準則、目標和優先權。", "en": "But that is clearly insufficientto address the needs of the people and address the needs of the countries that are supporting the people. And here we have a basic reviewof the criteria, the objectives, the priorities of developmentcooperation that is required."}, {"zh-tw": "舉個例子，黎巴嫩和約旦都是中等收入國家。由於它們是中等收入國家，所以無法從世界銀行獲得優惠貸款或補助。", "en": "For instance, Lebanon and Jordanare middle-income countries. Because they are middle-income countries, they cannot receive soft loansor grants from the World Bank."}, {"zh-tw": "現在這看起來很沒有道理，因為他們在為全球公共利益做貢獻。他們接納了數百萬難民，說實話，他們是區域中穩定的梁柱，他們為此面對了諸多困難，並且是我們集體安全的第一道防線。", "en": "Now, today this doesn't make any sense, because they are providinga global public good. They have millions of refugees there, and to be honest, they are pillarsof stability in the region, with all the difficulties they face, and the first line of defenseof our collective security."}, {"zh-tw": "所以，如果這些國家不是發展合作政策優先考量的對象，就真的沒道理。但他們不是，", "en": "So it doesn't make sense that these countriesare not a first priority in development cooperation policies.

BG: Have the recent attacks in Parisand the reactions to them made your job more difficult? AG: Undoubtedly."}, {"zh-tw": "BG：在哪方面？AG：這方面，我想，就是很多人對此類的恐怖攻擊的第一反應就是：關閉所有邊境，他們沒有意識到歐洲恐怖主義問題大多是在歐洲內部產生的。在敘利亞和伊拉克，有成千上萬的戰士來自歐洲，所以僅靠拒絕敘利亞人入境並不能解決問題。", "en": "BG: In what sense? AG: In the sense that, I mean,for many people the first reaction in relation to these kinds of terroristattacks is: close all borders -- not understanding that the terroristproblem in Europe is largely homegrown.

For me it is clear."}, {"zh-tw": "我深信，未來所有的社會都會是多種族、多文化、多宗教共存的。想要避免這種趨勢，在我看來，是不可能的。", "en": "For me it is clear that all societieswill be multiethnic, multicultural, multi-religious in the future.
