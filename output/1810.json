Now, there is a sound -- (Alarm clock) Ah, it worked! A sound that is desperatelyfamiliar to most of us, and of course it's the soundof the alarm clock."}, {"zh-tw": "那悲慘又糟糕的聲音所要做的是中斷我們最重要的行為也就是睡眠如果你和一般人一樣一生中有 36% 的時間都花在睡覺上換言之，如果你活到 90 歲有整整 32 年的時間是在睡覺", "en": "And what that truly ghastly,awful sound does is stop the single most importantbehavioral experience that we have, and that's sleep. If you're an average sort of person, 36 percent of your lifewill be spent asleep, which means that if you live to 90, then 32 years will havebeen spent entirely asleep."}, {"zh-tw": "從這 32 年我們可以看出睡覺有某種程度上的重要性然而，大多數的人都認為睡覺沒什麼", "en": "Now what that 32 years is telling usis that sleep at some level is important. And yet, for most of us,we don't give sleep a second thought."}, {"zh-tw": "就這樣把睡眠浪費掉我們真的沒有思考過睡眠這個行為", "en": "We throw it away. We really just don't think about sleep."}, {"zh-tw": "我今天想做的就是改變你們的觀點改變你們對睡眠的看法、想法我想邀請你們來參與一場旅程我們得先回到過去", "en": "And so what I'd like to do todayis change your views, change your ideasand your thoughts about sleep. And the journeythat I want to take you on, we need to start by going back in time."}, {"zh-tw": "「享受沉重而甜蜜的睡眠甘露吧。」知道這是誰說的嗎？莎士比亞的凱薩大帝好，我再多給你們一些引言", "en": "\"Enjoy the honey-heavy dew of slumber.\" Any ideas who said that? Shakespeare's Julius Caesar. Yes, let me give you a few more quotes."}, {"zh-tw": "「噢，睡眠，噢，輕柔的睡眠，大自然的仁慈褓姆我怎麼會害怕你呢？」這也是莎士比亞，但我不說出處出自馬克白（更正：應為亨利四世，第二卷）同個時間「睡眠就像條金鍊子把健康和身體綁在一起。」湯瑪斯．德克說的，非常有遠見也是另一位伊莉莎白時代的劇作家", "en": "\"O sleep, O gentle sleep,nature's soft nurse, how have I frighted thee?\" Shakespeare again, from --I won't say it -- the Scottish play. From the same time: \"Sleep is the golden chainthat ties health and our bodies together.\" Extremely prophetic, by Thomas Dekker,another Elizabethan dramatist."}, {"zh-tw": "如果我們再往後 400 年對於睡眠的論點就有些改變這是 20 世紀初，湯瑪斯．愛迪生說的「睡覺簡直就是浪費時間，根本就是原始人留下的遺產。」碰如果我們前往 80 年代在座有些人可能記得 瑪格莉特．柴契爾被報導曾說過：「弱者才需要睡覺。」當然還有聲名狼藉的－名字是什麼來著－來自「華爾街」，聲名狼藉的 高登．蓋科 說過「金錢從不睡覺。」20 世紀的我們怎麼看待睡覺？當然，我們用愛迪生發明的燈泡來擊退黑暗，佔領了黑暗在這占領的過程中我們幾乎把睡眠當作是種疾病", "en": "But if we jump forward 400 years, the tone about sleep changes somewhat. This is from Thomas Edison,from the beginning of the 20th century: \"Sleep is a criminal waste of timeand a heritage from our cave days.\" Bang! And if we also jump into the 1980s,some of you may remember that Margaret Thatcherwas reported to have said, \"Sleep is for wimps.\" And of course the infamous --what was his name? -- the infamous Gordon Gekkofrom \"Wall Street\" said, \"Money never sleeps.\" What do we do in the 20thcentury about sleep? Well, of course, we useThomas Edison's light bulb to invade the night,and we occupied the dark, and in the process of this occupation, we've treated sleep as an illness, almost."}, {"zh-tw": "把睡眠當作是敵人我現在敢假設，大多數人都忍住不睡最糟的是，有多數人覺得睡覺是種病需要治療的一種病", "en": "We've treated it as an enemy. At most now, I suppose,we tolerate the need for sleep, and at worst perhapsmany of us think of sleep as an illness that needssome sort of a cure."}, {"zh-tw": "我們對睡眠的種種無知還真不是蓋的為什麼會這樣？為什麼不想要睡覺？因為當你睡覺的時候看起來你沒有在做什麼", "en": "And our ignorance about sleepis really quite profound. Why is it? Why do we abandonsleep in our thoughts? Well, it's because you don't do anythingmuch while you're asleep, it seems."}, {"zh-tw": "你沒有吃喝沒有發生性行為", "en": "You don't eat. You don't drink. And you don't have sex."}, {"zh-tw": "大多數的人沒有所以", "en": "Well, most of us anyway. And so, therefore it's -- Sorry."}, {"zh-tw": "睡覺完全是浪費時間，對嗎？錯事實上，睡覺對我們的身體非常重要神經科學家正開始研究它並解釋為什麼睡眠這麼重要", "en": "It's a complete waste of time, right? Wrong. Actually, sleep is an incrediblyimportant part of our biology, and neuroscientistsare beginning to explain why it's so very important."}, {"zh-tw": "從大腦開始吧這裡有個腦袋", "en": "So let's move to the brain. Now, here we have a brain."}, {"zh-tw": "這是一個社會科學家捐贈的他們說他們不知道這是什麼或是不知道該怎麼使用不好意思", "en": "This is donated by a social scientist, and they said they didn't know whatit was or indeed, how to use it, so -- Sorry. So I borrowed it."}, {"zh-tw": "我借了這個腦袋我想他們應該沒發現重點是，你們在睡覺的時候大腦不會停止運作", "en": "I don't think they noticed. OK. The point I'm trying to makeis that when you're asleep, this thing doesn't shut down."}, {"zh-tw": "事實上，有些區塊的活動量還增加了相較於清醒的狀態之下另一件關於睡眠之所以重要的事睡眠並非起於大腦單一組織而是有點像網絡", "en": "In fact, some areas of the brainare actually more active during the sleep statethan during the wake state. The other thing that's reallyimportant about sleep is that it doesn't arise from a singlestructure within the brain, but is to some extent a network property."}, {"zh-tw": "如果把大腦翻到背面我喜歡這一小部分的脊髓這叫做下丘腦下丘腦下方，有一塊很有趣的組織尤其是生理時鐘生理時鐘告訴我們什麼時候該起床什麼時候該睡覺下視丘下方那塊組織所要做的就是和下丘腦內的其他區塊外側下丘，腦側室前視核這些區塊來往", "en": "If we flip the brain on its back -- I love this little bitof spinal cord here -- this bit here is the hypothalamus, and right under there is a whole raftof interesting structures, not least the biological clock. The biological clock tells uswhen it's good to be up, when it's good to be asleep, and what that structure does is interact with a whole raft of other areaswithin the hypothalamus, the lateral hypothalamus,the ventrolateral preoptic nuclei."}, {"zh-tw": "這些區塊會發送信號到腦幹腦幹再把信號傳送出去讓腦皮層收到信號就是這塊皺褶很漂亮的區塊神經傳送素會讓我們醒著最重要的就是讓我們有意識", "en": "All of those combine, and they send projectionsdown to the brain stem here. The brain stem then projects forward and bathes the cortex,this wonderfully wrinkly bit over here, with neurotransmitters that keep us awake and essentially provide uswith our consciousness."}, {"zh-tw": "所以睡覺是起因於大腦內許多地方的互動更重要的，我們睡覺或不睡覺是因為這一系列的互動好，我們現在講到哪了？我們說到了睡眠很複雜花了人生中的 32 年", "en": "So sleep arises from a whole raft of different interactionswithin the brain, and essentially,sleep is turned on and off as a result of a rangeof interactions in here. OK. So where have we got to? We've said that sleep is complicated and it takes 32 years of our life."}, {"zh-tw": "我還沒解釋是：為什需要睡眠為什麼要睡覺？科學家對此也沒有一致的答案這也不會令人驚訝", "en": "But what I haven't explainedis what sleep is about. So why do we sleep? And it won't surpriseany of you that, of course, as scientists, we don't have a consensus."}, {"zh-tw": "有很多不同的想法解釋為什麼要睡覺我摘要其中三點第一點說的是修復這是有點直觀的假設", "en": "There are dozens of different ideasabout why we sleep, and I'm going to outline three of those. The first is sort of the restoration idea, and it's somewhat intuitive."}, {"zh-tw": "一天中，我們所消耗的精力我們會在晚上進行修補、替換、重建這種解釋可以追朔到亞里斯多德差不多是 2300 年前", "en": "Essentially, all the stuffwe've burned up during the day, we restore, we replace,we rebuild during the night. And indeed, as an explanation,it goes back to Aristotle, so that's what -- 2,300 years ago."}, {"zh-tw": "這種說法為多數人接受因為在當時人們看到是大腦內的一大堆基因在睡覺時是有在活動這些基因都和修補作用以及新陳代謝有關聯", "en": "It's gone in and out of fashion. It's fashionable at the moment because what's been shownis that within the brain, a whole raft of genes have been shownto be turned on only during sleep, and those genes are associatedwith restoration and metabolic pathways."}, {"zh-tw": "所以有證據支持修補假設那麼關於儲存精力呢？這也很直觀", "en": "So there's good evidencefor the whole restoration hypothesis. What about energy conservation? Again, perhaps intuitive."}, {"zh-tw": "睡覺重要的就是儲存卡路里不過當你把把數字加一加結果並不令人滿意", "en": "You essentially sleep to save calories. Now, when you do the sums,though, it doesn't really pan out."}, {"zh-tw": "如果你把一個在晚上睡覺或是熬夜的人這兩種人都並沒有做什麼活動他們一個晚上差不多存了 110 卡路里等同於一個熱狗麵包", "en": "If you compare an individualwho has slept at night, or stayed awakeand hasn't moved very much, the energy saving of sleepingis about 110 calories a night. Now, that's the equivalentof a hot dog bun."}, {"zh-tw": "需要這麼多時間以及步驟的睡眠經過一個晚上之後只有一個熱狗麵包的量這確實有點少所以我比較不相信儲存精力這種說法", "en": "Now, I would say that a hot dog bun is kind of a meager return for such a complicatedand demanding behavior as sleep. So I'm less convincedby the energy conservation idea."}, {"zh-tw": "吸引我的是第三種說法就是大腦運作以及記憶結合就我們所知，在你嘗試學習某樣事物如果你剝奪自己的睡眠那麼，你學習那樣事物的能力就毀了", "en": "But the third idea I'm quite attracted to, which is brain processingand memory consolidation. What we know is that,if after you've tried to learn a task, and you sleep-deprive individuals, the ability to learn that task is smashed."}, {"zh-tw": "學習能力大大降低所以睡眠和記憶有重要關連", "en": "It's really hugely attenuated. So sleep and memory consolidationis also very important."}, {"zh-tw": "然而，我們並不只是躺下來回想記得的事讓科學家感到驚奇的是我們發現新方法和解決複雜問題的能力會因為睡一覺而大大增強", "en": "However, it's not justthe laying down of memory and recalling it. What's turned out to be really exciting is that our ability to come upwith novel solutions to complex problems is hugely enhanced by a night of sleep."}, {"zh-tw": "事實上，這帶給我們 3 倍的優勢睡眠讓我們更具創造力", "en": "In fact, it's been estimatedto give us a threefold advantage. Sleeping at night enhances our creativity."}, {"zh-tw": "看起來我們腦中神經連結會有所改變重要的突觸連結(譯注：突觸負責將訊號傳往下個神經細胞)會被連接和強化而比較不重要的連結會被弱化而顯得更不重要", "en": "And what seems to be going onis that, in the brain, those neural connectionsthat are important, those synaptic connectionsthat are important, are linked and strengthened, while those that are less importanttend to fade away and be less important. OK."}, {"zh-tw": "有三個說法解釋為什麼我們需要睡眠我認為瞭解它們的細節很重要因為我們睡眠可能有很多原因但是睡眠不是浪費", "en": "So we've had three explanationsfor why we might sleep, and I think the important thing to realizeis that the details will vary, and it's probable we sleepfor multiple different reasons. But sleep is not an indulgence."}, {"zh-tw": "也不是我們可以輕忽看待的事我想睡眠可以比喻為從經濟艙升級到商務艙", "en": "It's not some sort of thing that we cantake on board rather casually. I think that sleep was oncelikened to an upgrade from economy to business class,you know, the equivalent of."}, {"zh-tw": "但是還不到頭等艙的等級關鍵在於缺乏睡眠，就沒有飛馳的思緒", "en": "It's not even an upgradefrom economy to first class. The critical thing to realize is thatif you don't sleep, you don't fly."}, {"zh-tw": "你也創造不出任何東西但我們現在社會卻希望剝奪睡眠", "en": "Essentially, you never get there. And what's extraordinaryabout much of our society these days is that we are desperately sleep-deprived."}, {"zh-tw": "讓我們來看看被剝奪的睡眠社會中很多人缺乏睡眠看看我們的睡眠計量表", "en": "So let's now look at sleep deprivation. Huge sectors of societyare sleep-deprived, and let's look at our sleep-o-meter."}, {"zh-tw": "在 50 年代，充分的證據顯示大部份人每晚睡 8 小時現在我們相較從前少睡 1.5 到 2 小時我們的睡眠落在每晚 6.5 小時的區間", "en": "So in the 1950s, good datasuggests that most of us were getting around eight hoursof sleep a night. Nowadays, we sleep one and a halfto two hours less every night, so we're in the six-and-a-half-hoursevery-night league."}, {"zh-tw": "對青少年而言這尤其嚴重他們需要睡 9 個小時以利大腦運作而大多數人在學期間每晚僅睡 5 小時", "en": "For teenagers, it's worse, much worse. They need nine hoursfor full brain performance, and many of them, on a school night,are only getting five hours of sleep."}, {"zh-tw": "這跟本不夠！讓我們在看看另一群人老人晚上的睡眠常會被打斷成好幾部份他們的睡眠同樣低於每晚 5 小時", "en": "It's simply not enough. If we think about other sectorsof society -- the aged; if you are aged, then your abilityto sleep in a single block is somewhat disrupted,and many sleep, again, less than five hours a night."}, {"zh-tw": "輪班的人大概佔工作人口的 20 %而生理時鐘不會依據夜班而調整", "en": "Shift work. Shift work is extraordinary, perhaps 20 percentof the working population, and the body clock does not shiftto the demands of working at night."}, {"zh-tw": "它依據相同的光暗循環所以當可憐的夜班工作者疲憊的回家休息時生理時鐘會說：「醒醒啊！現在是白天！」夜班工作者的睡眠品質通常很差他們一樣被分在睡 5 小時的這群", "en": "It's locked onto the samelight-dark cycle as the rest of us. So when the poor oldshift worker is going home to try and sleep during the day,desperately tired, the body clock is saying,\"Wake up. This is the time to be awake.\" So the quality of sleepthat you get as a night shift worker is usually very poor,again in that sort of five-hour region."}, {"zh-tw": "接著是，當然，有上百萬人受時差影響在座有誰是呢？我的天啊！", "en": "And then, of course, tens of millionsof people suffer from jet lag. So who here has jet lag? Well, my goodness gracious."}, {"zh-tw": "因為你們大腦正渴望睡眠我得感謝你們沒有睡著另一種大腦會進行或沈迷的是微睡眠這是非自願性的入睡你根本無法控制這種睡眠", "en": "Well, thank you very muchindeed for not falling asleep, because that's what your brain is craving. One of the things that the brain doesis indulge in micro-sleeps, this involuntary falling asleep, and you have essentiallyno control over it."}, {"zh-tw": "微睡眠令人尷尬但它們也可能致命大約有 31% 的駕駛至少有一次在駕駛中打瞌睡在美國，統計數據很完整10 萬件高速公路意外和疲勞、鬆懈及打瞌睡有關每年平均 1 萬件！不可思議！", "en": "Now, micro-sleeps can be sortof somewhat embarrassing, but they can also be deadly. It's been estimatedthat 31 percent of drivers will fall asleep at the wheelat least once in their life, and in the US, the statisticsare pretty good: 100,000 accidents on the freewayhave been associated with tiredness, loss of vigilance, and falling asleep --a hundred thousand a year."}, {"zh-tw": "在另一個層級的恐怖我們看到在車諾比事件和挑戰者號太空梭的意外都造成悲劇性的損失", "en": "It's extraordinary. At another level of terror, we dip into the tragicaccidents at Chernobyl and indeed the space shuttle Challenger, which was so tragically lost."}, {"zh-tw": "在事件調查中發現延長工作時數造成鬆懈與疲倦降低判斷力是導致悲劇的主因所以當你疲倦、缺乏睡眠時你的記憶力和創造力都很差你會變得更衝動而且判斷能力也會下降", "en": "And in the investigationsthat followed those disasters, poor judgment as a resultof extended shift work and loss of vigilance and tiredness was attributed to a big chunkof those disasters. When you're tired and you lack sleep, you have poor memory,you have poor creativity, you have increased impulsiveness, and you have overall poor judgment."}, {"zh-tw": "但是還有比這些更糟的事如果大腦疲憊就會需要刺激保持清醒", "en": "But my friends,it's so much worse than that. If you are a tired brain, the brain is craving things to wake it up."}, {"zh-tw": "西方社會的選擇以藥物、興奮劑和咖啡因為代表", "en": "So drugs, stimulants. Caffeine representsthe stimulant of choice across much of the Western world."}, {"zh-tw": "大部份時間可以咖啡提神如果大腦過勞則會選擇尼古丁如果在工作時使用興奮劑提神當然在晚上 11 點時大腦會認為自己不需要睡太多", "en": "Much of the day is fueled by caffeine, and if you're a really naughtytired brain, nicotine. Of course, you're fueling the waking statewith these stimulants, and then, of course, it getsto 11 o'clock at night, and the brain says to itself, \"Actually, I needto be asleep fairly shortly."}, {"zh-tw": "這時如果你真的想睡時你會依靠酒精偶爾或短時間內酒精可以讓你鎮定", "en": "What do we do about thatwhen I'm feeling completely wired?\" Well, of course,you then resort to alcohol. Now alcohol, short-term,you know, once or twice, to use to mildly sedate you,can be very useful."}, {"zh-tw": "它可以幫助入眠但是你必須注意的是酒精只能麻醉你", "en": "It can actually ease the sleep transition. But what you must be so aware ofis that alcohol doesn't provide sleep."}, {"zh-tw": "在生理上很像入眠，但卻不是事實上，它會損害某些神經活動過程包含記憶的強化或回想", "en": "A biological mimic for sleep, it sedates you. So it actually harmssome of the neural processing that's going on during memoryconsolidation and memory recall."}, {"zh-tw": "所以這是短期有效的方法但看在老天的份上別每晚依靠酒精入睡增重是另一個缺乏睡眠的後果", "en": "So it's a short-term acute measure, but for goodness sake, don't become addicted to alcohol as a way of getting to sleep every night. Another connectionbetween loss of sleep is weight gain."}, {"zh-tw": "如果每晚睡 5 小時或更少你會高出 50% 罹患肥胖症為什麼有此關連？睡眠缺乏時可能會提高飢餓素 (ghrelin) 的釋放", "en": "If you sleep aroundabout five hours or less every night, then you have a 50 percentlikelihood of being obese. What's the connection here? Well, sleep loss seems to give riseto the release of the hormone ghrelin, the hunger hormone."}, {"zh-tw": "當飢餓素到達腦部", "en": "Ghrelin is released. It gets to the brain."}, {"zh-tw": "大腦會說：「需要更多碳水化合物」在尋找碳水化合物的過程中主要是尋找糖類這就連接疲倦和代謝失衡所造成的增重", "en": "The brain says, \"I need carbohydrates,\" and what it does is seek out carbohydratesand particularly sugars. So there's a link between tiredness and the metabolic predispositionfor weight gain: stress."}, {"zh-tw": "疲倦的人承受著巨大的壓力其中一個壓力的後果就是喪失記憶這就是為什麼我剛剛跳過一小段", "en": "Tired people are massively stressed. And one of the things of stress,of course, is loss of memory, which is what I sort of just thenhad a little lapse of."}, {"zh-tw": "但壓力影響範圍更大如果你突然間感到壓力，這影響不大但長時間的壓力會造成缺乏睡眠和其他問題", "en": "But stress is so much more. So, if you're acutely stressed,not a great problem, but it's sustained stress associatedwith sleep loss that's the problem."}, {"zh-tw": "長期的壓力會抑制免疫系統所以疲倦的人更容易受到感染有些很好的研究顯示輪班工作者更容易得到癌症", "en": "Sustained stress leadsto suppressed immunity. And so, tired people tend to havehigher rates of overall infection, and there's some very good studies showing that shift workers, for example,have higher rates of cancer."}, {"zh-tw": "壓力會增加血流中的葡萄糖含量當葡萄糖成為血液的重要成份身體對葡萄糖耐受性也會上升", "en": "Increased levels of stressthrow glucose into the circulation.

So at this point in the talk,this is a nice time to think, \"Well, do you think on the wholeI'm getting enough sleep?\" So a quick show of hands."}, {"zh-tw": "有誰認為自己有睡飽？噢！這真令人印象深刻很好，我們接下來會談到入眠的訣竅", "en": "Who feels that they're gettingenough sleep here? Oh. Well, that's pretty impressive. Good. We'll talk more about that later,about what are your tips."}, {"zh-tw": "當然，大部份人會問我怎麼知道我睡夠了？嗯，這不是深奧的學問如果你需要鬧鐘較你起床如果你需要花長時間清醒如果你需要興奮劑如果你乖戾易怒如果你會被工作夥伴說你看起來疲憊且煩躁你很有可能睡眠不足", "en": "So most of us, of course,ask the question, \"How do I know whetherI'm getting enough sleep?\" Well, it's not rocket science. If you need an alarm clock to getyou out of bed in the morning, if you are taking a long time to get up, if you need lots of stimulants, if you're grumpy, if you're irritable, if you're told by your work colleaguesthat you're looking tired and irritable, chances are you are sleep-deprived."}, {"zh-tw": "聽聽別人，想想自己你該怎麼辦呢？嗯，這可能有點冒犯白癡睡覺法：", "en": "Listen to them.
