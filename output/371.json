So are you saying that we shouldthink of the universe, at its heart -- that the smallest things that there are, are somehow an E8 object of possibility? I mean, is there a scale to it,at the smallest scale, or ...? GL: Well, right nowthe pattern I showed you that corresponds to what we knowabout elementary particle physics -- that already correspondsto a very beautiful shape.", "zh-tw": "如果你是對的，那就把重力和量子理論結合了起來所以你是不是說我們應該瞭解在宇宙中那些最微小的事物有可能就是E8模型我是說 你心裏是不是有一個最小的尺寸還是嗯，剛剛給你們看得圖案規則就是我們所知的基本粒子物理而且它已經是一個很漂亮的圖案了"}, {"en": "And that's the onethat I said we knew for certain. And that shapehas remarkable similarities -- and the way it fits into this E8 pattern,which could be the rest of the picture.", "zh-tw": "那個就是我所說的我們很確信的地方而這個形狀和E8有著明顯的相似處在剩下的圖片中幾乎和E8合為一體"}, {"en": "And these patterns of pointsthat I've shown for you actually represent symmetriesof this high-dimensional object that would be warpingand moving and dancing over the space-time that we experience. And that would be what explains all theseelementary particles that we see.", "zh-tw": "我給你們看得這些點狀圖案實際上代表著更高維物體的對稱性這些圖案在我們生活的時空中蜷曲，移動和舞蹈這就解釋了所有的我們所看見的基本粒子"}, {"en": "CA: But a string theorist,as I understand it, explains electrons in termsof much smaller strings vibrating -- I know, you don't like string theory --vibrating inside it. How should we thinkof an electron in relation to E8? GL: Well, it would be oneof the symmetries of this E8 shape.", "zh-tw": "我們所看見的基本粒子弦理論家會在更小的弦震動裏解釋電子我知道你不喜歡弦理論但我們該怎樣理解在E8模型中的電子不 它將會是這個E8型狀對稱性的一部分"}, {"en": "So what's happening is, as the shapeis moving over space-time, it's twisting. And the direction it's twistingas it moves is what particle we see.", "zh-tw": "所以實際上 當這個形狀在時空中游走它會扭曲 而它扭曲的方向就是我們所看到的粒子 所以就是"}, {"en": "So it would be -- CA: The size of the E8 shape,how does that relate to the electron? I feel like I need that for my picture.Is it bigger? Is it smaller? GL: As far as we know,electrons are point particles, so this would be going downto the smallest possible scales. So the way these things are explainedin quantum field theory is, all possibilities are expandingand developing at once.", "zh-tw": "E8形狀的大小是怎麼樣和電子相聯繫的呢我自己有些想像不出來它會大些還是小些嗯　就我們所知電子是點粒子所以這個會讓我們看到最小的尺寸所以在量子場論中，這些東西的解釋方式是所有的可能性都在同時展開發展"}, {"en": "And this is whyI use the analogy to coral. And -- in this way, the way that E8 comes in is it will be as a shape that's attachedat each point in the space-time.", "zh-tw": "這也是我為什麼拿珊瑚作類比因為這樣，E8的進入方式是一個可以連接時空中每一點的形狀"}, {"en": "And, as I said,the way the shape twists -- the directional along which waythe shape is twisting as it moves over this curved surface -- is what the elementary particlesare, themselves. So through quantum field theory, they manifest themselves as pointsand interact that way.", "zh-tw": "還有　想我所說的　形狀在經過這個曲線的表面時它的扭曲的方式和其的扭曲方向是基本粒子它們自己在量子場理論中 粒子與粒子間和點與點間一樣，相互作用"}, {"en": "I don't know if I'll be ableto make this any clearer. CA: It doesn't really matter.", "zh-tw": "我不知道我能不能解釋得更加清楚了沒關係"}, {"en": "It's evoking a kind of sense of wonder, and I certainlywant to understand more of this. But thank you so much for coming.That was absolutely fascinating.", "zh-tw": "它已經激起了我們的興趣我確定我想瞭解的更多太感謝你的光臨了。你的演說太吸引人了"}], "title": "Garrett Lisi On His Theory Of Everything", "url": "http://www.ted.com/talks/garrett_lisi_on_his_theory_of_everything"}
