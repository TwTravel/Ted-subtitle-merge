So people looking for good jobsare going to fail."}, {"zh-tw": "我要談一談那些尋找偉大的工作，偉大的職業的之所以要找這樣的工作，還有為什麼你會失敗。第一個原因是，無論別人告訴你多少次\"如果您想要偉大的事業，你必須追求你的熱情，你要追尋自己的夢想，你要追求在你一生中最大的夢想\"你一再的聽到這樣的說法，然後你決定", "en": "I want to talk about thoselooking for great jobs, great careers, and why you're going to fail. First reason is that no matterhow many times people tell you, \"If you want a great career,you have to pursue your passion, you have to pursue your dreams,you have to pursue the greatest fascination in your life,\" you hear it again and again,and then you decide not to do it."}, {"zh-tw": "不做這樣的事。不管你下載了多少次史蒂芬-賈伯斯 的史丹福大學畢業典禮演講，您仍然會看著它，然後決定不去這樣做。我並不太確定為什麼你決定不去這樣做。", "en": "It doesn't matterhow many times you download Steven J.'s Stanford commencement address, you still look at itand decide not to do it.

Then, your other excuse is, \"Yes, there are special peoplewho pursue their passions, but they are geniuses."}, {"zh-tw": "他們是 史蒂夫-賈伯斯，我並不是天才。", "en": "They are Steven J. I'm not a genius."}, {"zh-tw": "當我五歲的時候，我以為我是個天才，但是我的指導教授已經把這樣的想法趕出我的腦袋了，從那次... \"對吧？\"如今我知道我只是稱職的員工。\"現在，你看，如果這是 1950 年，一個稱職的員工就可以算是帶給你一個偉大的事業。但你猜怎麼著？現在已經快 2012了，若你對外說:\"我是個完全稱職的員工\"就好像用這種微弱的讚美來咒罵你自己一般", "en": "When I was five, I thought I was a genius, but my professors have beaten that ideaout of my head long since.\" \"And now I knowI am completely competent.\" Now, you see, if this was 1950, being completely competent -- that would have given you a great career.

You're interesting.\" Won't happen. Won't happen, and you will die alone."}, {"zh-tw": "你想要什麼，你想要什麼，你想要什麼，就是熱情。它超越了興趣。", "en": "What you want, what you want, what you want, is passion. It is beyond interest."}, {"zh-tw": "您可以有 20 種興趣，然後是其中之一，其中之一可能會抓住你，其中之一可能會讓你投入超過其他的任何事情, 然後你才可能算是找到你最愛的，比較過之後，都超過了所有其他你感興趣的事情，這就是所謂的熱情。我有一個朋友，向他的愛人求婚。", "en": "You need 20 interests,and then one of them, one of them might grab you, one of them might engage youmore than anything else, and then you may have foundyour greatest love, in comparison to all the other thingsthat interest you, and that's what passion is.

Although, he did make a note to himselfthat the next time he proposed, it was perhaps not necessary to enumerate all of the womenhe had auditioned for the part."}, {"zh-tw": "但是這個論點是對的。你必須尋找替代方案這樣，你才能發現你的命運中注定的，或者你會害怕聽到 \"命運\" 這個詞嗎？\"命運\"這個詞會嚇到你嗎？", "en": "But the point stands. You must look for alternativesso that you find your destiny, or are you afraid of the word \"destiny\"? Does the word \"destiny\" scare you? That's what we're talking about."}, {"zh-tw": "這就是我們在談的，如果你找不到能展現你才華的最高境界的事情，而屈就於\"有興趣的\"，不管這個代表什麼意思你知道當你漫長一生結束時將發生什麼？您的朋友和家人將聚集在墓地在你墳墓旁會有一塊墓碑，在墓碑上面刻的會是這樣的:\"這裡埋的是發明魔鬼氈的工程師。\"但是這個墓碑上應該刻的內容如果在不同方式度過的一生，墓碑上應該科的是關於你的天分的最高發揮比方說是 \"這裡埋的是 諾貝爾物理獎得主，他建立了大統一場論並且展示了曲速飛行 (科幻影集中星際航行的方式) 的實際可能性。魔鬼氈，的確。一個會是偉大的事業。另一個則是失去了一個機會。", "en": "And if you don't findthe highest expression of your talent, if you settle for \"interesting,\"what the hell ever that means, do you know what will happenat the end of your long life?

One was a great career. One was a missed opportunity."}, {"zh-tw": "但是，你們之中的一些人儘管有各式各樣的藉口，你會發現，你會發現你的熱情，", "en": "But then, there are some of you who, in spite of all theseexcuses, you will find, you will find your passion. And you'll still fail."}, {"zh-tw": "而你仍會失敗。你會失敗，因為，因為你不會去做，因為你會發明新的藉口，任何可以不去做的藉口，而這種藉口我已經聽了很多次。\"是的，我原本想追求偉大的事業，但我認為人際關係比個人成就更有價值", "en": "You're going to fail, because -- because you're not going to do it, because you will haveinvented a new excuse, any excuse to fail to take action, and this excuse, I've heard so many times: \"Yes, I would pursue a great career, but, I value human relationships -- more than accomplishment.

What a wimp."}, {"zh-tw": "但你是什麼意思呢？這就是你希望我說的。你真的認為，你真的認為這樣做是適當的?你應該實際上把兒童當作擋箭牌嗎？你知道總有一天，會發生一些事你，你這個理想的父母，你呢？有一天小孩會來找你，說，\"我知道我想要變成什麼樣的人。", "en": "But what do you mean?That's what you expect me to say.
