They thought a C was all rightfor the neighbors' children, because they were all average."}, {"zh-tw": "當是他們自己的孩子時，他們不滿意會讓老師覺得失敗了或他們的年輕子弟失敗了這是不對的。在上帝無限的智慧裡", "en": "But they weren't satisfiedwhen their own -- it would make the teacher feel that theyhad failed, or the youngster had failed. And that's not right."}, {"zh-tw": "沒有創造我們在智性上是平等的大小、外表也是並不是每個人都可得到A或B，且我不喜歡用此來評斷人我不知道其他學校的校友在30年代如何評斷教練和運動隊伍", "en": "The good Lord in his infinitewisdom didn't create us all equal as far as intelligence is concerned, any more than we're equalfor size, appearance. Not everybody could earn an A or a B,and I didn't like that way of judging, and I did know howthe alumni of various schools back in the '30s judgedcoaches and athletic teams."}, {"zh-tw": "如果你贏過他們,你會被認為相當地成功並非完全如此。因為我發現--在UCLA,我們有好幾年,我們一場球都沒輸過 (UCLA-加州大學落山磯分校）", "en": "If you won them all, you were consideredto be reasonably successful -- not completely. Because I found out -- we had a number of years at UCLAwhere we didn't lose a game."}, {"zh-tw": "但似乎我們在每一場贏也沒有贏多少像我們的校友所預估的而且我常常--(笑聲）而且常常我真的感覺他們的預估是依據一種比較物質面的態度。但在30年代是這樣的, 所以我了解", "en": "But it seemed that we didn't wineach individual game by the margin that someof our alumni had predicted -- And quite frequently I really feltthat they had backed up their predictions in a more materialistic manner. But that was true backin the 30s, so I understood that."}, {"zh-tw": "但是我不喜歡。且我不同意我想要想出如何使我成為一個更好的教師且給在我指導下的年輕人--不管是運動上或在英文課裡 --一些可以嚮往的而不只是較高的成績在教室理,或在運動比賽裡有更多的得分", "en": "But I didn't like it,I didn't agree with it. I wanted to come up with somethingI hoped could make me a better teacher, and give the youngstersunder my supervision, be it in athleticsor the English classroom, something to which to aspire, other than just a highermark in the classroom, or more points in some athletic contest."}, {"zh-tw": "我費力的思考著,且我想要想出我自己的定義。我想那可能有幫助", "en": "I thought about that for quite a spell, and I wanted to comeup with my own definition. I thought that might help."}, {"zh-tw": "我知道韋伯先生如何定義它（韋伯字典）即物質擁有的累積或權力或聲望地位的獲得，或這類的東西或許是值得的成就但在我的意見裡未必表示成功所以我想要想出我自己的來", "en": "And I knew how Mr. Webster defined it, as the accumulationof material possessions or the attainment of a position of poweror prestige, or something of that sort, worthy accomplishments perhaps, but in my opinion, not necessarilyindicative of success. So I wanted to come upwith something of my own."}, {"zh-tw": "我回想、我在南印第安那州的一個小農莊成長我爸試著教我和我的兄弟你永遠不要試著比任何人好我確定在那個時候他沒有, 我沒有 -- 它沒有 --某處,我想是隱藏在我的心裡的幾年後出現", "en": "And I recalled -- I was raised on a small farmin Southern Indiana, and Dad tried to teach me and my brothers that you should never try to bebetter than someone else. I'm sure at the time he didthat, I didn't -- it didn't -- well, somewhere, I guessin the hidden recesses of the mind, it popped out years later."}, {"zh-tw": "永遠不要試著比任何人好永遠向別人學習，永遠不要停止試著成為你可以的最好 - 那是你可以控制的", "en": "Never try to be better than someone else, always learn from others. Never cease trying to bethe best you can be -- that's under your control."}, {"zh-tw": "如果你過於投注和陷入和關切在那些你無法控制的事情上。它會相反地影響那些你能控制的事情上我想起這個簡單的詩句說著,在神的腳凳前承認,一個可憐的靈魂跪著,且低著頭", "en": "If you get too engrossedand involved and concerned in regard to the thingsover which you have no control, it will adversely affect the thingsover which you have control. Then I ran acrossthis simple verse that said, \"At God's footstool to confess, a poor soul knelt, and bowed his head."}, {"zh-tw": "‘我失敗了!' 他哭喊著主說, \"你盡你的全力了。那是成功。\"因為那些事情, 可能還有其他的,我創造我自己對成功的定義那是：心靈平靜的達成只有透過你知道你全力以赴的自我滿意你能力所及的", "en": "'I failed!' he cried. The Master said, 'Thou didstthy best, that is success.'\" From those things, and one other perhaps, I coined my own definitionof success, which is: Peace of mind attained onlythrough self-satisfaction in knowing you made the effort to dothe best of which you're capable."}, {"zh-tw": "我相信那是真的。如果你努力達到你能力所及的最好。試了且改善了狀況你所面臨的,我認為那是成功且我不認為別人可以評斷。我認為它就像性格和名聲你的名聲是你被認為是什麼你的性格是你真正是什麼", "en": "I believe that's true. If you make the effort to dothe best of which you're capable, trying to improve the situationthat exists for you, I think that's success, and I don't think others can judge that; it's like character and reputation -- your reputationis what you're perceived to be; your character is what you really are."}, {"zh-tw": "而且我認為性格是比你被認為是什麼更重要的你希望這二個都是好的但他們不必要都是一樣的", "en": "And I think that characteris much more important than what you are perceived to be. You'd hope they'd both be good, but they won't necessarily be the same."}, {"zh-tw": "那是我想要試著讓年輕人理解到的想法和一些其他的事。我喜愛教書,", "en": "Well, that was my idea that I was goingto try to get across to the youngsters. I ran across other things."}, {"zh-tw": "之前的講演者已經有提過我享受詩歌,且我樂在其中,我喜愛它有一些事情幫了我, 我想比我會是的還要好。我知道我不是我應該成為的", "en": "I love to teach, and it wasmentioned by the previous speaker that I enjoy poetry,and I dabble in it a bit, and love it. There are some thingsthat helped me, I think, be better than I would have been."}, {"zh-tw": "不是我應該是的。但我認為我比我會是的還要好如果我沒有碰到某些特定的事情其一只是一個小詩句說,沒有寫下來的文字,沒有說出的請求,可以教我們的年輕人他們應該是什麼也不是書架上所有的書 --是教師他們自己本身.\"那造成了我有個印象。在1930年代", "en": "I know I'm not what I oughtto be, what I should be, but I think I'm betterthan I would have been if I hadn't run across certain things. One was just a little verse that said, \"No written word, no spoken plea can teach our youth what they should be; nor all the books on all the shelves -- it's what the teachers are themselves.\" That made an impressionon me in the 1930s."}, {"zh-tw": "且我多少試用在我的教學裡不管是在運動，或者是在英文課程裡我愛詩歌且總是對它有興趣", "en": "And I tried to use thatmore or less in my teaching, whether it be in sports, or whetherit be in the English classroom. I love poetry and always hadan interest in that somehow."}, {"zh-tw": "可能是因為爸曾經在晚上念給我們聽煤油燈 -- 我們沒有電在我們的農莊家裡且爸會念詩歌給我們。所以我總是喜歡詩歌", "en": "Maybe it's because Dadused to read to us at night, by coal oil lamp -- we didn't have electricityin our farm home. And Dad would read poetry to us.So I always liked it."}, {"zh-tw": "大約在相同時期,我接觸到這一個詩句,我接觸到另一個。有一個人問一位女教師她為什麼教學然後她說她想要想一想", "en": "And about the same timeI ran across this one verse, I ran across another one. Someone asked a lady teacherwhy she taught, and after some time, she saidshe wanted to think about that."}, {"zh-tw": "然後她說,他們問我為什麼我教學我回答, \"我要去那裡找到如此燦爛的同伴？“那裡坐了位政治家,強壯,公正的,智慧的另一位是丹尼韋伯斯特,很具說服力的人坐在他旁邊是一位醫生,他快速穩定的手愈合了骨頭.或者止住了血的流出", "en": "Then she came up and said, \"They ask me why I teach, and I reply, 'Where could I findsuch splendid company?' There sits a statesman,strong, unbiased, wise; another Daniel Webster, silver-tongued. A doctor sits beside him, whose quick,steady hand may mend a bone, or stem the life-blood's flow."}, {"zh-tw": "那是一位建築者。教堂高立的拱門是他建立的,在那裡的牧師會說神的話且引領一位步入歧途的靈魂接觸到約穌所有的聚集 - 教師,農夫,商人,勞動者他們工作和投入和建造和計劃一個偉大的明天", "en": "And there a builder; upward risethe arch of a church he builds, wherein that ministermay speak the word of God, and lead a stumbling soulto touch the Christ. And all about, a gathering of teachers, farmers, merchants, laborers -- those who work and vote and build and plan and pray into a great tomorrow."}, {"zh-tw": "且我可以說,我可能看不到教堂或聽到說得,或吃到他們手種的農作物但我還是可以。且我還是可以說我曾認識他,他那時是弱小的,或是強壯的或是膽敢的或驕傲的或是同性戀我曾認識他,他當時是一個男孩", "en": "And I may say, I may not see the church, or hear the word, or eatthe food their hands may grow, but yet again I may; And later I may say, I knew him once, and he was weak,or strong, or bold or proud or gay. I knew him once, but then he was a boy."}, {"zh-tw": "他們問我為什麼我要教書,我回答\"我要去那裡找到如此燦爛的同伴？“而且我相信教學的職業它是真的, 你有如此多的年輕人我得以想我在UCLA的年輕學子們30多位律師, 11位牙醫和醫師很多、很多的教師和其他的職業給了你很大的喜樂去看他們繼續", "en": "They ask me why I teach and I reply, 'Where could I find suchsplendid company?'\" And I believe the teaching profession -- it's true, you have so many youngsters, and I've got to thinkof my youngsters at UCLA -- 30-some attorneys,11 dentists and doctors, many, many teachers and other professions. And that gives youa great deal of pleasure, to see them go on."}, {"zh-tw": "我總試著讓年輕人感覺他們在那裡,第一是要受教育的籃球是第二位,因為它付了他們的學費他們是需要一點時間社交活動但你讓社交活動優先其他的二項那你就什麼都擁有不久的所以那是我試著讓他們理解的想法給那些在我指導下的年輕人", "en": "I always tried to make the youngsters feelthat they're there to get an education, number one; basketball was second,because it was paying their way, and they do need a little timefor social activities, but you let social activities takea little precedence over the other two, and you're not goingto have any very long. So that was the ideathat I tried to get across to the youngsters under my supervision."}, {"zh-tw": "我有三個規則,差不多,我實際上總是堅持著我來UCLA前已有的,且我決定它們是很重要的", "en": "I had three rules, pretty much, that I stuck withpractically all the time. I'd learned these prior to coming to UCLA,and I decided they were very important."}, {"zh-tw": "第一是 - 永遠不要遲到。永遠不要遲到。然後我會說一些事如果我們要去某些地方,我要選手們乾淨和整齊我曾要他們穿夾克和襯衫和領帶", "en": "One was \"Never be late.\" Later on I said certain things -- the players, if we were leavingfor somewhere, had to be neat and clean. There was a time when I made themwear jackets and shirts and ties."}, {"zh-tw": "我看到校長到學校穿牛仔褲和高領衣服, 所以我想我那樣的要求是不對的所以我讓他們 -- 只要乾淨和整齊我有一個最偉大的選手之一,你可能聽過他,", "en": "Then I saw our chancellor comingto school in denims and turtlenecks, and thought, it's not right for me to keepthis other [rule] so I let them just -- they had to be neat and clean. I had one of my greatest playersthat you probably heard of, Bill Walton."}, {"zh-tw": "比爾·華頓,他來趕上巴士,我們正要離開到某處打球且他不是乾淨和整齊的,所以我不讓他去", "en": "He came to catch the bus; we wereleaving for somewhere to play. And he wasn't clean and neat,so I wouldn't let him go."}, {"zh-tw": "他不能上巴士。他需要回家清一清以便去機場所以對那事我是一個很要求的人。我相信..", "en": "He couldn't get on the bus, he had to go home and get cleaned up to get to the airport. So I was a stickler for that.I believed in that."}, {"zh-tw": "我相信時間很重要我相信你應該要準時。但我感覺在實際上,例如,我們準時開始,我們準時結束", "en": "I believe in time; very important. I believe you should be on time,but I felt at practice, for example -- we start on time, we close on time."}, {"zh-tw": "年輕人不需要感覺我們要把他們留超過時間當我在教練指導和訓練談話時,我常告訴年輕的教練們--和在教練指導訓練課程,多多少少,他們是年輕的教練在獲得專業", "en": "The youngsters didn't have to feelthat we were going to keep them over. When I speak at coaching clinics,I often tell young coaches -- and at coaching clinics, more or less, they'll be the younger coachesgetting in the profession."}, {"zh-tw": "大部份都是年輕的,你知道的,可能才剛結婚我告訴他們,\"別練習時間晚了因為你可能會回家時心情不好那是不好的,一個年輕結婚的男人回家時心情不好。\"", "en": "Most of them are young, you know,and probably newly-married. And I tell them,\"Don't run practices late, because you'll go home in a bad mood, and that's not good, for a youngmarried man to go home in a bad mood."}, {"zh-tw": "當你老一些時,它是沒什麼不同的。但--所以我相信準時。我相信開始要準時,而且我相信結束要準時", "en": "When you get older, it doesn'tmake any difference, but --\" So I did believe: on time. I believe starting on time,and I believe closing on time."}, {"zh-tw": "另一個我有的是,一句褻瀆,不敬的話都沒有说一句褻瀆的話,你今天就結束了", "en": "And another one I had was,not one word of profanity. One word of profanity,and you are out of here for the day."}, {"zh-tw": "如果我在比賽裡看到,你就要出來坐冷板凳第三是, 永遠不要批評隊友", "en": "If I see it in a game, you're goingto come out and sit on the bench. And the third one was,never criticize a teammate."}, {"zh-tw": "我不要這樣。我曾告訴他們,我是被付薪水來做這件事的那是我的工作。我受薪做這件事。不是很好,但我是受薪做這件事", "en": "I didn't want that. I used to tellthem I was paid to do that. That's my job. I'm paid to do it.Pitifully poor, but I am paid to do it."}, {"zh-tw": "不像今日的教練們,有了更多的恩典,不是的在我那時代是有一些不一樣的", "en": "Not like the coaches today,for gracious sakes, no. It's a little differentthan it was in my day."}, {"zh-tw": "那是三件我總是很堅持的事情那些實際上是來自我爸爸的", "en": "Those were three things that I stuckwith pretty closely all the time. And those actually came from my dad."}, {"zh-tw": "那是他有一次試著教我和我的兄弟的我逐漸地發展出一個金字塔我沒時間來談這個", "en": "That's what he tried to teachme and my brothers at one time. I came up with a pyramid eventually, that I don't have the time to go on that."}, {"zh-tw": "但它幫了我,我想,讓我成為一個更好的教師就像這個的樣子在這個金字塔有一些格子基石是勤勉和熱情,努力工作和享受你在做的來到了頂端根據我對成功的定義", "en": "But that helped me, I think,become a better teacher. It's something like this: And I had blocks in the pyramid, and the cornerstones beingindustriousness and enthusiasm, working hard and enjoyingwhat you're doing, coming up to the apex, according to my definition of success."}, {"zh-tw": "就在最頂端 -- 信心和耐心我跟你說。不管你在做什麼你必須要有耐心。你必須要有耐心去 --", "en": "And right at the top, faith and patience. And I say to you,in whatever you're doing, you must be patient."}, {"zh-tw": "我們要事情發生。我們談論我們的年輕人常沒耐心", "en": "You have to have patience to --we want things to happen. We talk about our youthbeing impatient a lot, and they are."}, {"zh-tw": "而且他們是的。他們想要改變每一件事情他們認為所有的改變就是進步且我們變了老一些 -- 我們好像讓事情過去", "en": "They want to change everything.They think all change is progress. And we get a little older --we sort of let things go."}, {"zh-tw": "且我們忘記所有的進步都要有改變.所以你必須有耐心.且我相信我們必須有信心.", "en": "And we forget there isno progress without change. So you must have patience, and I believe that we must have faith."}, {"zh-tw": "我相信我們必須相信,真實地相信。不是只是嘴上說說;相信事情會像它們所應該的解決如果我們做我們應該做的", "en": "I believe that we mustbelieve, truly believe. Not just give it word service, believe that thingswill work out as they should, providing we do what we should."}, {"zh-tw": "我認為我們傾向事情應該如我們所要的結果發生,在大部份的時候。但我們不做需要做的讓那些事成為現實我如此做了14年,且我想它幫助我成為一個更好的教師", "en": "I think our tendency is to hope thingswill turn out the way we want them to much of the time, but we don't do the thingsthat are necessary to make those things become reality. I worked on this for some 14 years, and I think it helped mebecome a better teacher."}, {"zh-tw": "但它總是圍繞著一開始對成功的定義你知道在幾年前,有一個主要的聯盟棒球裁判員喬治.莫里亞帝(Moriarty)", "en": "But it all revolved around thatoriginal definition of success. You know, a number of years ago, there was a Major League Baseballumpire by the name of George Moriarty."}, {"zh-tw": "他拼他的名字只有一個“i”(同“眼睛”的發音）,我從沒看過, 但他的是", "en": "He spelled Moriarty with only one 'i'. I'd never seen that before, but he did."}, {"zh-tw": "大聯盟棒球選手 --他們對於這種事是很敏銳的他們覺察到在他的名字拼字上只有一個\"i\"(同“眼睛”的發音)你也會很訝異有多少人告訴他在他頭上有多一個（眼睛）在不同的時候", "en": "Big league baseball players -- they're very perceptiveabout those things, and they noticed he hadonly one 'i' in his name. You'd be surprised how many also told him that that was one morethan he had in his head at various times."}, {"zh-tw": "他寫了一些東西是我試著在這個金字塔做的。他叫它“前面的道路,或後面的道路”有時候我認為命運一定露齒笑著當我們指責他們且堅持我們不能贏的唯一理由是命運之神的失誤", "en": "But he wrote somethingwhere I think he did what I tried to do in this pyramid. He called it \"The RoadAhead, or the Road Behind.\" He said, \"Sometimes I think the Fatesmust grin as we denounce them and insist the only reason we can't win,is the Fates themselves have missed."}, {"zh-tw": "但古人的說法:我們輸贏都在我們自己裡面。在我們架子上的戰利品永遠也無法贏得明天的比賽", "en": "Yet there lives on the ancient claim: we win or lose within ourselves. The shining trophies on our shelvescan never win tomorrow's game."}, {"zh-tw": "你和我心裡深處都知道,總是有機會贏得皇冠但當我們未全力以赴,我們就是沒有通過這個測試,盡全力不保留的直到真正的贏了展現甚麼是咬緊地毅力繼續競賽穿越當別人已放棄了繼續競賽穿越,不放手", "en": "You and I know deeper down, there'salways a chance to win the crown. But when we fail to give our best, we simply haven't met the test,of giving all and saving none until the game is really won; of showing what is meant by grit; of playing through when others quit; of playing through, not letting up."}, {"zh-tw": "擊敗而贏了奬杯。夢想著前面的目標期望著當我們的夢想無效了祈禱著當我們的希望已消失輸了,不害怕跌倒,如果我們勇敢地付出全部。誰可以從一個人", "en": "It's bearing down that wins the cup.

It's you and I who make our fates -- we open up or close the gateson the road ahead or the road behind.\" Reminds me of another set of threesthat my dad tried to get across to us: Don't whine. Don't complain.Don't make excuses."}, {"zh-tw": "只要行動起來,且不論你在做什麼,盡你能力所能做到最好且沒人可做的比那樣還要多", "en": "Just get out there, and whatever you're doing,do it to the best of your ability. And no one can do more than that."}, {"zh-tw": "我也試著讓人理解 --我的對手不會告訴你 -- 你絕不會聽到我提到贏過別人永遠不要提贏過別人。我的想法是", "en": "I tried to get across, too, that -- my opponents will tell you --you never heard me mention winning.
