And as a sister and later, as a scientist, I wanted to understand,why is it that I can take my dreams, I can connect them to my reality, and I can make my dreams come true? What is it about my brother's brainand his schizophrenia that he cannot connect his dreamsto a common and shared reality, so they instead become delusion? So I dedicated my career to researchinto the severe mental illnesses."}, {"zh-tw": "印第安那州搬遷到了波士頓到哈佛大學精神醫學部， Francine Benes博士的研究室工作。我們研究的問題是所謂「正常人」的大腦和那些精神分裂患者精神混亂患者和躁鬱患者的大腦，在生理上到底有什麼不同？我們其實在繪出腦內的電路哪些細胞會跟哪些細胞溝通？用什麼化學物質來溝通？用多少化學物質來溝通？我白天都在做這種研究所以日子過的很充實到了晚上和週末我四處奔走替 NAMI (國家心理疾病聯盟) 作宣導", "en": "And I moved from my home stateof Indiana to Boston, where I was working in the labof Dr. Francine Benes, in the Harvard Department of Psychiatry. And in the lab,we were asking the question, \"What are the biological differences between the brains of individualswho would be diagnosed as normal control, as compared with the brains of individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia,schizoaffective or bipolar disorder?\" So we were essentiallymapping the microcircuitry of the brain: which cells are communicatingwith which cells, with which chemicals, and then in what quantitiesof those chemicals? So there was a lot of meaning in my life because I was performingthis type of research during the day, but then in the eveningsand on the weekends, I traveled as an advocate for NAMI,the National Alliance on Mental Illness."}, {"zh-tw": "但是在1996年10月10號，我醒來時發現自己的腦部出現了問題一根血管在我的左腦破裂", "en": "But on the morning of December 10, 1996, I woke up to discover that I hada brain disorder of my own.

You've got to pay attention.
