To explain the wish, I'm goingto have to take you somewhere where many people haven't been,and that's around the world. When I was about 24 years old, Kate Stohrand myself started an organization to get architects and designersinvolved in humanitarian work, not only about respondingto natural disasters, but involved in systemic issues."}, {"zh-tw": "我們相信在資源和專業知識匱乏的地方創新、可持續的設計才能夠真正地改善人們的生活因此，這一切都要從我的 -- 我最初是一名建築師，或培訓作為一個建築師我一直對社會認真負責的設計以及你們怎樣能夠真正產生影響感到興趣", "en": "We believe that where the resourcesand expertise are scarce, innovative, sustainable design can reallymake a difference in people's lives. So I started my life as an architect,or training as an architect, and I was always interestedin socially responsible design, and how you can really make an impact."}, {"zh-tw": "但當我在建築學校念書的時候我彷佛是當中的害群之馬許多建築師似乎認為，當你設計的時候你是在設計珠寶，而且是一個你嘗試和渴望擁有的珠寶然而我覺得，當你設計時對那個你設計的社區來說你不是在改進便是在破壞", "en": "But when I went to architecture school, it seemed that I wasa black sheep in the family. Many architects seemed to thinkthat when you design, you design a jewel, and it's a jewelthat you try and crave for; whereas I felt that when you design, you either improveor you create a detriment to the communityin which you're designing."}, {"zh-tw": "所以你並不是單單是為了那些居民建造房屋或是那些將會使用那些房屋的人們而是為了那整個社區在1999年，我們通過為在科索沃返回的難民解答房屋危機而開始", "en": "So you're not just doinga building for the residents or for the people who are going to use it,but for the community as a whole. And in 1999, we started by respondingto the issue of the housing crisis for returning refugees in Kosovo."}, {"zh-tw": "我那時候不知道我在做什麼，就像我說的，我那時20多歲正值網路的時代，所以我們開始了一個網站我們在網站上發起召喚，讓我吃驚的是在幾個月內，我們收到數百名來自世界各地參賽作品", "en": "And I didn't know what I was doing --like I said, mid-20s -- and I'm the Internet generation,so we started a website. We put a call out there,and to my surprise, in a couple of months, we had hundreds of entriesfrom around the world."}, {"zh-tw": "於是我們興建了一些建築範本以及把一些概念嘗試了兩年後，我們開始了一個應對在非洲撒哈拉以南數個，在愛滋病的流行而開發的流動診所項目", "en": "That led to a numberof prototypes being built and really experimenting with some ideas. Two years later we started doing a project on developing mobile health clinicsin sub-Saharan Africa, responding to the HIV/AIDS pandemic."}, {"zh-tw": "結果我們收到來自53個國家共550個參賽作品我們有來自世界各地的設計師參加這個項目", "en": "That led to 550 entries from 53 countries. We also have designersfrom around the world that participate."}, {"zh-tw": "而且我們也展覽了隨後的設計2004年是我們的轉捩點", "en": "And we had an exhibitof work that followed that. 2004 was the tipping point for us."}, {"zh-tw": "我們開始對自然災害產生應對也開始了在伊朗和巴姆的工作同時間我們在非洲的工作也持續進行在美國大部分人對貧窮感到陌生", "en": "We started responding to natural disasters and getting involved in Iran, in Bam, also following up on our work in Africa. Working within the United States -- most people look at povertyand they see the face of a foreigner."}, {"zh-tw": "但當你在 -- 我住在蒙大拿州波茲曼市--往北走到了北部平原上的保留帶或南下到阿拉巴馬州和密西西比州在卡崔娜颶風來襲前，你可以看到一些生活條件比發展中國家國家來得要差的地方因此，我們在內陸城市和其他地方開始參與和工作等一下我會介紹更多的項目", "en": "But I live in Bozeman, Montana -- go up to the north plainson the reservations, or go down to Alabamaor Mississippi, pre-Katrina, and I could have shown youplaces that have far worse conditions than many developing countriesthat I've been to. So we got involved in and workedin inner cities and elsewhere; and also, I will go intosome more projects."}, {"zh-tw": "然後是2005年的大自然災害我認為我們幾乎可以肯定2005年是令人恐懼的一年當涉及到自然災害的時候", "en": "2005: Mother Nature kicked our ass. I think we can pretty much assumethat 2005 was a horrific year when it comes to natural disasters."}, {"zh-tw": "而由於網際網路因為連接到部落格等等在發生海嘯幾個小時後，我們已經在籌集資金以及參與救災的工作在最初那幾天，我們靠著幾部筆記本電腦運作我收到四千多封需要幫助的電子郵件", "en": "And because of the Internet, and because of connectionsto blogs and so forth, within literally hours of the tsunami,we were already raising funds, getting involved, workingwith people on the ground. We run from a couple of laptops,and in the first couple of days, I had 4,000 emailsfrom people needing help."}, {"zh-tw": "所以我們開始參與那邊的方案我將談點別的當然，這一年我們在做和卡崔娜颶風相應的工作以及重建工程的後續工作", "en": "So we began to get involvedin projects there, and I'll talk about some others. And then of course, this yearwe've been responding to Katrina, as well as following upon our reconstruction work."}, {"zh-tw": "這是一個簡要的概述2004年，我真的無法應付那些大量需要幫助的人或是那些要求幫助的請求", "en": "So this is a brief overview. In 2004, I really couldn't managethe number of people who wanted to help, or the number of requeststhat I was getting."}, {"zh-tw": "那些請求全來到我的筆記電腦和手機裡因此，我們決定採用一個開放 --基本上是一個開源的商業模式即任何人，在世界任何地方，可以開始一個地方分會然後他們可以參與當地的問題", "en": "It was all cominginto my laptop and cell phone. So we decided to embracean open-source model of business -- so that anyone, anywhere in the world,could start a local chapter, and they can get involvedin local problems."}, {"zh-tw": "因為我不相信所謂的烏托邦所有問題都是地方性的，所有解決方案也都是地方性的", "en": "Because I believe thereis no such thing as Utopia. All problems are local.All solutions are local."}, {"zh-tw": "因此，這意味著住在密西西比州人比我更清楚了解密西西比州因此，我們用MeetUp和所有其他這類型的網路工具結果我們開了40個分會與及數千多名建築師分佈在104個國家", "en": "So that means, you know,somebody who's based in Mississippi knows more about Mississippi than I do. So what happened is, we used Meetupand all these other Internet tools, and we ended up having40 chapters starting up, thousands of architects in 104 countries."}, {"zh-tw": "所以，重點是 -- 不好意思，我從來沒有穿過西裝所以我知道我一定會除掉它因為我打算很快把它除掉", "en": "So the bullet point --sorry, I never do a suit, so I knew that I was goingto take this off. OK, because I'm going to do it very quick."}, {"zh-tw": "因此，在過去7年，這不僅僅是關於非營利而是它使我相信，有這樣的基層運動在進行有很多對社會負責的設計師他們相信這個世界可以團結一起我們有機會 -- 不是責任而是機會 -- 去參與改變這個世界", "en": "This isn't just about nonprofit. What it showed me is thatthere's a grassroots movement going on, of socially responsible designerswho really believe that this world has got a lot smaller,and that we have the opportunity -- not the responsibility,but the opportunity -- to really get involved in making change."}, {"zh-tw": "我會把這加在我的時間上所以你不知道的是我們有數以千計的設計師在世界各地工作他們僅靠著一個網站聯繫，而我們只有三個工作人員", "en": "I'm adding that to my time. So what you don't know is, we've got these thousands of designersworking around the world, connected basically by a website,and we have a staff of three."}, {"zh-tw": "通過做一些沒有人告訴我們不能做的事我們做到了。所以，天真或許不是壞的", "en": "The fact that nobody told uswe couldn't do it, we did it. And so there's somethingto be said about naïveté."}, {"zh-tw": "七年後，我們已經發展到有了提倡、煽動和實施，我們提倡好的設計不僅通過學生的研討會和講座，公眾論壇社論，我們有一本不僅是關於人道主義工作的書而且它還包括減輕災害和處理公共政策", "en": "So seven years later, we've developed so that we've got advocacy,instigation and implementation. We advocate for good design,not only through student workshops and lectures and public forums, op-eds; we have a book on humanitarian work; but also disaster mitigationand dealing with public policy."}, {"zh-tw": "我們可以談論聯邦緊急事務管理局，但那會是另一個演講煽動發展與各社區有關的構思和非政府組織做開源設計比賽", "en": "We can talk about FEMA,but that's another talk. Instigation, developing ideaswith communities and NGOs, doing open-source design competitions."}, {"zh-tw": "談到與社區配對然後實施 -- 切切實實地走出去工作因為當你發明時，直到它建成了，它才是現實", "en": "Referring, matchmaking with communities. And then implementing -- actuallygoing out there and doing the work, because when you invent,it's never a reality until it's built."}, {"zh-tw": "因此很重要的是，當我們在設計並試圖創建改變時，我們真真實實地建立這種改變這裡我選了一些項目", "en": "So it's really importantthat if we're designing and trying to create change,we build that change. So here's a select number of projects."}, {"zh-tw": "科索沃，我們在1999年的科索沃做了一個公開的設計比賽", "en": "Kosovo. This is Kosovo in '99."}, {"zh-tw": "就像我說的，這引發了各式各樣的構想", "en": "We did an open designcompetition, like I said. It led to a whole variety of ideas."}, {"zh-tw": "這重點不是緊急避難所而是可持續5到10年的過渡性房屋而且可放置於該地居民的住宅附近然後，他們將重建自己家園這不是把建築強加在社區上而是給他們的工具和空間讓他們重建他們想要的樣子", "en": "And this wasn't about emergency shelter, but transitional shelterthat would last five to 10 years, that would be placed next to the landthe resident lived in, and that they would rebuildtheir own home. This wasn't imposingan architecture on a community; this was giving themthe tools and the space to allow them to rebuild and regrowthe way they want to."}, {"zh-tw": "我們的設計有從宏偉到可笑的，但它們都行得通這是一個充氣大麻屋，它已建成並可使用", "en": "We had from the sublimeto the ridiculous, but they worked. This is an inflatable hemp house.It was built; it works."}, {"zh-tw": "這是一個運輸貨櫃，已建成和很實用", "en": "This is a shipping container. Built and works."}, {"zh-tw": "我們還有和很多不同的想法不僅涉及建築和設計還包括治理的問題和通過複雜的網絡來創建社區理念因此，我們不僅和設計師合作還和多種技術為基礎的專業人員合作", "en": "And a whole variety of ideas that not only dealt witharchitectural building, but also the issues of governance, and the idea of creating communitiesthrough complex networks. So we've engaged not just designers, but also a whole varietyof technology-based professionals."}, {"zh-tw": "使用被摧毀的房屋來建立新的家園使用稻草包來建設創造太陽能吸熱壁", "en": "Using rubble from destroyed homesto create new homes. Using straw bale construction,creating heat walls."}, {"zh-tw": "然後在1999年時，發生了一件值得注意的事我們去了非洲，原本只是去看看住屋的問題", "en": "And then something remarkablehappened in '99. We went to Africa originallyto look at the housing issue."}, {"zh-tw": "然而在三天內，我們意識到問題並不是在住屋而是在日益蔓延的愛滋病這並不是醫生告訴我們的而是和我們住在一起的村民告訴我們", "en": "Within three days, we realizedthe problem was not housing; it was the growing pandemic of HIV/AIDS. And it wasn't doctors telling us this; it was actual villagersthat we were staying with."}, {"zh-tw": "因此，我們想出了一個好主意與其讓人們步行10、15公里去看醫生，還不如把醫生帶到他們去便是這樣，我們開始參與的醫學界的工作那時候，我們認為我們是真的很聰明，就像火花一樣閃燿 --我們想出這一個偉大的構想，流動診所--一個可以廣泛分佈在非洲撒哈拉以南的流動診所那裡的社區和醫界對我們說「我們在過去的十年也是這樣想，我們早已知道這一點", "en": "And so we came up with the bright idea that instead of getting people to walk10, 15 kilometers to see doctors, you get the doctors to the people. And we started engagingthe medical community, and you know, we thoughtwe were real bright sparks -- \"We've come up with this great idea: mobile health clinics, widely distributedthroughout sub-Saharan Africa.\" And the medical community there said, \"We've said this for the last decade."}, {"zh-tw": "我們只是不知道怎樣實行。」在某種程度上，我們拿了一個早存在的需要，然後找出解決方案因此，我們再次找到各式各樣的概念", "en": "We know this. We just don't knowhow to show this.\" So in a way, we had taken pre-existingneeds and shown solutions. And so again, we had a whole varietyof ideas that came in."}, {"zh-tw": "這一個是我個人喜愛概念是建築不只是用來解決問題還包括提高人們的意識", "en": "This one I personally love, because the idea is that architectureis not just about solutions, but about raising awareness. This is a kenaf clinic."}, {"zh-tw": "這是一個紅麻診所。你拿一顆種子，然後把它種在土地一個月裡它便會生長14英尺在第四個星期，醫生會來了把草刈掉再把一個拉伸結構放在頂部當醫生完成治療和看完病人和村民後", "en": "You get seed and you grow itin a plot of land, and it grows 14 feet in a month. And on the fourth week, the doctorscome and they mow out an area, put a tensile structure on the top, and when the doctorshave finished treating and seeing patients and villagers, you cut down the clinic and you eat it."}, {"zh-tw": "你可以把診所砍下來吃，這是一個可以吃掉的診所我們面對的是，如果你有愛滋病你要明白你是需要營養以及明白營養的重要性是和得到抗病毒藥物是一樣重要的", "en": "It's an eat-your-own-clinic. So it's dealing with the factthat if you have AIDS, you also need to have nutrition rates, and the idea of nutrition is as important as getting antiretrovirals out there."}, {"zh-tw": "所以這是一個十分重要的解決方法", "en": "So you know, this is a serious solution. This one I love."}, {"zh-tw": "這個是我的喜愛，因為它不僅僅是一個診所，還是一個社區中心這個是關於建立貿易路線和經濟引擎在社區內這樣社區便可以自給自足", "en": "The idea is it's not just a clinic,it's a community center. This looked at setting up trade routes and economic engines within the community, so it can be a self-sustaining project."}, {"zh-tw": "每一個方案都是永續的我這樣做並不是因為狂熱環保份子", "en": "Every one of these projectsis sustainable. That's not becauseI'm a tree-hugging green person."}, {"zh-tw": "而是因為當你每天只可以花四元的時候你要生存便必須生活在永續中你要知道你的能量是從哪裡來你要知道你的資源是來自哪你必須保持把需要維修的減少", "en": "It's because when you liveon four dollars a day, you're living on survivaland you have to be sustainable. You have to know whereyour energy is coming from, you have to know whereyour resource is coming from, and you have to keep the maintenance down."}, {"zh-tw": "因此，這是有關獲取經濟的引擎然後靈活運用因此它不僅僅是一個愛滋病診所，它也是一個社區中心", "en": "So this is about gettingan economic engine, and then at night,it turns into a movie theater. So it's not an AIDS clinic.It's a community center."}, {"zh-tw": "你可以看到我們把不同的想法發展成範本", "en": "So you can see ideas. And these ideas developed into prototypes, and they were eventually built."}, {"zh-tw": "然後最終把它們建成， 今年目前我們已經有新建的診所在尼日利亞和肯亞我們之後還開發了西亞添巴，這個方案 --", "en": "And currently, as of this year, there are clinics rolling outin Nigeria and Kenya. From that, we also developed Siyathemba."}, {"zh-tw": "那社區來找我們，告訴我們他們的問題是女孩沒有受到教育那地方年齡介乎16至24歲的的女生有一半是患有愛滋病這並不是因為他們濫交而是因為他們沒有知識", "en": "The community came to us and said, \"The problem is that the girlsdon't have education.\" And we're working in an area where young womenbetween the ages of 16 and 24 have a 50 percent HIV/AIDS rate. And that's notbecause they're promiscuous, it's because there's no knowledge."}, {"zh-tw": "因此我們決定用運動的構思來建造一個青年體育中心而它同時作用愛滋病宣傳中心那裡當教練的女孩同一時間也是受過專門培訓的醫生我們用有一個很穩健的方式來建立當地的保健", "en": "And so we decided to lookat the idea of sports, and create a youth sports center that doubled as an HIV/AIDSoutreach center, and the coaches of the girls' teamwere also trained doctors. So that there would be a very slow wayof developing confidence in health care."}, {"zh-tw": "我們最後選了九個決賽者他們分佈在整個區域然後我們讓那社區挑選他們喜歡的設計他們說，這是屬於我們的設計因為它不單只致力於社區它還賦予這個社區力量讓他們成為重建進程的一部分", "en": "And we picked nine finalists, and then those nine finalists weredistributed throughout the entire region, and then the communitypicked their design. They said, this is our design, because it's not onlyabout engaging a community; it's about empowering a community, and about getting them to bea part of the rebuilding process."}, {"zh-tw": "這便是比賽的優勝作品我們也切切實實地和地區與客戶一起工作", "en": "So, the winning design is here. And then, of course,we actually go and work with the community and the clients."}, {"zh-tw": "你可以看到這個設計師與在西亞添巴誇祖魯納塔爾第一支女子足球隊一起工作", "en": "So this is the designer. He's out there workingwith the first ever women's soccer team in KwaZulu-Natal, Siyathemba."}, {"zh-tw": "他們可以告訴你更多我的名字是西西，我在非洲中心工作", "en": "And they can tell it better. (A cappella singingin a South African language) Video: Well, my name is Cee Cee Mkhonza."}, {"zh-tw": "我是這裡的顧問，也是南非曼德拉國家隊的足球運動員", "en": "I work at the Africa Centre,I'm an IT user consultant. I'm also the national football playerfor South Africa, Banyana Banyana."}, {"zh-tw": "我也是Vodacom聯盟一個叫比薩的隊伍的隊員現已改為叫西亞添巴這是我們的主場", "en": "And I also play in the Vodacom League,for the team called Tembisa, which has now changed to Siyathemba. This is our home ground."}, {"zh-tw": "我等一下再放給你們看，因為我的時間不多了我可以看到克里斯狡猾地看著我", "en": "Cameron Sinclair: I'm going to show thatlater because I'm running out of time. I can see Chris looking at me slyly."}, {"zh-tw": "這是一個聯系我和一個想要在坦桑尼亞開發非洲第一個遠程醫療中心的人面談我們可以說只在幾個月前見面而且，但我們已經發展了一個設計", "en": "This was a connection,just a meeting with somebody who wanted to develop Africa's firsttelemedicine center, in Tanzania. And we met, literally,a couple of months ago."}, {"zh-tw": "而且還有合作顆伴在那裡工作了", "en": "We've already developed a design. The team is over there,working in partnership."}, {"zh-tw": "通過兩個TEDster的介紹雪麗兒‧海勒和安德‧魯佐利我認識了一個十分優秀的非洲女士我們在六月開工建設，並將在TEDGlobal開幕", "en": "This was a matchmaking,thanks to a couple of TEDsters -- Sun [Microsystems],Cheryl Heller and Andrew Zolli, who connected mewith this amazing African woman. And we start construction in June,and it will be opened by TEDGlobal."}, {"zh-tw": "所以如果你會來TEDGlobal，你便可以來看看不過我們最知名的可能是處理災害和發展我們已經參與了很多不同的議題例如海嘯，以及卡崔娜颶風等等", "en": "So when you come to TEDGlobal,you can check it out. But what we're known probably most foris dealing with disasters and development, and we've been involvedin a lot of issues, such as the tsunamiand also things like Hurricane Katrina."}, {"zh-tw": "這是一個370美元，可以很容易地組裝的住屋這是一個社區的設計一個社區設計的社區中心", "en": "This is a 370-dollar shelterthat can be easily assembled. This is a community-designedcommunity center."}, {"zh-tw": "這意味著我們與那個社區一起生活和工作他們是設計過程的一環孩子們實際上參與了制訂地方社區中心的位置", "en": "And what that means is we actuallylive and work with the community, and they're part of the design process. The kids actually getinvolved in mapping out where the community center should be."}, {"zh-tw": "然後通過技能培訓最終與我們一起建造這社區中心這是另一所學校", "en": "And then eventually, the community,through skills training, end up building the building with us. Here is another school."}, {"zh-tw": "這是聯合國在六個月內給予這些他們 -- 12個塑料防雨布這是在八月時，這是用來替代的", "en": "This is what the UN gave these guysfor six months -- 12 plastic tarps. This was in August."}, {"zh-tw": "它屬意持續兩年當雨季來臨了，你什麼也聽不到而在夏季時，室內大約華氏140度", "en": "This was the replacement;that's supposed to last for two years. When the rain comes down,you can't hear a thing, and in the summer,it's about 140 degrees inside."}, {"zh-tw": "所以我們說，物盡其用吧！每所學校都有成本低廉的雨水收集系統", "en": "So we said, if the rain's comingdown, let's get fresh water. So every one of our schoolshas a rainwater collection system."}, {"zh-tw": "一堂課、三間教室和雨水收集共要5000美元我們在亞特蘭大靠著售賣熱巧克力籌得總數", "en": "Very low cost: three classroomsand rainwater collection is 5,000 dollars.

Here is a community that got together,and they said \"no\" to waiting."}, {"zh-tw": "他們建立了夥伴關係，一個多樣化的合作夥伴實際地制訂東比洛西克的規劃和找出參與的人我們有超過1500名志願者重建和整修家園", "en": "They formed a partnership,a diverse partnership of players, to actually map out East Biloxi, to figure out who's getting involved. We've had over 1,500 volunteersrebuilding, rehabbing homes."}, {"zh-tw": "以及弄清楚聯邦緊急事務管理局條例而不是等待他們支配我們應該如何重建與居民一起工作，讓他們走出自己的家園", "en": "Figuring out what FEMA regulations are, not waiting for them to dictateto us how you should rebuild.
