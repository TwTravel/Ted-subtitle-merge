There is no newspaper to cover her pain, and what she wants to change in this society."}, {"zh-tw": "我這麼做，也是為了一個年輕人他想要改變，卻無處發聲因為他不會寫字也沒有網路，沒有Facebook、Myspace或是YouTube等平台讓他們發聲", "en": "And I'm doing it for a young man who want to create a change and has no way to project his voice because he can't write. Or there is no Internet, like Facebook, MySpace, YouTube, for them to talk."}, {"zh-tw": "另一個無形鞭策我這麼努力地說故事四處分享這痛苦歷程的動力，就是我的夢想有時候就像是，我會聽到那些不幸喪命的人的聲音告訴我，「別放棄，堅持下去」因為我曾經幾度想放棄我不曉得這麼做會把自己推向什麼境地我出生時，正好是生活最艱困的時刻我的國家承受戰火摧殘", "en": "Also one thing that kept me pushing this story, this painful stories out, the dreams I have, sometimes, is like the voices of the dead, that I have seen would tell me, \"Don't give up. Keep on going.\" Because sometime I feel like stopping and not doing it, because I didn't know what I was putting myself into.

I didn't know what was the war for."}, {"zh-tw": "我只知道那些在我腦中、揮之不去的畫面當我到了童兵訓練營，我說我想要儘可能殺光所有的回教徒和阿拉伯人裡面的訓練很辛苦，但那是我支撐下去的動力因為我想替家人復仇", "en": "But one thing I knew was an image that I saw that stuck in my head. When I went to the training camp I say, \"I want to kill as many Muslims, and as many Arabs, as possible.\" The training wasn't easy, but that was the driving force, because I wanted to revenge for my family."}, {"zh-tw": "我想為村民復仇幸運地，現在一切有了轉機因為我發現了事實", "en": "I wanted to revenge for my village.

I've seen my people die like flies."}, {"zh-tw": "但我從沒見過任何一具屍體至少沒見過因我而死的屍體但每當我徘徊，仍不認輸", "en": "But I've never seen a dead body, at least one that I've killed. But still as I wonder, I won't go under."}, {"zh-tw": "四處都是槍林彈雨當時還年幼脆弱的我無法忘卻那個人說的話", "en": "Guns barking like lightning and thunder.

What energized me and kept me going is the music I do."}, {"zh-tw": "沒人能替我向大眾訴說我的故事找人來輔導我、安慰我所以音樂成了我療傷的藥方", "en": "I never saw anybody to tell my story to them so they could advise me or do therapy. So the music had been my therapy for me."}, {"zh-tw": "在音樂裡，我看見天堂在那裡，我能感受快樂我能找回童真，自在跳舞我知道世上只有音樂能有力量穿越你的肌膚你的意志、你的心靈影響你的靈魂並且在不知不覺中影響你的生活方式", "en": "It's been where I actually see heaven, where I can be happy, where I can be a child again, in dances, through music.

And I'm doing this because also it's a normal thing in my home, people eat one meal a day."}, {"zh-tw": "現在我到了西方國家，我仍選擇只吃一餐在我家鄉的孩子們會聽著BBC或其他廣播等著想知道何時Emmanuel會重新開始吃早餐因為，那就表示有錢蓋學校了", "en": "Here I am in the West. I choose not to.

I say, \"I'm gonna not eat my breakfast.\" I thought I was famous enough that I would raise the money within one month, but I've been humbled.
