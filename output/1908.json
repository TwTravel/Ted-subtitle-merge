And there I lived in a collapsing apartment buildingin Harlem with roommates."}, {"zh-tw": "這並不是比喻，有一天我們客廳的天花板真的塌下來了，每次新聞報導紐約的違章建築時，他們都會跑到我們的大樓下進行採訪。就好像讓你看看現場有多糟糕一樣。", "en": "I'm not using this phrasemetaphorically -- the ceiling actually collapsedone day in our living room. Whenever they did news storiesabout building violations in New York, they would put the reportin front of our building, as kind of, like, a backdropto show how bad things are."}, {"zh-tw": "言歸正傳，我白天上學，晚上我不停地一幅一幅地用鉛筆畫著畫。我學到了兩個令人驚訝的事情 --", "en": "Anyway, during the day, I went to school and at night I would sit and drawframe by frame of pencil animation. And I learned two surprising lessons."}, {"zh-tw": "其中一個是：當你想要喚起某些情感時，外觀並不算太重要，關鍵是動作 -- 物體運動的時機。關鍵是動作 -- 物體運動的時機。第二個是一位老師告訴我們的。", "en": "One of them was thatwhen you want to arouse emotions, it doesn't matter so muchhow something looks; it's all in the motion, in the timingof how the thing moves.

He was already dead! Just laying there, eyes glazed over!\" But, moving in a graceful wayis just one building block of this whole structurecalled human-robot interaction.

We didn't have to communicateverbally about this -- it all just happened."}, {"zh-tw": "於是我想，人類和機器人的互動卻完全不是這樣。當人類和機器人互動的時候，就好像他們在下棋。人類走一步，機器人對此分析一下，然後機器人決定接下來怎麼做，計劃好，走下一步。", "en": "And I thought, humans and robotsdon't look at all like this. When humans and robots interact,it's much more like a chess game: the human does a thing, the robotanalyzes whatever the human did, the robot decides what to do next,plans it and does it."}, {"zh-tw": "這時候人類就等著，直到再次輪到他們玩為止。所以，人類和機器人的互動更像下棋，這很好理解，因為對數學家和電腦科學家來說，它們都是關於資料分析、", "en": "Then the human waits,until it's their turn again. So it's much more like a chess game,and that makes sense, because chess is great for mathematiciansand computer scientists."}, {"zh-tw": "決策和計劃。但比起下棋，我更希望我的機器人是一個行動者，可以和人類有默契地一起工作。", "en": "It's all about information, analysis,decision-making and planning.

I took off from the PhD,I went to acting classes."}, {"zh-tw": "我還參與了一個戲劇，希望現在已經找不到那段影片了。我看遍每一本關於表演的書，其中包括一本從圖書館裡借來的19世紀的書。", "en": "I actually participated in a play -- I hope there’s no videoof that around still. And I got every bookI could find about acting, including one from the 19th centurythat I got from the library."}, {"zh-tw": "我震驚地發現我的名字是借閱者名單上的第二個，先前的一個名字是1889年。這本書已經躺了100年了，只為了藉機器人之名被重新發現。", "en": "And I was really amazed, because my namewas the second name on the list -- the previous name was in 1889. And this book waskind of waiting for 100 years to be rediscovered for robotics."}, {"zh-tw": "這本書教演員如何調動他們身體上的每塊肌肉來表達他們想要表達的情感。真正讓我受到啟示的是方法演技。", "en": "And this book shows actors how to move every muscle in the body to match every kind of emotionthat they want to express. But the real revelation waswhen I learned about method acting."}, {"zh-tw": "它在20世紀的時候非常流行。方法演技指出，你不需要安排你的每一塊肌肉，相反，你可以用你的身體找到對的動作。你應該運用你的感覺記憶，", "en": "It became very popularin the 20th century. And method acting said you don't have to planevery muscle in your body; instead, you have to use your bodyto find the right movement."}, {"zh-tw": "去重新建構情感，用你的身體找到對的表情。即興發揮，根據你的場景搭配。這個時候我也正讀到認知心理學中的體現認知，這也談到同樣的觀點 --", "en": "You have to use your sense memoryto reconstruct the emotions and kind of think with your bodyto find the right expression -- improvise, play off your scene partner. And this came at the same time as I was reading about this trendin cognitive psychology, called embodied cognition,which also talks about the same ideas."}, {"zh-tw": "我們用我們的身體思考，我們並不是用大腦思考，用身體表現，而是我們的身體反饋給大腦並做出相對應的動作，這對我好像一道靈光，", "en": "We use our bodies to think; we don't just think with our brainsand use our bodies to move, but our bodies feed back into our brain to generate the way that we behave. And it was like a lightning bolt."}, {"zh-tw": "我馬上回了我的辦公室。我寫了一篇論文，從來也沒發表過，叫做《人工智慧的表演課》。我甚至花了一個月的時間去做當時第一部由人類和機器人一起主演的戲劇。你之前看到的演員和機器人的表演就是這部戲劇。", "en": "I went back to my office, I wrote this paper,which I never really published, called \"Acting Lessonsfor Artificial Intelligence.\" And I even took another month to do what was then the first theater play with a human and a robot acting together. That's what you sawbefore with the actors."}, {"zh-tw": "當時我就想：我們怎樣可以做出一個人工智慧 --電腦、程式模型 --能夠即興發揮、會冒險、會投機甚至會犯錯。它可能會是更好的機器人隊友。因此我花了很多時間去研究這些模型，我試用在幾個機器人身上。", "en": "And I thought: How can we make an artificialintelligence model -- a computer, computational model -- that will model some of theseideas of improvisation, of taking risks, of taking chances, even of making mistakes? Maybe it can make for betterrobotic teammates. So I worked for quitea long time on these models and I implemented themon a number of robots."}, {"zh-tw": "這裡你可以看到一個早期的例子，這個機器人試圖運用體現人工智慧盡量地模仿我的動作，就好像遊戲一樣。", "en": "Here you can see a very early example with the robots trying to usethis embodied artificial intelligence to try to match my movementsas closely as possible. It's sort of like a game."}, {"zh-tw": "我們來看一下。你可以看到我可以糊弄它。", "en": "Let's look at it. You can see when I psychit out, it gets fooled."}, {"zh-tw": "有點像你看到的演員們互相模仿對方只為了找到他們之間的默契。然後，我又做了另外一個實驗，我從大街上拉人來使用這個機器人檯燈，試驗體現人工智慧。", "en": "And it's a little bitlike what you might see actors do when they try to mirror each other to find the right synchrony between them. And then, I did another experiment, and I got people off the streetto use the robotic desk lamp, and try out this ideaof embodied artificial intelligence."}, {"zh-tw": "其實，同樣的機器人我用了兩種大腦，機器人就是你看到的這個檯燈，我給了它兩種大腦。", "en": "So, I actually used two kindsof brains for the same robot. The robot is the same lamp that you saw, and I put two brains in it."}, {"zh-tw": "對一半的人，我放入了一個傳統的、機械計算的大腦。它會等待，會分析，會計劃，", "en": "For one half of the people, I put in a brainthat's kind of the traditional, calculated robotic brain. It waits for its turn,it analyzes everything, it plans."}, {"zh-tw": "我們暫且稱它為“會計算的大腦”。給另一半人則是那個舞台演員、愛冒險的大腦，", "en": "Let's call it the calculated brain. The other got more the stageactor, risk-taker brain."}, {"zh-tw": "我們暫且稱它為“愛冒險的大腦”，有的時候它在並不知道所有事情的情況下行動，", "en": "Let's call it the adventurous brain. It sometimes acts without knowingeverything it has to know."}, {"zh-tw": "有的時候它會犯錯然後去糾正。我讓他們完成一項無比乏味的任務，這個任務要花近20分鐘，他們必須一起合作完成，有點類似在工廠工作，機械地重複一件事情。", "en": "It sometimes makes mistakesand corrects them. And I had them do this very tedious taskthat took almost 20 minutes, and they had to work together, somehow simulating, like, a factory job of repetitively doing the same thing."}, {"zh-tw": "我發現人們非常喜歡那個“愛冒險的機器人”。他們覺得它非常聰明，更投入，是一個很好的團隊成員，一起幫助團隊成功。", "en": "What I found is that peopleactually loved the adventurous robot. They thought it was more intelligent, more committed,a better member of the team, contributed to the successof the team more."}, {"zh-tw": "他們甚至稱它為“他”和“她”，而另外那些人稱那個“會計算的機器人”為“它”，沒有人稱它為“他”或“她”。任務完成後，那些與“會冒險的大腦”互動的人說：“最後，我們成了好朋友，還在心靈上擊掌了。”不管那是啥意思聽上去很痛的樣子", "en": "They even called it \"he\" and \"she,\" whereas people with the calculated brain called it \"it,\" and nobodyever called it \"he\" or \"she.\" When they talked about it after the task,with the adventurous brain, they said, \"By the end, we were goodfriends and high-fived mentally.\" Whatever that means. Sounds painful."}, {"zh-tw": "然而，那些與“會計算的大腦”互動的人則說“它就像一個懶徒弟，只會做最基本的。 “這基本上和同人對機器人期待一樣，所以我有些驚訝，比起那些機器人專家，人們居然對機器人有更高的期望。", "en": "Whereas the peoplewith the calculated brain said it was just like a lazy apprentice. It only did what it was supposedto do and nothing more, which is almost what peopleexpect robots to do, so I was surprised that peoplehad higher expectations of robots than what anybody in roboticsthought robots should be doing."}, {"zh-tw": "但從另一個角度，我想該是時候了 --就像方法演技改變了19世紀人們思考表演的方式一樣，改變這種通過精確計算的行為方式，而轉向一種更直覺的、冒險的、 用身體表​​現的行為方式。也許應該是機器人革命的時刻了。幾年後，我在亞特蘭大的喬治理工大學做研究，我在一個研究機器人音樂家的小組工作。", "en": "And in a way, I thought,maybe it's time -- just like method actingchanged the way people thought about acting in the 19th century, from going from the very calculated,planned way of behaving, to a more intuitive, risk-taking,embodied way of behaving -- maybe it's time for robotsto have the same kind of revolution. A few years later, I was at my nextresearch job at Georgia Tech in Atlanta, and I was working in a groupdealing with robotic musicians."}, {"zh-tw": "我想，音樂是正好是研究團隊合作、協調、時機和即興表演的領域，我們有這個玩馬林巴的機器人。和我一樣對樂器不在行的朋友，馬林巴是一個巨大的木琴。", "en": "And I thought, music:that's the perfect place to look at teamwork, coordination,timing, improvisation -- and we just got this robotplaying marimba. And the marimba, for everybody like me, it was this huge, wooden xylophone."}, {"zh-tw": "當我看著這個，又看了那些人類和機器人的即興互動，沒錯，還有人和機器人的即興互動也都差不多像是一個下棋的互動。人類走一步，機器人對此分析，然後決定下一步。", "en": "And when I was looking at this, I looked at other worksin human-robot improvisation -- yes, there are other worksin human-robot improvisation -- and they were also a little bitlike a chess game. The human would play, the robot analyzed what was played, and would improvise their own part."}, {"zh-tw": "音樂家們稱其為呼叫和應答互動，這對機器人和人工智慧很合適。但是我想，如果我可以運用戲劇表演和團隊合作中的研究發現，也許我可以讓這些機器人組成一個樂隊，", "en": "So, this is what musicians calleda call-and-response interaction, and it also fits very wellrobots and artificial intelligence. But I thought, if I use the same ideasI used in the theater play and in the teamwork studies, maybe I can make the robotsjam together like a band."}, {"zh-tw": "每個人都在即興發揮，沒有人需要停下來。於是這次我嘗試用音樂做試驗，機器人並不知道它會演奏什麼，它就這樣移動它的身體，找機會演奏，做出我在17歲時爵士老師教我的事情。", "en": "Everybody's riffing off each other,nobody is stopping for a moment. And so I tried to do the samethings, this time with music, where the robot doesn't really knowwhat it's about to play, it just sort of moves its bodyand uses opportunities to play, and does what my jazz teacherwhen I was 17 taught me."}, {"zh-tw": "她說，當你在即興表演時，有時你並不知道你在做什麼，但是你還是繼續做。於是我嘗試做一個不知道自己在做什麼卻仍然繼續做的機器人。讓我們來看一下這個表演的一個小片段。", "en": "She said, when you improvise, sometimes you don't knowwhat you're doing, and you still do it. So I tried to make a robot that doesn'tactually know what it's doing, but is still doing it."}, {"zh-tw": "機器人聽音樂家演奏然後即興發揮。接著，看音樂家如何回應機器人的行為，接續機器人的演奏，有時甚至被機器人的表現驚訝。", "en": "So let's look at a few secondsfrom this performance, where the robot listensto the human musician and improvises. And then, look how the humanmusician also responds to what the robot is doing and picking up from its behavior, and at some point can even be surprisedby what the robot came up with."}, {"zh-tw": "（音樂）做一個音樂家不僅僅是演出音符，否則沒有人會去看現場表演了。音樂家也用他們的身體交流，和他們的樂隊成員，和觀眾，他們用他們的身體來表現音樂。", "en": "(Music) (Music ends) Being a musicianis not just about making notes, otherwise nobodywould ever go see a live show. Musicians also communicatewith their bodies, with other band members,with the audience, they use their bodiesto express the music."}, {"zh-tw": "於是我想，我們已經有一個在舞台上的機器人音樂家，為什麼不把它打造成一個真正的音樂家呢？於是我開始為機器人設計一個可以表現情感的頭部。頭部並不會碰到馬林巴，它只是用來表現音樂是什麼樣的。", "en": "And I thought, we already havea robot musician on stage, why not make it bea full-fledged musician? And I started designinga socially expressive head for the robot. The head doesn’t actuallytouch the marimba, it just expresses what the music is like."}, {"zh-tw": "這草圖的紙巾來自亞特蘭大某處一個酒吧，很可怕的是，酒吧就正好位落在實驗室和我家的正中間。所以我大概平均每天有3到4個小時的時間在那裡，", "en": "These are some napkin sketchesfrom a bar in Atlanta that was dangerouslylocated exactly halfway between my lab and my home. So I spent, I would say, on average,three to four hours a day there."}, {"zh-tw": "我覺得我重新拾起了我的動畫工具，試圖想像不僅僅一個機器人音樂家的樣子，而是一個機器人音樂家會如何移動它的身體，來告訴人們它不喜歡其他人的演奏，還有它自己當下感覺到的節奏。還有它自己當下感覺到的節奏。", "en": "I think. And I went back to my animationtools and tried to figure out not just what a roboticmusician would look like, but especially what a roboticmusician would move like, to sort of show that it doesn't likewhat the other person is playing -- and maybe show whatever beatit's feeling at the moment."}, {"zh-tw": "幸運的是，我們還獲得了一筆打造機器人的資金。接下來我給大家看一下同樣的表演換成一個有情感表現的頭。", "en": "So we ended up actually getting the moneyto build this robot, which was nice. I'm going to show you nowthe same kind of performance, this time with a socially expressive head."}, {"zh-tw": "請注意一點：這個機器人如何它從人類的節奏顯示出律動我們也讓人感覺到這個機器人知道它在做什麼。還有當它的獨奏開始時，它是如何做出回應的。", "en": "And notice one thing -- how the robot is really showing us the beat it's picking up from the human, while also giving the human a sensethat the robot knows what it's doing. And also how it changes the way it moves as soon as it starts its own solo."}, {"zh-tw": "（音樂）它正看著我確保我有在聽。（音樂）我們看一下這段的最後一個和絃，", "en": "(Music) Now it's looking at me,showing that it's listening. (Music) Now look at the final chordof the piece again."}, {"zh-tw": "當機器人正忙於做它自己的事情時它用它的身體進行溝通當準備好的時候它跟我一起演奏最後的旋律。（音樂）", "en": "And this time the robotcommunicates with its body when it's busy doing its own thing, and when it's ready to coordinatethe final chord with me. (Music) (Music ending) (Final chord) Thanks."}, {"zh-tw": "謝謝。我希望你能看到它的頭部雖然不碰到樂器其實有助於音樂表演既然我們在亞特蘭大，就不會說沒有饒舌歌手參與我們的實驗。這個饒舌歌手來了之後，我們讓他和這個機器人一起表演。", "en": "I hope you see how much this part of the bodythat doesn't touch the instrument actually helpswith the musical performance. And at some point -- we are in Atlanta, so obviously some rapperwill come into our lab at some point -- and we had this rapper come in and doa little jam with the robot."}, {"zh-tw": "這裡你可以看到這個機器人對節奏的回應，請注意兩點。第一，當這個機器人在搖頭晃腦的時候，你是不是也很想加入其中，", "en": "Here you can see the robotbasically responding to the beat. Notice two things: one, how irresistible it is to jointhe robot while it's moving its head."}, {"zh-tw": "和它一起晃動你的頭部第二，雖然這個饒舌歌手非常專注於它的 iPhone，當機器人轉向它的時候，他也馬上轉回來。", "en": "You kind of want to moveyour own head when it does it. And second, even though the rapperis really focused on his iPhone, as soon as the robot turnsto him, he turns back."}, {"zh-tw": "雖然僅僅是在他的視線邊緣他的眼角的餘光裡，仍然非常有影響力。這是因為我們無法忽視我們周邊物體的移動。", "en": "So even though it's justin the periphery of his vision, in the corner of his eye,it's very powerful. And the reason is that we can't ignore physical things moving in our environment."}, {"zh-tw": "我們天生會這樣做。所以，如果你不喜歡你的另一半太過專注於他的 iPhone 或智慧手機，也許你需要一個機器人來獲得他們的注意力。", "en": "We are wired for that. So if you have a problem -- maybe your partner is lookingat their iPhone or smartphone too much -- you might want to have a robotthere to get their attention."}, {"zh-tw": "（音樂）最後再為大家介紹一下我們最近在打造的一個機器人。說來也奇怪，我們發現到了某個階段，人們不再對那些聰明的、會即興表演、會聆聽、會做那些我花了多年研究的身體智慧表演的機器人感興趣了。他們真的很喜歡那個會享受音樂的機器人。", "en": "(Music) (Music ends) Just to introduce the last robotthat we've worked on, it came out of somethingsurprising that we found: Some point people didn't careabout the robot being intelligent, able to improvise and listen, and do all these embodied intelligencethings that I spent years developing. They really liked that the robotwas enjoying the music."}, {"zh-tw": "他們沒有說這個機器人是隨著音樂扭動身體，而是說這個機器人在享受音樂。於是我們想，為什麼不借用這個想法呢，因此我設計了一件新的小家具。", "en": "And they didn't say the robotwas moving to the music, they said \"enjoying\" the music. And we thought,why don't we take this idea, and I designed a new piece of furniture."}, {"zh-tw": "這次不是一個檯燈，而是一個揚聲器底座，就是你可以把你的智慧手機放上去的那種。於是我想，如果這個揚聲器底座不僅可以為你放音樂，還可以享受音樂，會怎樣？這是一些早期的的動畫嘗試。（笑聲)", "en": "This time it wasn't a desk lamp,it was a speaker dock, one of those thingsyou plug your smartphone in. And I thought, what would happen if your speaker dockdidn't just play the music for you, but would actually enjoy it, too? And so again, here are someanimation tests from an early stage."}, {"zh-tw": "這是最終的成品的樣子。（饒舌音樂 \"Drop It Like It's Hot\"）不停的點頭", "en": "And this is what the finalproduct looked like. (Music) (Music ends) So, a lot of bobbing heads."}, {"zh-tw": "有很多觀眾也在不停點頭，因此我們可以看到機器人可以影響人。當然這一切不僅僅只是娛樂和遊戲。", "en": "A lot of bobbing heads in the audience, so we can still seerobots influence people. And it's not just fun and games."}, {"zh-tw": "我覺得自己非常熱衷研究那些可以用身體溝通、用身體移動的機器人，原因是 --我告訴你一個只有我們機器人專家才知道的秘密 --我們每一個人都會在生命的某個階段需要機器人，你未來的某個階段會有個機器人。", "en": "I think one of the reasons I care so much about robots that usetheir body to communicate and use their body to move is -- I'm going to let you in on a littlesecret we roboticists are hiding -- is that every one of youis going to be living with a robot at some point in your life. Somewhere in your future,there will be a robot in your life."}, {"zh-tw": "如果不是你的未來，那就是你孩子的未來。我希望這些機器人比現在可以更流暢、更吸引人、更優雅。比現在可以更流暢、更吸引人、更優雅。", "en": "If not in yours, your children's lives. And I want these robots to be more fluent,more engaging, more graceful than currently they seem to be."}, {"zh-tw": "因此，我覺得機器人不應該是像一個下棋玩家，而應該更像一個舞台演員或者音樂家。它們應該可以冒險，會即興表演，", "en": "And for that I think maybe robotsneed to be less like chess players and more like stage actorsand more like musicians. Maybe they should be ableto take chances and improvise."}, {"zh-tw": "甚至會預料到你接下來會做什麼。它們也應該可以犯錯並且改正，因為到頭來，我們只是人類。", "en": "Maybe they should be ableto anticipate what you're about to do.
