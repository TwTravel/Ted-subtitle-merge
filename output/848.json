Or better, how do you explain when others are able to achieve thingsthat seem to defy all of the assumptions? For example: Why is Apple so innovative? Year after year, after year, they're more innovativethan all their competition. And yet, they're just a computer company."}, {"zh-tw": "就像其他電腦公司一樣他們對有同樣才華的人有相同的管道接觸同樣的廣告商、同樣的顧問、同樣的媒體", "en": "They're just like everyone else. They have the same accessto the same talent, the same agencies, the same consultants, the same media."}, {"zh-tw": "那麼為什麼他們似乎有點與眾不同？為什麼是馬汀路德金恩領導黑人民權運動？他不是唯一一個在美國受到平等公民權不公平待遇的人而且他絕不是當時最偉大的演說家為什麼是他？而為什麼是華特兄弟能夠想到控制力量，操控飛機當正有其他團隊更有資格、更有資本然而他們並沒有完成飛機反而是華特兄弟打敗他們完成了這件事。", "en": "Then why is it that they seemto have something different? Why is it that Martin Luther Kingled the Civil Rights Movement? He wasn't the only manwho suffered in pre-civil rights America, and he certainly wasn'tthe only great orator of the day. Why him? And why is it that the Wright brothers were able to figure out controlled,powered man flight when there were certainly other teams who were better qualified,better funded -- and they didn't achievepowered man flight, and the Wright brothers beat them to it."}, {"zh-tw": "這似乎有其他的因素在其中大約三年半前我有一個發現", "en": "There's something else at play here. About three and a half years ago,I made a discovery."}, {"zh-tw": "而這個發現深深地改變我對世界運作方式的看法而它甚至深深改變我生活的方式因為它變成—有個模式", "en": "And this discovery profoundly changedmy view on how I thought the world worked, and it even profoundly changed the wayin which I operate in it. As it turns out, there's a pattern."}, {"zh-tw": "而它引證了，所有偉大且具有啟發性的領袖以及世界上的機構不管是蘋果電腦，或馬汀路德金恩或華特兄弟他們都以同樣的方式思考、行動與溝通而這也完全與其他人相反", "en": "As it turns out, all the great inspiringleaders and organizations in the world, whether it's Apple or Martin Luther Kingor the Wright brothers, they all think, act and communicatethe exact same way. And it's the complete oppositeto everyone else."}, {"zh-tw": "我做的事就是解讀它而它或許是世界上最簡單的想法我稱它做黃金圈", "en": "All I did was codify it, and it's probablythe world's simplest idea. I call it the golden circle."}, {"zh-tw": "為什麼？怎麼做？做什麼？這個小小的想法解釋了為什麼有些機構和有些領袖能夠激勵群眾而別人做不到讓我很快地定義這些詞", "en": "Why? How? What? This little idea explains why some organizations and some leadersare able to inspire where others aren't. Let me define the terms really quickly."}, {"zh-tw": "在這個星球上的每個人，每個機構都知道他們在做什麼　－百分之百肯定有些知道如何做事這裡可以叫做是你不同的價值主張或者你的屬性過程或你的USP (賣點)", "en": "Every single person, every singleorganization on the planet knows what they do, 100 percent.

And by \"why\" I don't mean\"to make a profit.\" That's a result. It's always a result."}, {"zh-tw": "〞為什麼〞指的是：你的目的是什麼？你的出發點是什麼？你的信念是什麼？為什麼你的機構存在？為什麼你早上要起床？而且為什麼其他人要在乎？好的，結果是我們所想、所為以及我們所溝通的方式都是由外而內的很明顯。我們從最清楚到最模糊不明", "en": "By \"why,\" I mean: What's your purpose? What's your cause? What's your belief? Why does your organization exist? Why do you get out of bed in the morning? And why should anyone care? As a result, the way we think, we act, the way we communicateis from the outside in, it's obvious. We go from the clearest thingto the fuzziest thing."}, {"zh-tw": "但激勵人的領導者以及激勵人們的機構不管它們的規模，不管它們的產業都以由內而外的方式去思考、行動與溝通讓我給你們舉個例子", "en": "But the inspired leadersand the inspired organizations -- regardless of their size,regardless of their industry -- all think, act and communicatefrom the inside out.

But it's uninspiring."}, {"zh-tw": "這裡有蘋果電腦實際上溝通的方式：我們所做的每件事我們相信都在挑戰現狀", "en": "Here's how Apple actually communicates. \"Everything we do,we believe in challenging the status quo."}, {"zh-tw": "我們相信用不同的角度思考我們挑戰現狀的方式是使我們的產品有美好的設計容易使用而且迎合使用者。", "en": "We believe in thinking differently. The way we challenge the status quo is by making our productsbeautifully designed, simple to use and user friendly."}, {"zh-tw": "我們只是恰巧做了很棒的電腦。想要買一台嗎？完全不一樣，對吧？你準備要從我這裡買一台電腦了。", "en": "We just happen to make great computers.

You're ready to buy a computer from me."}, {"zh-tw": "我只要改變資訊的順序這個例子告訴我們人們不會買你做了什麼人們要買你為什麼做它人們不會買你做什麼；他們要買你的為什麼。", "en": "I just reversedthe order of the information. What it proves to us isthat people don't buy what you do; people buy why you do it."}, {"zh-tw": "這解釋了為什麼在場的每個人都對買蘋果電腦感到很好但我們也同樣感覺很好當購買蘋果電腦 的MP3播放器，或蘋果電腦的手機或蘋果電腦的DVR", "en": "This explains whyevery single person in this room is perfectly comfortable buyinga computer from Apple. But we're also perfectly comfortable buying an MP3 player from Apple,or a phone from Apple, or a DVR from Apple."}, {"zh-tw": "但如同我前述所說，蘋果電腦只是一家電腦公司結構上沒有什麼使它們與其他的競爭者不同", "en": "As I said before,Apple's just a computer company. Nothing distinguishes them structurallyfrom any of their competitors."}, {"zh-tw": "他們的競爭者都有同樣能力做這些產品事實上，他們試過", "en": "Their competitors are equally qualifiedto make all of these products.

It's all groundedin the tenets of biology."}, {"zh-tw": "不是心理學，是生物學如果你去看人腦裡的切面，從上往下看你看到的人腦實際上是分成三個主要部份的這和黃金圈完美地相關", "en": "Not psychology, biology. If you look at a cross-sectionof the human brain, from the top down,the human brain is actually broken into three major components that correlate perfectlywith the golden circle."}, {"zh-tw": "我們最新的腦，或說我們人類的腦我們的大腦皮層對應的是〞什麼〞的層次大腦皮層負責我們所有的理性、分析的想法以及語言", "en": "Our newest brain, our Homo sapien brain, our neocortex, corresponds with the \"what\" level. The neocortex is responsible for all of our rationaland analytical thought and language."}, {"zh-tw": "中間兩個部份組成我們腦的邊緣而我們邊緣的腦是負責所有的感情如信任與忠誠它也同時負責所有人類的行為所有的決策而它沒有語言的空間", "en": "The middle two sections make upour limbic brains, and our limbic brains are responsiblefor all of our feelings, like trust and loyalty. It's also responsiblefor all human behavior, all decision-making, and it has no capacity for language."}, {"zh-tw": "換句話說，當我們從外而內地溝通時是的，人們可以了解很多複雜的資訊量像是特色、好處、事實與數字但這不能刺激行為", "en": "In other words, when we communicatefrom the outside in, yes, people can understand vastamounts of complicated information like features and benefitsand facts and figures. It just doesn't drive behavior."}, {"zh-tw": "當我們能由內而外溝通時我們就正對著我們的腦說話那控制行為的腦然後我們允許人們去分析它以我們可以說與做的可見事物這就是我們用膽識做決定的來源", "en": "When we can communicatefrom the inside out, we're talking directlyto the part of the brain that controls behavior, and then we allow people to rationalize itwith the tangible things we say and do. This is where gut decisions come from."}, {"zh-tw": "你們知道，有時候你們可以給人們所有的事實與數字然後他們說，〞我知道事實與細節是什麼，但就是感覺不對勁〞為什麼我們會用這個動詞，〝感覺〞不對勁？因為管控決策的腦並不管控語言而我們最多能整理出的是〝我不知道，就是覺得不對〞或者有時你說你隨心所欲或者你跟隨你靈魂的聲音", "en": "Sometimes you can give somebodyall the facts and figures, and they say, \"I knowwhat all the facts and details say, but it just doesn't feel right.\" Why would we use that verb,it doesn't \"feel\" right? Because the part of the brainthat controls decision-making doesn't control language. The best we can muster up is, \"I don't know. It just doesn't feel right.\" Or sometimes you say you're leadingwith your heart or soul."}, {"zh-tw": "嗯，我很不想對你說，那些都不是身體的其他部份在控制你的行為所有的發生都在你邊緣的腦裡是控制決策而不是語言的腦", "en": "I hate to break it to you,those aren't other body parts controlling your behavior. It's all happening herein your limbic brain, the part of the brain that controlsdecision-making and not language."}, {"zh-tw": "但如果你不知道為什麼做你正在做的事而人們對為什麼你正在做的事有反應然後甚至是你如何贏得人們的選票或買你的東西或更重要的，忠實而且想成為你正在做的事的一份子再一次，目標不是僅僅將需要你所有賣給需要的人而已目標是要賣東西給那些相信你所相信的事的人", "en": "But if you don't knowwhy you do what you do, and people respondto why you do what you do, then how will you ever get people to vote for you,or buy something from you, or, more importantly, be loyal and want to be a partof what it is that you do. The goal is not just to sellto people who need what you have; the goal is to sell to peoplewho believe what you believe."}, {"zh-tw": "目標不是只在雇那些需要工作的人而是要雇用那些相信你所相信的事的人我會一直這麼說，你知道。如果你雇用人僅是因為他們能做事，他們將會為了你的錢而做事但如果你雇用那些相信你所相信的人們他們將與你工作：用血汗與淚水。", "en": "The goal is not justto hire people who need a job; it's to hire peoplewho believe what you believe.

Everybody was trying it."}, {"zh-tw": "而Samuel Pierpont Langley曾經擁有，我們假設的成功的關鍵我的意思是，即使現在，你去問人們〝為什麼你的產品為或什麼你的公司失敗？〞而人們總會給你相類似的三個原因資金不足，不適合的人，市場情況不良", "en": "And Samuel Pierpont Langleyhad, what we assume, to be the recipe for success. Even now, you ask people, \"Why did your productor why did your company fail?\" and people always giveyou the same permutation of the same three things: under-capitalized, the wrong people,bad market conditions."}, {"zh-tw": "總是這相同的三個原因，所以我們來研究一下Samuel Pierpont Langley從國防部得到5萬美金去研發這個飛行機器", "en": "It's always the same three things,so let's explore that. Samuel Pierpont Langley was given 50,000 dollarsby the War Department to figure out this flying machine."}, {"zh-tw": "資金不是問題他有哈佛大學的學位在Smithsonian工作而且有很好的人脈他認識當時所有著名的知識份子", "en": "Money was no problem. He held a seat at Harvard and worked at the Smithsonianand was extremely well-connected; he knew all the big minds of the day."}, {"zh-tw": "他雇用最好的人才資金有管道而市場情況呈現一片榮景紐約時報跟著他到處跑而且每個人都為Langley加油", "en": "He hired the best minds money could find and the market conditions were fantastic. The New York Timesfollowed him around everywhere, and everyone was rooting for Langley."}, {"zh-tw": "那麼你怎麼會從沒聽過Samuel Pierpont Langley？幾百英哩遠在俄亥俄州的Dayton萊特兄弟他們沒有我們認為的成功關鍵他們沒有資金他們用他們腳踏車店裡的現金來支付他們的夢想沒有任何一個在萊特兄弟的團隊裡的人有大學學歷兄弟倆都沒有而他們也沒有紐約時報的報導", "en": "Then how come we've never heardof Samuel Pierpont Langley? A few hundred miles away in Dayton Ohio, Orville and Wilbur Wright, they had none of what we considerto be the recipe for success. They had no money; they paid for their dreamwith the proceeds from their bicycle shop; not a single personon the Wright brothers' team had a college education, not even Orville or Wilbur; and The New York Timesfollowed them around nowhere."}, {"zh-tw": "不同的是萊特兄弟是有個目的去驅動他們的因為目的、因為相信他們相信如果他們能想出這架飛行機器這將改變世界的軌道", "en": "The difference was, Orville and Wilbur were driven by a cause,by a purpose, by a belief. They believed that if they couldfigure out this flying machine, it'll change the course of the world."}, {"zh-tw": "Samuel Pierpont Langley 不同他想變得富有，而且他想成名", "en": "Samuel Pierpont Langley was different. He wanted to be rich,and he wanted to be famous."}, {"zh-tw": "他在追求結果他在追求財富", "en": "He was in pursuit of the result. He was in pursuit of the riches."}, {"zh-tw": "所以你們看，看看發生了什麼這些相信萊特兄弟的夢想的人用血汗與淚水和他們一同努力工作的人", "en": "And lo and behold, look what happened. The people who believedin the Wright brothers' dream worked with them with bloodand sweat and tears."}, {"zh-tw": "另外那些人則只是為錢工作而他們述說的故事是每次萊特兄弟出門他們都會帶上五套零件因為這是他們會墜機的次數在他們回家吃飯前", "en": "The others just worked for the paycheck. They tell stories of how every timethe Wright brothers went out, they would have to takefive sets of parts, because that's how many timesthey would crash before supper."}, {"zh-tw": "於是，最後在1903年12月17日萊特兄弟起飛而在場甚至沒有其他人可以體驗它我們在幾天後發現這件事", "en": "And, eventually, on December 17th, 1903, the Wright brothers took flight, and no one was thereto even experience it. We found out about it a few days later."}, {"zh-tw": "更進一步的證明Langley因為錯誤的動機在萊特兄弟起飛那天，離職了他可以說〝那真是很驚人的發現啊而我將在你們的技術上加以改良〞，但他沒有。", "en": "And further proof that Langleywas motivated by the wrong thing: The day the Wright brothers took flight, he quit. He could have said, \"That's an amazing discovery, guys, and I will improveupon your technology,\" but he didn't."}, {"zh-tw": "他跑第一，但他沒有變有錢他沒有變有名，所以他離職人們不會買你買什麼；他們買你的為什麼", "en": "He wasn't first, he didn't get rich,he didn't get famous, so he quit. People don't buy what you do;they buy why you do it."}, {"zh-tw": "而如果你談的是你相信的事物你會吸引那些相信你所相信的人們但為什麼吸吲那些相信你所相信的人們很重要？有種東西叫創意的散播法則如果你不知道這個法則，你絕對知道它的術語", "en": "If you talk about what you believe, you will attract thosewho believe what you believe. But why is it important to attractthose who believe what you believe? Something called the lawof diffusion of innovation, if you don't know the law,you know the terminology."}, {"zh-tw": "在我們人口之中前2.5%的人是發明家接下來的13.5%是早期使用者", "en": "The first 2.5% of our populationare our innovators.

The only reason these peoplebuy touch-tone phones is because you can't buyrotary phones anymore."}, {"zh-tw": "在這個尺度上我們都坐在不同的位置，不同的時間上但創意的散播法則告訴我們的是如果你想要在大眾市場成功或者讓大眾市場接受一個想法你不能擁有它直到你到達了在15％到18％之間的市場占有率的引爆點然後系統就會一面倒到你這邊我喜歡問企業：在新事業上你們的轉換率是多少然後他們會很樂意並驕傲地告訴你：哦，大約10％", "en": "We all sit at various placesat various times on this scale, but what the law of diffusionof innovation tells us is that if you want mass-market successor mass-market acceptance of an idea, you cannot have ituntil you achieve this tipping point between 15 and 18 percentmarket penetration, and then the system tips. I love asking businesses,\"What's your conversion on new business?\" They love to tell you,\"It's about 10 percent,\" proudly."}, {"zh-tw": "嗯，你可以有10％的顧客我們都有約10％的顧客〝知道〞這是我們描述他們的方式，對吧。這就像是膽識，哦，他們就是知道。問題是，你如何找到這些知道的人在你和他們做生意之前以及那些不知道的人所以這就是這裡，一個小小的差距是你必須要填滿的如同Jeffrey Moore稱它為〞跨越分歧因為，你看，早期的多數人不會嘗試直到其他人已經先嘗試", "en": "Well, you can tripover 10% of the customers. We all have about 10% who just \"get it.\" That's how we describe them, right? That's like that gut feeling,\"Oh, they just get it.\" The problem is: How do youfind the ones that get it before doing businessversus the ones who don't get it? So it's this here, this little gapthat you have to close, as Jeffrey Moore calls it,\"Crossing the Chasm\" -- because, you see, the early majoritywill not try something until someone else has tried it first."}, {"zh-tw": "而這些人，這些發明家以及早期的採用者他們對做這些需要膽試的決定感到很自在他們對做這些直覺的決定感到更為自在也就是他們被他們自己對世界的相信所驅動而不僅只是可得的產品", "en": "And these guys, the innovatorsand the early adopters, they're comfortablemaking those gut decisions. They're more comfortablemaking those intuitive decisions that are driven by whatthey believe about the world and not just what product is available."}, {"zh-tw": "這些是排隊排了六個小時買剛上市iPhone的人而其實可以在下個星期走進店裡從架上買一枝手機這些是花40，000美金當平版電視剛上市的人雖然科技還未臻完美", "en": "These are the people who stoodin line for six hours to buy an iPhone when they first came out, when you could have bought oneoff the shelf the next week.

First, the famous failure."}, {"zh-tw": "它是個商業的例子如同我們之前所說，一秒鐘前成功的要素是資金以及適當的人與對的市場狀況", "en": "It's a commercial example.
