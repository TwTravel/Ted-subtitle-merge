The punch line? \"On the other hand, I don't have to get up at four every single morning to milk my Labrador.\" This is a recent cover of New York Magazine. Best hospitals where doctors say they would go for cancer treatment, births, strokes, heart disease, hip replacements, 4 a.m. emergencies."}, {"zh-tw": "這是一首我自己接的歌(音樂)有沒有發現凌晨四點已經變成一種代稱了？它表示，你在世上最糟糕的時間還醒著不方便、悲劇、打哈欠的時間", "en": "And this is a song medley I put together -- (Music) Did you ever notice that four in the morning has become some sort of meme or shorthand? It means something like you are awake at the worst possible hour.
