This is so completely differentto other TV programming."}, {"zh-tw": "我們帶領觀眾一起經歷真實正在發生的事，觀眾身歷其境，搭上了火車、在船上、一群人一起打毛線，我覺得他們這麼做的原因，是因為我們保留原汁原味，即時同步非常重要，這就是我們製作「慢活秀」的重點。那是種我們都能參與，觀眾都能共鳴，而這或許是人類文化的根源。", "en": "We take the viewer on a journeythat happens right now in real time, and the viewer gets the feelingof actually being there, actually being on the train, on the boat, and knitting together with others, and the reason I thinkwhy they're doing that is because we don't edit the timeline. It's important thatwe don't edit the timeline, and it's also importantthat what we make Slow TV about is something that we all can relate to,that the viewer can relate to, and that somehow has a root in our culture."}, {"zh-tw": "這是去年夏天的照片，我們再次做了7個禮拜的海岸航行，當然，這要計畫很多事情，很多後勤支援的準備，", "en": "This is a picture from last summer when we traveled the coastagain for seven weeks.
