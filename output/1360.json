They're fantastic creatures."}, {"zh-tw": "愛爾蘭有許多姥鯊讓我們有幸能研究牠們姥鯊對海洋生態社區也是相當重要的早在幾百年前特別在克拉達、達夫和康尼瑪拉地區獨立農夫會出海乘著漁船出海到一個叫太陽魚淺灘的地方大概離愛奇島48公里以西的位置去捕殺姥鯊", "en": "We're very lucky in Ireland, we have plenty of basking sharksand plenty of opportunities to study them. They were very importantto coastal communities, going back hundreds of years, especially aroundthe Claddaghduff, Connemara region where subsistence farmers used to sailout on their hookers and open boats, sometimes way offshoreto a place called the Sunfish Bank, about 30 miles west of Achill Island, to kill the basking sharks."}, {"zh-tw": "這是來自17, 18世紀的木版畫因為姥鯊肝臟含很多肝油，所以當時地位非凡", "en": "This is a woodcut from about the 1800s. They were very important,for the oil out of their liver."}, {"zh-tw": "肝臟占身體的1/3，滿滿是油從牠們的肝臟就能提鍊出好幾加侖的肝油這些油當時主要供照明用途除此之外也可用來治療傷口等等", "en": "A third of the baskingshark's size is their liver, and it's full of oil, gallons of oil. That oil was used especially for lighting, but also for dressing woundsand other things."}, {"zh-tw": "事實上，在1742年戈爾韋、都柏林和沃特福的路燈多多少少都跟太陽魚肝油有關姥鯊又叫「太陽魚」", "en": "In fact, the streetlights in 1742, of Galway, Dublin and Waterford, were lit with sunfish oil. \"Sunfish\" is one of the wordsfor basking sharks."}, {"zh-tw": "所以牠們算是相當重要的動物歷史久遠，對海洋生態社區也非常重要", "en": "So they were incredibly important animals.

They are awesome creatures."}, {"zh-tw": "住在這裡，使我們可以實際研究、接近牠們我們好幾年來在做的事--去年對我們來說滿重大的我們開始標幟鯊魚這樣才能追蹤牠們的動態以及棲地忠實性", "en": "It gives us a fantastic opportunityto study them, to get access to them. What we've been doing for a coupleyears -- last year was a big year -- is we started tagging sharks, so we could try to get some ideaof sight fidelity and movement and things like that."}, {"zh-tw": "我們主要集中在登內加爾北部和凱里郡西部這兩個區塊我比較熟悉我們標識的方法非常簡單又有點土法煉鋼是用一個又大又長的竿子這是一個beachcaster牌的竿子", "en": "So we concentrated mainlyin North Donegal and West Kerry as the two areaswhere I was mainly active.

Half the challenge to get access is to be in the right placeat the right time."}, {"zh-tw": "來給大家看牠們的樣子我們在船上使用竿子上的相機來拍攝鯊魚", "en": "But it's a very simple, easy technique;I'll show you what it looks like. We use a pole camera on the boatto actually film the shark."}, {"zh-tw": "首先要分辨鯊魚的性別我們也用了一些衛星標，所以也有運用到高科技產品", "en": "One, it's to try and work outthe gender of the shark. We also deployed some satellite tags,so we did use high-tech stuff as well."}, {"zh-tw": "這些是衛星檔案標幟可以儲存資料", "en": "These are archival tags. What they do is store the data."}, {"zh-tw": "衛星標只能在接觸空氣並沒有水的狀況下才能使用並發送訊號給衛星當然，鯊魚和魚類大部份的時間都在水裡所以這個標幟會根據時間和太陽的升降來推斷鯊魚的位置其中也會考量海水的溫度和深淺", "en": "A satellite tag only workswhen the air is clear of the water and can send a signal to the satellite. And sharks and fishare underwater most of the time, so this tag actually works outthe locations of shark, depending on the timingand the setting of the sun, plus water temperature and depth."}, {"zh-tw": "我們必須根據收集的資料重建路線要設定讓標幟在一定的時間後自動脫落我們的設定是八個月時間到了，標幟會浮出水面，傳資料給衛星而且並不是全部的資料，而是讓我們足以使用的資料", "en": "And you have to kind ofreconstruct the path. What happens is, you set the tag to detachfrom the shark after a fixed period -- in this case, eight months -- and literally to the day,the tag popped off, drifted up, said hello to the satellite and sent, not all the data,but enough data for us to use."}, {"zh-tw": "這是唯一可以摸透牠們在水裡行為的辦法這邊是我們做的一些地圖", "en": "This is the only way to really work outtheir behavior and movements when they're underwater. And here's a coupleof maps that we've done."}, {"zh-tw": "可以看到兩個都在凱里郡標幟到鯊魚基本上牠在過去八個月都在愛爾蘭海域活動", "en": "In that one, you can seethat we tagged both off Kerry. Basically, it spent all its time,the last eight months, in Irish waters."}, {"zh-tw": "聖誕節跑到棚緣這個我們還沒實地勘察海面溫度及水深不過，第二隻鯊魚大部份時間也在愛爾蘭海域活動", "en": "On Christmas, it was outon the shelf edge. Here's one we haven't ground-truthed yet with sea-surface temperatureand water depth, but again, the second sharkspent most of its time in and around the Irish Sea."}, {"zh-tw": "去年有一位曼島的同事標到一隻鯊魚在90天以內從曼島跑到加拿大的新斯科舍省去距離有9500公里，相當驚人", "en": "Colleagues from the Isle of Manlast year actually tagged one shark that went from the Isle of Manto Nova Scotia in about 90 days. Nine and a half thousand kilometers --we never thought that happened."}, {"zh-tw": "還有另一個美國的同事在麻省標了大概20隻鯊魚，他的標幟有點故障", "en": "Another colleague in the Statestagged about 20 sharks off Massachusetts. His tags didn't really work."}, {"zh-tw": "只知道標幟的地點和最後浮出來的位置結果他的標幟竟出現在加勒比海甚至在巴西", "en": "All he knows is where he tagged them, and where they popped off. His tags popped off in the Caribbean, and even in Brazil."}, {"zh-tw": "我們以為姥鯊是溫帶動物只能在我們這裡的緯度生存不過事實上，牠們很明顯也會到赤道地區所以我們就是企圖瞭解姥鯊的這些簡單的事情", "en": "We thought basking sharkswere temperate animals and lived in our latitudes, but in actual fact, they're obviouslycrossing the equator as well. So very simple things like that, we're trying to learnabout basking sharks."}, {"zh-tw": "我發現有一件非常奇特的現象就是鯊魚的基因多樣性很低我不是基因學家，也沒有要假裝自己很懂基因學", "en": "One thing that I thinkis a very surprising and strange thing is just how low the geneticdiversity of sharks is. I'm not a geneticist, so I won't pretendto understand the genetics."}, {"zh-tw": "這時候跟別人合作就很棒我擅長田野調查如果要我在實驗室待好幾小時我就會瘋掉", "en": "And that's why it's greatto have collaboration. Whereas I'm a field person, I get panic attacks if I have to spend too many hoursin a lab with a white coat on."}, {"zh-tw": "這時候就可以和擅長這塊的基因學家合作", "en": "Take me away. So we can work with geneticistswho understand that."}, {"zh-tw": "當他們觀察姥鯊的基因就發現基因多樣性極低你看看第一條線就可以看到這些不同種類的鯊魚長得滿相近的這大概就表示牠們都是鯊魚", "en": "So when they looked atthe genetics of basking sharks, they found that the diversitywas incredibly low. If you look at the first line, really, you can see that all these differentshark species are all quite similar."}, {"zh-tw": "且來自相同的祖先如果觀察核苷酸多樣性也就是由父母傳下來的基因會發現姥鯊，看第一份報告多樣性比其他鯊魚種類還低", "en": "I think this means they're all sharks and they've come from a common ancestry. But if you look at nucleotide diversity, which is more geneticsthat are passed on through the parents, you see that basking sharks,if you look at the first study, was order of magnitude less diverseeven than other shark species."}, {"zh-tw": "這份研究在2006年完成在2006年之前，我們對姥鯊的基因多樣性毫無概念", "en": "You can see this workwas only done in 2006. Before 2006, we had no idea of the geneticvariability of basking sharks."}, {"zh-tw": "我們不知道牠們是否分散為不同的族群？那麼次族群又在哪裡？這是很重要的資訊也就是動物的族群及現況英國阿伯丁大學的諾柏覺得這相當不可思議", "en": "We had no idea: Did they distinguishinto different populations? Were there subpopulations? And that's very importantif you want to know what the population size is,and the status of the animals. So, Les Noble in Aberdeen kind of foundthis a bit unbelievable, really."}, {"zh-tw": "於是他做了另一項研究並使用微衛星微衛星更貴又更費時間最後結果卻幾乎一模一樣所以看起來姥鯊的基因多樣性確實極低", "en": "So he did another studyusing microsatellites, which is much more expensive,much more time-consuming, and to his surprise,came up with almost identical results. So it does seem to bethat basking sharks, for some reason, have incredibly low diversity."}, {"zh-tw": "也許這是一個瓶頸，一個基因上的瓶頸可能在12,000年前造成了非常低的多樣性不過你看豆腐鯊另一個以浮游生物為食的大型鯊魚多樣性就高很多", "en": "And it's thought maybeit was a genetic bottleneck, thought to have been 12,000 years ago, and this has caused a very low diversity. And yet, if you look at the whale shark, which is the otherplankton-eating large shark, its diversity is much greater."}, {"zh-tw": "這實在是沒道理他們發現在世界上的姥鯊沒有基因上的差別即使姥鯊分布在世界各地在基因上卻沒有差別不管是大西洋、太平洋、紐西蘭、愛爾蘭或南非", "en": "So it doesn't really make sense at all. They found that there wasno genetic differentiation between any of the world's oceansof basking sharks: even though they're foundthroughout the world, you couldn't tellthe difference, genetically, from one from the Pacific, Atlantic,New Zealand, Ireland, South Africa."}, {"zh-tw": "牠們基本上都一樣這也是相當驚人的發現，很令人感到意外", "en": "They all basically seem the same. Which, again, is kind of surprising;you wouldn't expect that."}, {"zh-tw": "我不懂，也不假裝懂我想大部份的基因學家也感到不解不過他們會產生數據所以你可以根據基因多樣性推算族群的數量", "en": "I don't understand or pretendto understand this; I suspect most geneticists don't either, but they produce the numbers. So you can actually estimatethe population size based on the diversity of the genetics."}, {"zh-tw": "羅斯荷澤計算出相當準確的數字一共有8200隻就這樣世界上就只有八千隻", "en": "And Rus Hoelzel came up withan effective population size: 8,200 animals. That's it -- 8,000 animals in the world."}, {"zh-tw": "你一定會覺得「這太扯了，不可能」不過諾柏做了更精確的研究結果數字大概落在9000使用不同的微衛星得到不同結果不過所有的研究平均出來--平均數為5000我個人不相信這份報告結果", "en": "You're thinking,\"That's ridiculous. No way.\" So Les did a finer study, and he found out it came out about 9,000. Using different microsatellitesgave the different results, but the mean of all thesestudies is about 5,000, which I personally don't believe."}, {"zh-tw": "不過我這個人一向就會抱持懷疑的態度但就算你把數字換一換有效的族群數字也大概在20,000隻", "en": "But then, I am a skeptic. But even if you toss a few numbers around, you're probably talking an effectivepopulation of about 20,000 animals."}, {"zh-tw": "記不記得70年代和50年代我們在阿基爾島殺了多少隻鯊魚？所以這個數據其實是要告訴我們這個種類面臨絕種的危機因為牠們的族群很小事實上，在那20,000當中，其中只有8000隻是母的", "en": "Do you remember how many they killedoff Achill in the 70s and the 50s? So what it tells us, actually, is that there's actually a riskof extinction of this species because its population is so small. In fact, of those 20,000, 8,000 were thought to be females."}, {"zh-tw": "全世界就只有8000隻母姥鯊？我不知道，我不相信問題在於基因學家受困於樣本", "en": "There's only 8,000 basking sharkfemales in the world? I don't know. I don't believe it. The problem with thisis they were constrained with samples."}, {"zh-tw": "他們沒有足夠的樣本來仔細去研究這些基因那到底要從哪裡去蒐集到需要的基因樣本呢？一個滿明顯的來源就是死掉的鯊魚沖上岸的死鯊魚", "en": "They didn't get enough samples to really explore the geneticsin enough detail. So, where do you get samples fromfor your genetic analysis? Well, one obvious source is dead sharks -- dead sharks, washed up."}, {"zh-tw": "愛爾蘭每年大概會有2-3隻死鯊魚被沖上岸假如我們幸運的話另一個來源就是漁業混獲", "en": "We might get two or three dead sharkswashed up in Ireland a year, if we're kind of lucky. Another source would befisheries' bycatch."}, {"zh-tw": "我們在海洋漂網中捕獲過蠻多條姥鯊的此活動現在已立法禁止，這對鯊魚是個好消息", "en": "We were getting quite a few caughtin surface drift nets. That's banned now, and that'll begood news for the sharks."}, {"zh-tw": "還有一些是由魚網、拖網捕捉到的這一條是在聖誕節都柏林的后斯地區非法捕到的因為歐盟法律已禁止這種行為在這之前，鯊魚肉事實上是以一公斤8歐元的價錢賣出", "en": "And some are caught in nets, in trawls. This is a shark that was actuallylanded in Howth just before Christmas -- illegally, because you're not allowedto do that under EU law -- and was actually soldfor eight euros a kilo as shark steak."}, {"zh-tw": "在牆上還會有食譜教你怎麼烹煮鯊魚煙這些人後來有被罰錢", "en": "They even put a recipe up on the wall, until they were told it was illegal. They actually did get a fine for that."}, {"zh-tw": "那麼如果看這些研究報告全世界的樣本總數為86條可見這是非常重要的工作也可以從中發現很重要的問題這些報告能顯示族群大小亞群數量及其結構不過因樣本數的不足而導致研究受限制", "en": "So if you look atall those studies I showed you, the total number of samples worldwide is 86, at present. So it's very important work, and they can asksome really good questions, and tell us about population sizeand subpopulations and structure, but they're constrainedby lack of samples."}, {"zh-tw": "我們出海標鯊魚時這是我們標鯊魚肋骨的方法-動作迅速-有時候鯊魚也會反抗有一次我們在多尼戈爾的馬林角地區一隻鯊魚用牠的尾鰭衝撞船的側身我想是因為船離牠很近而受驚而不是因為我們要作標幟", "en": "When we were out tagging our sharks -- this is how we tagged them on the frontof a RIB, get in there fast -- occasionally, the sharks do react. On one occasion, when we wereup in Malin Head in Donegal, the shark smacked the sideof the boat with his tail, more, I think, in startle to the factthat a boat came near it, rather than the tag going in."}, {"zh-tw": "但那沒關係，只不過是淋溼了而已還有一次我跟艾密特要回馬林頭碼頭我注意到船前有黑色的黏液", "en": "And that was fine. We got wet. No problem. And then when myself and Emmettgot back to Malin Head, to the pier, I noticed some black slimeon the front of the boat."}, {"zh-tw": "這時我就想起-我以前待過漁船-我記得漁夫告訴我只要魚網裡有姥鯊就會留下黑色的黏液所以我就心想那一定是姥鯊留下來的黏液", "en": "I used to spend a lot of timeon commercial fishing boats, and I remember fishermen saying they can tell when a basking sharkhas been caught in a net, because it leaves a black slime behind. So that must have come from the shark."}, {"zh-tw": "我們一直想取得組織樣本來作基因研究因為這些樣本非常寶貴我們會用傳統方法我會拿一個石弓，在這裡會看到我手中的石弓我們也會用這個來取鯨魚及海豚樣本來作基因研究", "en": "Now, we had an interestin getting tissue samples for genetics because we knew they were very valuable. We would use conventional methods; I have a crossbow --you see it in my hand there, which we use to sample whalesand dolphins for genetic studies as well."}, {"zh-tw": "我就試了那個方法，試遍各種方法但結果石弓都斷了因為鯊魚的皮太硬", "en": "So I tried that, I tried many techniques. All it was doing was breaking my arrows, because the shark's skinis just so strong."}, {"zh-tw": "想用這種方法取樣本是不可能的那是行不通的", "en": "There was no way we were goingto get a sample from that. That wasn't going to work."}, {"zh-tw": "所以當我看到船前的黑色黏液我就想「何不拿這個現成的東西...」我就把黏液刮下來然後跟酒精一起裝在一個小試管裡送去給基因學家", "en": "So when I saw the black slimeon the bow of the boat, I thought, \"If you takewhat you're given in this world ...\" So I scraped it off. I had a little tube with alcohol in itto send to the geneticists."}, {"zh-tw": "我把黏液刮下送去阿伯丁我就說「可以試試這個」於是他們研究好幾個月因為我們在曼島有個會議我就不斷寄信問", "en": "So I scraped the slime offand sent it to Aberdeen, and said, \"You might try that.\" And they sat on it for months. It was only because we hada conference on the Isle of Man."}, {"zh-tw": "「你有抽空檢查我的黏液了嗎？」他就會敷衍回答「有啦，晚一點」後來他就著手去做了因為我們未曾見面所以如果沒有幫我看就很丟臉結果他竟然在黏液中真的找到基因了", "en": "But I kept emailing Les, saying, \"Have you had a chanceto look at my slime?\" And he was like, \"Yeah, yeah. Later.\" He thought he'd better do itbecause I never met him before; he might lose face if he hadn't donethe thing I sent him. And he was amazed that they actuallygot DNA from the slime."}, {"zh-tw": "於是就把基因放大拿去作實驗實驗結果發現這就是姥鯊的基因而且是從黏液中取得的於是他就非常興奮", "en": "They amplified it and they tested it, and they found, yes,this was actually basking shark DNA, which was got from the slime. So he was very excited."}, {"zh-tw": "後來就有「賽門的鯊魚黏液」之稱我當時就想「我搞不好可以從這裡出發」我就想我們何不出去蒐集夠多黏液所以我們標了3500個衛星標", "en": "It became known as \"Simon's shark slime.\" And I thought, \"Hey, you know,I can build on this.\" So we thought, OK, we're going to tryto get out and get some slime.

You probably sawthe humpback whale footage we got a month or two agooff County Wexford."}, {"zh-tw": "我們總是想在這世界上留名而我一直在擔心這些座頭鯨和海豚遭殺害不過有時候就是會有一些小東西自動送上門來你就只能乖乖接收了這可能會是我遺留給這世界的遺產吧", "en": "And you always thinkyou might have some legacy you can leave the world behind, and I was thinking of humpbackwhales breaching and dolphins. But hey -- sometimesthese things are sent to you and you just have to take themwhen they come."}, {"zh-tw": "賽門的鯊魚黏液而我們今年籌得更多資金去蒐集更多樣本", "en": "So this is possiblygoing to be my legacy -- Simon's Shark Slime. We got more money this year to carry on collectingmore and more samples."}, {"zh-tw": "有個非常有用的東西我們使用高竿攝影-這是我的同事裘安拿著高竿攝影機-就可以從鯊魚下方觀察牠們雄姥鯊有鰭腳（生殖器官）是一個長在姥鯊背後的垂狀物", "en": "One thing that is very usefulis that we use a pole camera -- this is my colleague, Joanne,with a pole camera -- where you can look underneath the shark.
