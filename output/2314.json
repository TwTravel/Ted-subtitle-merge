For much of this time,this assistance was manual."}, {"zh-tw": "監控的發生靠人力，而且線路是由人工架接的，往來電話被錄到錄音帶裡去；", "en": "Surveillance took place manuallyand wires were connected by hand. Calls were recorded to tape."}, {"zh-tw": "不過就像許多他產業一樣，電腦運算已經改變了每一件事情。電信公司把監控功能建置在它們網路的最核心處，", "en": "But as in so many other industries, computing has changed everything. The telephone companiesbuilt surveillance features into the very core of their networks."}, {"zh-tw": "我要大家好好思索一下這個：我們的電話和承載我們收發話線路網被架線是以監控當優先考量 －「最優先而且最重要的」。", "en": "I want that to sink in for a second: Our telephones and the networksthat carry our calls were wired for surveillance first. First and foremost."}, {"zh-tw": "這個意思就是當你與你的另一半、小孩、同事、醫生正在講電話時，某人可以正在聽著。那個某人可能是你們自己的政府，也可以是其他國的政府、某個外事情報人員、駭客、從事犯罪行為者、追蹤者，或是破解進入監控系統的任何其他利益團體，「駭」進了電信公司的監控系統。", "en": "So what that means is thatwhen you're talking to your spouse, your children, a colleagueor your doctor on the telephone, someone could be listening. Now, that someone mightbe your own government; it could also be another government,a foreign intelligence service, or a hacker, or a criminal, or a stalker or any other party that breaks intothe surveillance system, that hacks into the surveillance systemof the telephone companies."}, {"zh-tw": "不過在電信公司當作優先要務完成監控系統之建置的時候，矽谷科技公司們就沒這麼做了，而且在過去幾年下來，越來越普遍地矽谷科技公司把強大的加密技術打造進它們的通訊產品，這使得監控變得極度地困難。", "en": "But while the telephone companieshave built surveillance as a priority, Silicon Valley companies have not. And increasingly,over the last couple years, Silicon Valley companies have builtstrong encryption technology into their communications products that makes surveillanceextremely difficult."}, {"zh-tw": "比方說你們之中的許多人也許都有 iPhone，要是你使用 iPhone 來傳送簡訊傳給其他也有 iPhone 的人，那些簡訊是無法輕易就被人側錄走的；而事實上據 「蘋果」 所言，他們自己也沒辦法看到簡訊內容。", "en": "For example, many of youmight have an iPhone, and if you use an iPhoneto send a text message to other people who have an iPhone, those text messagescannot easily be wiretapped. And in fact, according to Apple, they're not able to even seethe text messages themselves."}, {"zh-tw": "同樣地如果你使用 FaceTime 與你的朋友或是深愛之人做視訊通話或者錄影通話的話，那也一樣無法輕易就被人監聽到的。而且不只是「蘋果」而已，", "en": "Likewise, if you use FaceTimeto make an audio call or a video call with one of yourfriends or loved ones, that, too, cannot be easily wiretapped. And it's not just Apple."}, {"zh-tw": "現在被「臉書」所持有、全世界上億人口所使用的「Whatsapp」，也已經把強大的加密系統建置在它的產品裡面；這代表在「聖公會南半球聯盟」裡面的人能夠輕鬆地連絡而沒有政府 － 通常是專制政府 － 來側錄他們的簡訊。所以在有辦法隨時隨地聽取任何電話收發話的 100 年後，你也許想像得出來政府官員是非常不高興的，", "en": "WhatsApp, which is now owned by Facebook and used by hundreds of millionsof people around the world, also has built strongencryption technology into its product, which means that peoplein the Global South can easily communicate without their governments,often authoritarian, wiretapping their text messages. So, after 100 years of being ableto listen to any telephone call -- anytime, anywhere -- you might imagine that governmentofficials are not very happy."}, {"zh-tw": "而且事實上那是持續在發生的事情，政府官員們超極火大，", "en": "And in fact, that's what's happening. Government officials are extremely mad."}, {"zh-tw": "他們並不是因為這些加密工具是現在可到手的而火大，讓他們最生氣的是科技公司已經把加密功能建置進了它們的產品裡面，而且透過預設把它們啟動著，", "en": "And they're not mad becausethese encryption tools are now available. What upsets them the most is that the tech companies have builtencryption features into their products and turned them on by default."}, {"zh-tw": "預設這檔事才是重點。簡單來說科技公司已經讓加密技術民主化了，", "en": "It's the default piece that matters. In short, the tech companieshave democratized encryption."}, {"zh-tw": "也因此就像英國首相大衛．卡麥隆的政府官員們，他們相信所有的通訊 － 電子郵件、簡訊、語音留言，所有這一切對政府而言應該是可到手的，而加密技術正使得這件事情變棘手的。聽好！我極度支持他們的觀點 －", "en": "And so, government officialslike British Prime Minister David Cameron, they believe that all communications --emails, texts, voice calls -- all of these should beavailable to governments, and encryption is making that difficult. Now, look -- I'm extremely sympatheticto their point of view."}, {"zh-tw": "「我們活在一個危險的時點、在一個危險的世界，真的有壞人就在外面，有著恐怖分子和其他嚴重的國家安全威脅」，我猜我們全都想要聯邦調查局和國土安全部來監查吧。", "en": "We live in a dangerous timein a dangerous world, and there really are bad people out there. There are terrorists and otherserious national security threats that I suspect we all wantthe FBI and the NSA to monitor."}, {"zh-tw": "但是這些監控功能帶有著一個成本，理由就是並沒有叫做「恐怖分子的筆電」或是「毒品商的手機」這樣子的東西，", "en": "But those surveillancefeatures come at a cost. The reason for that is that there is no such thingas a terrorist laptop, or a drug dealer's cell phone."}, {"zh-tw": "我們都使用著相同的通訊設備；這所代表的意思就是假若毒品商的電話往來或是恐怖份子的電話往來可以被攔截，然後剩下來的我們這些人也一樣可以如此被攔截。", "en": "We all use the samecommunications devices. What that means is thatif the drug dealers' telephone calls or the terrorists' telephone callscan be intercepted, then so can the rest of ours, too."}, {"zh-tw": "而我認為我們確實需要去問：「世界上十億的人口應該使用如此便於受監聽的設備嗎？」我剛講過駭進監控系統這場景並非是假想的，在 2009 年時「谷歌」和「微軟」應警方合法的監控要求而建立在他們網絡裡的監控系統被中國政府所破解了；因為中國政府想找出美國政府正在監視他們的哪一位特務。", "en": "And I think we really need to ask: Should a billion peoplearound the world be using devices that are wiretap friendly? So the scenario of hacking of surveillancesystems that I've described -- this is not imaginary. In 2009, the surveillance systems that Googleand Microsoft built into their networks -- the systems that they use to respondto lawful surveillance requests from the police -- those systems were compromisedby the Chinese government, because the Chinese governmentwanted to figure out which of their own agentsthe US government was monitoring."}, {"zh-tw": "在 2004 年同樣的舉動，建立在希臘最大的電信公司 －「渥達豐」網絡裡的監控系統被一個找不著人的個體所破解，而那個監控功能被用來監聽希臘總理與內閣成員的收發話，做這件事的其他國政府或是駭客始終沒有被逮到。", "en": "By the same token, in 2004, the surveillance systembuilt into the network of Vodafone Greece --Greece's largest telephone company -- was compromised by an unknown entity, and that feature,the surveillance feature, was used to wiretapthe Greek Prime Minister and members of the Greek cabinet. The foreign government or hackerswho did that were never caught."}, {"zh-tw": "沒錯，有這些這些監控系統或是暗門帶來很麻煩的事情，當你打造一個暗門進到通訊網絡或是科技的一小部分裡面時，你無沒掌控好誰會越過這道暗門的，", "en": "And really, this gets to the very problemwith these surveillance features, or backdoors. When you build a backdoorinto a communications network or piece of technology, you have no way of controllingwho's going to go through it."}, {"zh-tw": "你沒辦法掌控到底是你這邊的人還是其他方的人、到底是好人還是壞蛋。所以衝著這理由我認為 －建立一個盡可能戒備森嚴的網絡是比較好的，", "en": "You have no way of controlling whether it'll be used by your sideor the other side, by good guys, or by bad guys. And so for that reason,I think that it's better to build networksto be as secure as possible."}, {"zh-tw": "是的這意味著在未來加密技術將會讓監聽更為困難，那意味著警察抓壞蛋即將會有更為艱辛的時間了；", "en": "Yes, this means that in the future, encryption is going to makewiretapping more difficult. It means that the policeare going to have a tougher time catching bad guys."}, {"zh-tw": "但是替代選項意味著要活在一個任何人的電話、簡訊可以被從事犯罪行為者、跟蹤者、外事情報特務來監控，而我不想活在那樣的世界裡。", "en": "But the alternative would meanto live in a world where anyone's calls or anyone'stext messages could be surveilled by criminals, by stalkersand by foreign intelligence agencies. And I don't want to livein that kind of world."}, {"zh-tw": "所以此時你大概有阻撓許多形式政府監控的工具，已經在你的手機上頭、在你的口袋裡，你只是可能不瞭解那些工具有多強大、多安全，或是至今你用來傳遞訊息之其他方法確實是有多不牢靠的。因此我要給你的中心理念就是這個 －「我們需要用這些工具」；", "en": "And so right now,you probably have the tools to thwart many kindsof government surveillance already on your phonesand already in your pockets, you just might not realize how strongand how secure those tools are, or how weak the other waysyou've used to communicate really are. And so, my message to you is this: We need to use these tools."}, {"zh-tw": "我們需要保護好我們的電話往來、我們需要保護好我們的簡訊，", "en": "We need to secure our telephone calls. We need to secure our text messages."}, {"zh-tw": "我希望你們利用這些工具，我希望你告訴你們深愛之人、同事 －「使用加密的傳遞訊息工具！」，", "en": "I want you to use these tools. I want you to tell your loved ones,I want you to tell your colleagues: Use these encrypted communications tools."}, {"zh-tw": "不要只是因為便宜和簡單來使用它們，卻是因為安全才使用它們。謝謝大家！", "en": "Don't just use thembecause they're cheap and easy, but use them because they're secure. Thank you."}], "title": "Christopher Soghoian A Brief History Of Phone Wiretapping And How To Avoid It"}
