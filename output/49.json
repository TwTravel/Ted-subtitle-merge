I don't have much time to do it. And I want to reinforce three ideaswith that rapid-fire presentation."}, {"zh-tw": "我把第一個概念稱為超理性過程.這個過程把理性提高到一個難以置信的境界以至於它超越了通常伴隨(人們常說的), 理性結論的所有累贅.", "en": "The first is what I like to calla hyper-rational process. It's a process that takes rationalityalmost to an absurd level, and it transcends all the baggage that normally comeswith what people would call, sort of a rationalconclusion to something."}, {"zh-tw": "這個過程產生了一些你將會看到的結論事實上這些結論很難讓人相信是理性推斷的結果.第二個概念, 哦,第二個概念是一個沒有署名的過程.", "en": "And it concludes in somethingthat you see here, that you actually wouldn't expectas being the result of rationality. The second -- the second is that this processdoes not have a signature."}, {"zh-tw": "這個過程沒有創造者. 設計師癡迷於創造者.", "en": "There is no authorship. Architects are obsessed with authorship."}, {"zh-tw": "這個過程主要是團隊的合作和修改編輯實際上, 在這個過程中,我們看不到設計師照傳統產生忽略細節的設計草圖第三個概念,短時間內很難解釋為甚麼,把這些概念都聯繫起來它挑戰了極端現代主義概念上的靈活性", "en": "This is something that hasediting and it has teams, but in fact, we no longersee within this process, the traditional master architect creating a sketchthat his minions carry out. And the third is that it challenges -- and this is, in the length of this,very hard to support why, connect all these things -- but it challenges the high modernistnotion of flexibility."}, {"zh-tw": "極端現代主義者主張建立一種普遍的線性空間在這些空間內, 任何事都可以發生我把這個稱為散彈式(漫無目標)的靈活性.(就好像) 轉頭, 射擊, 你肯定能射中些什麼.", "en": "High modernists said we will createsort of singular spaces that are generic, almost anything can happen within them. I call it sort of \"shotgun flexibility\" -- turn your head this way; shoot;and you're bound to kill something."}, {"zh-tw": "所以, 這就是極端現代主義的思想:在一個單一的空間, 實際上任何行為都可以發生.但是我們同時也看到經營費用會超過資本成本從設計參數上來說.", "en": "So, this is the promise of high modernism: within a single space, actually,any kind of activity can happen. But as we're seeing, operational costs are startingto dwarf capital costs in terms of design parameters."}, {"zh-tw": "所以, 這種思想,導致了, 無論是落成時完成的建築設計或者說, 最當前的需要,都會阻礙任何將來可能發生的變化我們推薦一種不同的靈活性,稱之為\"分類靈活性\".基本思想就是, 在統一的整體中,確定一系列的點, (然後)根據這些點來設計.", "en": "And so, with this sort of idea, what happens is, whatever actuallyis in the building on opening day, or whatever seems to bethe most immediate need, starts to dwarf the possibilityand sort of subsume it, of anything else could ever happen. And so we're proposinga different kind of flexibility, something that we call\"compartmentalized flexibility.\" And the idea is that you,within that continuum, identify a series of points,and you design specifically to them."}, {"zh-tw": "這些點也許會有點偏離中心,但事實上最終你會得到你原先期望的效果.極端現代主義的靈活性就沒有這樣的結果.", "en": "They can be pushedoff-center a little bit, but in the end you actuallystill get as much of that original spectrumas you originally had hoped. With high modernist flexibility,that doesn't really work."}, {"zh-tw": "接著我要介紹 -- 西雅圖中心圖書館的設計.用你看到的大概五六個圖,我是說你看到的就是(真正的)設計過程.和圖書館工作人員與圖書館委員會一起,我們選定兩個核心定位.", "en": "Now I'm going to talk about -- I'm going to build upthe Seattle Central Library in this way before your eyesin about five or six diagrams, and I truly mean this is the designprocess that you'll see. With the library staffand the library board, we settled on two core positions."}, {"zh-tw": "這是第一個, 它顯示了, 在過去的900年中,書本和其他技術的發展.這個圖就是我們對於書本的定位我們的定位是, 書本就是技術-這是人們總是忘記的事 -但書本就是一種形式的技術, 它必須和其他真正強大的技術共同分享它的領導性.", "en": "This is the first one, and thisis showing, over the last 900 years, the evolution of the book,and other technologies. This diagram was our sortof position piece about the book, and our position was,books are technology -- that's something people forget -- but it's a form of technologythat will have to share its dominance with any other form of truly potenttechnology or media."}, {"zh-tw": "第二個前提 - 這個前提一開始我們費了好大勁說服圖書管理員們 -就是圖書館, 自從美國卡耐基圖書館傳統的開始就具有第二個責任, 這個責任就是它的社交地位.我會回頭解釋這點, 但是事實上,圖書管理員們, 一開始說, \"不, 這不是我們的責任,", "en": "The second premise -- and this was somethingthat was very difficult for us to convince the librarians of at first -- is that libraries, since the inceptionof Carnegie Library tradition in America, had a second responsibility,and that was for social roles. Ok, now, this I'll come backto later, but something -- actually, the librarians at first said,\"No, this isn't our mandate."}, {"zh-tw": "我們的責任是傳媒, 特別是書本.\"所以你現在看到的實際上是這個建築的設計.上面這個圖是我們在根據極端現代主義靈活性設計的所有現代圖書館中看到的.", "en": "Our mandate is media,and particularly the book.\" So what you're seeing nowis actually the design of the building. The upper diagram is what we had seen in a whole host of contemporary librariesthat used high modernist flexibility."}, {"zh-tw": "看上去好像, 任何事都可能在任何地方發生.我們不了解圖書館的未來, 不了解書籍的未來,所以我們採用這種方法.", "en": "Sort of, any activitycould happen anywhere. We don't know the future of the library;we don't know the future of the book; and so, we'll use this approach."}, {"zh-tw": "我們看到的是, 所有的建築都非常統一普通,更糟的是, 不只是所有的建築都很普通 -不僅僅是閱覽室看上去像復印室看上去像雜誌區 -它還顯示了,圖書館在想要包含所有的活動的時候所遇到的問題.在這種情況下, 包含進設計的,就是這些由書本延伸出去的社交地位.", "en": "And what we saw were buildingsthat were very generic, and worse -- not only were they very generic -- so, not only does the reading roomlook like the copy room look like the magazine area -- but it meant that whatever issuewas troubling the library at that moment was starting to engulf every otheractivity that was happening in it. And in this case,what was getting engulfed were these social responsibilitiesby the expansion of the book."}, {"zh-tw": "所以我們推薦了下端這個圖.非常傻的方法:", "en": "And so we proposedwhat's at the lower diagram. Very dumb approach:simply compartmentalize."}, {"zh-tw": "簡單分類. 把所有我們能預見的發展放在一起 -我不是說我們能預見將來一定會發生的事,但是我們能確定大致的範疇對於將來會發生的事 -把那些(預見)放在特別設計的方框內,然後把不能預測的事情放在頂上.這是核心的思想.", "en": "Put those things whose evolutionwe could predict -- and I don't mean that we could saywhat would actually happen in the future, but we have some certainty of the spectrumof what would happen in the future -- put those in boxes designedspecifically for it, and put the things that we can'tpredict on the rooftops. So that was the core idea."}, {"zh-tw": "現在, 我們必須說服圖書館, 社交地位和傳媒地位是同樣重要的為了使圖書館接受這個思想.你們現在看到左邊的就是他們的程序.", "en": "Now, we had to convince the library that social roles wereequally important to media, in order to get them to accept this. What you're seeing here is actuallytheir program on the left."}, {"zh-tw": "和我們拿到它的時候一樣清楚.我們第一步是重新消化這個程序然後回頭展示給他們說,\"知道嗎? 我們一點沒動過這個程序,但是只有三分之一的程序是致力於傳媒和書籍.", "en": "That's as it was given to usin all of its clarity and glory. Our first operation was to re-digest itback to them, show it to them and say, \"You know what? We haven't touched it, but only one-third of your own programis dedicated to media and books."}, {"zh-tw": "三分之二有關於 -- 就是下面這個白色部分你認為不重要的事情:就是和社交功能有關.\"因此, 一旦我們向他們這樣展示,他們同意這樣的核心概念行的通.我們獲得同意後回到了最初的原則 --這就是第三個圖. 我們重新組合了一切.", "en": "Two-thirds of it is already dedicated -- that's the white band below,the thing you said isn't important -- is already dedicated to social functions.\" So once we had presentedthat back to them, they agreed that this sortof core concept could work. We got the right to go backto first principles -- that's the third diagram."}, {"zh-tw": "然後開始重新做決定.", "en": "We recombined everything. And then we started making new decisions."}, {"zh-tw": "你看到右邊這個就是圖書館的設計,特別是它的面積.在圖的左邊,這裡,你會看到一系列的五個平台 --梳理整合後的程序.", "en": "What you're seeing on the rightis the design of the library, specifically in terms of square footage. On the left of that diagram, here,you'll see a series of five platforms -- sort of combs, collective programs."}, {"zh-tw": "右邊的是比較中間過度性的空間,比如說閱覽室, 這種空間的發展在20, 30, 40年之後我們不能預測.這就是這個建築的最初設計.", "en": "And on the right are the moreindeterminate spaces; things like reading rooms, whose evolution in 20, 30, 40 yearswe can't predict. So that literally was the designof the building."}, {"zh-tw": "他們認同了這個設計, 令他們懊惱的是,一個星期之後我們回頭, 向他們展示了這個.正如你所看到的, 就是右邊的這個圖.我們就是改了一下大小", "en": "They signed it, and to their chagrin, we came back a week later,and we presented them this. And as you can see, it is literallythe diagram on the right."}, {"zh-tw": "我說真的.圖左邊的這些那些是方框.", "en": "We just sized -- no, really,I mean that, literally. The things on the left-hand sideof the diagram, those are the boxes."}, {"zh-tw": "我們重新定大小成了五個類別.它們超級有效. 我們可供使用的成本很低.", "en": "We sized them into five compartments.They're super-efficient. We had a very low budget to work with."}, {"zh-tw": "我們移動這些方框來組建非常清楚的相互關係.閱覽室應該可以看見水面.", "en": "We pushed them around on the site to make very literalcontextual relationships. The reading roomshould be able to see the water."}, {"zh-tw": "主入口前面應該有一個公共廣場為了滿足劃區的原則,等等.你看到的這五個平台 --", "en": "The main entrance should havea public plaza in front of it to abide by the zoning code, and so forth. So, you see the five platforms,those are the boxes."}, {"zh-tw": "也就是這五個方框 -- 每一個方框內都有一件不同的用途.這之間的區域是城市的聯結處,我們不能預測它們未來的發展.", "en": "within each one, a very discretething is happening. The area in betweenis sort of an urban continuum, these things that we can't predicttheir evolution to the same degree."}, {"zh-tw": "為了讓你感受一下這個設計的強大性,我們來看看這個最大的方塊, 我們稱作圖書螺旋.它事實上建起來很便宜就是一個圖書的停車庫.", "en": "To give you some senseof the power of this idea, the biggest blockis what we call the book spiral. It's literally builtin a very inexpensive way -- it is a parking garage for books."}, {"zh-tw": "它正好就在這個建築的六到十層,但這不一定意味著花銷佷高.同時這個設計使得我們能夠用一種連續的方式來組織整個杜威十進制系統:無論它怎樣在這個建築中增長或減小,很明顯它總是很清楚能避免我們在公共圖書館經歷的(找不到書)沮喪.", "en": "It just so happens to be on the 6ththrough 10th floors of the building, but that is not necessarilyan expensive approach. And it allows us to organizethe entire Dewey Decimal System on one continuous run; no matter how itgrows or contracts within the building, it will always have its clarityto end the sort of trail of tears that we've all experiencedin public libraries."}, {"zh-tw": "所以最後的一步, 就是把這些方框放到一起用一個外表固定.這個外表有兩個功能,", "en": "And so this was the final operation, which was to take these blocksas they were all pushed off kilter, and to hold onto them with a skin. That skin serves double duty,again, for economics."}, {"zh-tw": "第一, 就是整個建築的橫向穩定性:這是一個結構上的要素. 但是它不光是為了結構而設計,同時也要固定住每一塊玻璃.", "en": "One, it is the lateral stabilityfor the entire building; it's a structural element. But its dimensions were designednot only for structure, but also for holding onevery piece of glass."}, {"zh-tw": "玻璃然後就融為一體但它還有一層抗壓金屬.這個金屬起到了百葉窗的作用,從建築的外部, 陽光不能完全透過,但從建築內部看又是完全透明.接著我要帶你參觀整個建築.", "en": "The glass was then --I'll use the word impregnated -- but it had a layer of metalthat was called \"stretched metal.\" That metal acts as a microlouver, so from the exterior of the building,the sun sees it as totally opaque, but from the interior,it's entirely transparent. So now I'm going to take youon a tour of the building."}, {"zh-tw": "看看我能不能找到這個. 對所有人, --如果你容易暈車, 我很抱歉.", "en": "Let me see if I can find it. For anyone who getsmotion sickness, I apologize."}, {"zh-tw": "這就是這個建築.我認為值得注意的是, 當我們最初展示這個建築時,公眾認為它完全是出於我們一時的心血來潮和自大.", "en": "So, this is the building. And I think what's important is,when we first unveiled the building, the public saw it as beingtotally about our whim and ego."}, {"zh-tw": "不管你信不信, 圖書管理員們為我們辯護. 他們說,我們不知道它到底是什麼, 但是我們知道這是所有我們需要的根據我們在整個過程中的觀察. \"這個是其中一個入口.", "en": "And it was defended,believe it or not, by the librarians. They said, \"Look,we don't know what it is, but we know it's everythingthat we need it to be, based on the observationsthat we've done about the program.\" This is going into one of the entries."}, {"zh-tw": "所以對於一個公共圖書館來說這是一座不尋常的建築.很顯然.接著我們進入到閱覽室 -- 抱歉, 這是大廳.", "en": "So, it's an unusual buildingfor a public library, obviously. So now we're goinginto what we call the living room."}, {"zh-tw": "這是我們和這個圖書館一起開發的程序眾所周知, 公共圖書館是最後一點免費的公共場所.", "en": "This is actually a programthat we invented with the library. It was recognizing that public libraries are the last vestige of public free space."}, {"zh-tw": "有足夠的商場下雨的時候你可以去在西雅圖市中心,但是沒有很多免費的場所讓你躲雨.這是一個沒有確定目的自由場地, 人們基本上可以做任何事,包括吃東西, 叫喊, 下棋, 等等.", "en": "There are plenty of shopping mallsthat allow you to get out of the rain in downtown Seattle, but there are not so many free places that allow you to get out of the rain. So this was an unprogrammed area wherepeople could pretty much do anything, including eat, yell,play chess and so forth."}, {"zh-tw": "接著我們移到我們稱作混合區.這是這個建築的主要場地.", "en": "Now we're moving up into what we callthe mixing chamber. That was the maintechnology area in the building."}, {"zh-tw": "讓我知道如果我的速度太快了.再往上.", "en": "You'll have to tell meif I'm going too fast for you. And now up."}, {"zh-tw": "這個地方我們放進這個建築好讓我向我妻子求婚. 就是這.她同意了.", "en": "This is actually the placethat we put into the building so I could proposeto my wife, right there. She said yes."}, {"zh-tw": "我的時間不夠了, 就此打住.以後再給你看.", "en": "I'm running out of time,so I'm actually going to stop. I can show this to you later."}, {"zh-tw": "但我們看看能否快速地進入圖書螺旋,因為我認為, 如我提到, 最 --這是主閱覽室 -- 建築中最獨特的部分.有沒有頭暈?這二", "en": "But let's see if I can very quicklyget into the book spiral, because I think it's,as I said, the most -- this is the main reading room --the most unique part of the building. You dizzy yet? Ok, so here, this is the book spiral."}, {"zh-tw": "很難看清,但它實際上是一個連續的樓梯.它讓你, 在一個街區的距離,上一層樓, 所以這是一個連續上升的階梯.", "en": "So, it's very indiscernible, but it's actuallya continuous stair-stepping. It allows you to, on one city block, go up one full floor,so that it's on a continuum."}, {"zh-tw": "好, 現在我要回來, 介紹第二個項目.我將很快的介紹這個.", "en": "Ok, now I'm going to go back,and I'm going to hit a second project. I'm going to go very,very quickly through this."}, {"zh-tw": "這個是達拉斯劇院. 這是一個因為他們找上我們, 說,我們需要你建一個新的建築. 我們已經在", "en": "Now this is the Dallas Theater. It was an unusual client for us,because they came to us and they said, \"We need you to do a new building."}, {"zh-tw": "一個臨時的地方工作了30年.但由於是一個臨時的場所,我們變成了一個籍籍無名的劇院.劇院真正是集中在紐約, 芝加哥和西雅圖,一個例外就是達拉斯劇院.\"他們在臨時場所工作, 實際上意味著, 他們可以為了貝克特炸毀一座牆;他們可以演\"櫻桃園\", 並且在地板上炸一個洞, 等等.", "en": "We've been workingin a temporary space for 30 years, but because of that temporary space, we've become an infamous theater company. Theater is really focused in New York,Chicago and Seattle, with the exceptionof the Dallas Theater Company.\" And the very fact that they workedin a provisional space meant that for Beckett,they could blow out a wall; they could do \"Cherry Orchard\" and blowa hole through the floor, and so forth."}, {"zh-tw": "對我們來說建一座新樓是一件很嚇人的任務要保持完整無缺的建築,又要保持這種實驗性的特色.另外, 他們是我們所稱的多形式劇院: 他們有不同形式的表演.", "en": "So it was a very daunting taskfor us to do a brand-new building that could be a pristine building, but keep this kind of experimental nature. And the second is, they were what we calla multi-form theater, they do different kindsof performances in repertory."}, {"zh-tw": "早上會在舞台上演,然後又在台前, 諸如此類.所以他們需要能夠很快的在不同劇院結構之間變化,因為經營成本的原因,這從不發生在美國其他任何多形式劇院,所以我們要想一個辦法克服這個.", "en": "So they in the morningwill do something in arena, then they'll do somethingin proscenium and so forth. And so they needed to be ableto quickly transform between different theater organizations, and for operational budget reasons, this actually no longerhappens in pretty much any multi-form theaterin the United States, so we needed to figure outa way to overcome that."}, {"zh-tw": "我們的想法是合理安排劇院把原先定為前面和後面的東西拿出來放成上下結構 - 樓上和樓下創造出一個我們稱為劇院機器的東西.我們把錢花在了建築的運作上.", "en": "So our thought was to literallyput the theater on its head: to take those thingsthat were previously defined as front-of-house and back-of-house and stack them above houseand below house, and to create what we calleda theater machine. We invest the moneyin the operation of the building."}, {"zh-tw": "就好像這個建築可以放在任何地方: 不管你放在哪, 下面的面積用作劇院表演.這使得我們能過回到最基本的原則,重新定義舞台牆,聲光效果,等等.", "en": "It's almost as though the buildingcould be placed anywhere, wherever you place it, the area under it is chargedfor theatrical performances. And it allowed us to go backto first principles, and redefine fly tower, acousticenclosure, light enclosure and so forth."}, {"zh-tw": "按一個按鈕, 藝術總監就可以在台前,舞台, 台中, 地板之間很快的移動.實際上, 我們, 用了運作成本 --不對, 資本成本 -- 我們能獲得運作成本不能獲得的效果.", "en": "And at the push of a button, it allows the artistic directorto move between proscenium, thrust, and in fact, arenaand traverse and flat floor, in a very quick transfiguration. So in fact, usingoperational budget, we can -- sorry, capital cost --we can actually achieve what was no longer achievablein operational cost."}, {"zh-tw": "這意味著現在藝術指導有一個調色板, 她或者他能夠從一系列的形式和隊伍之間選擇,因為劇院中通常的夾在台前和台後的空間被解放出來了.所以藝術指導就能夠展示 --先來一出瓦格納的遊行推出第一幕,再過度到希臘式的場景,第二幕到競技場, 諸如此類.", "en": "And that means that the artistic director now has a palette that he or shecan choose from, between a series of formsand a series of processions, because that enclosure around the theaterthat is normally trapped with front-of-house and back-of-housespaces has been liberated. So an artistic director has the abilityto have a performance that enters in a Wagnerian procession, shows the first act in thrust, the intermission in a Greek procession, second act in arena, and so forth."}, {"zh-tw": "我要向你展示一下 -- 這個實際上是什麼意思.這個是戲院的近觀.", "en": "So I'm going to show youwhat this actually means. This is the theater up close."}, {"zh-tw": "這個戲院的任何一部份都能被分別打開.燈光道具和聲響道具能分別吊起來所以你能演貝克特,而背景是達拉斯.", "en": "Any portion around the theateractually can be opened discretely. The light enclosure can be liftedseparate to the acoustic enclosure, so you can do Beckettwith Dallas as the backdrop."}, {"zh-tw": "每一部分都能打開, 所以現在可以有摩托車直接開進表演中, 或者你甚至可以來一個露天表演,或終場休息.陽台都移到這些設置中間,但都被隱藏起來.", "en": "Portions can be opened, so you can now actually have motorcyclesdrive directly into the performance, or you can even just havean open-air performance, or for intermissions. The balconies all move to gobetween those configurations, but they also disappear."}, {"zh-tw": "前台也可以隱藏起來,你能引進巨大的物件, 所以實際上他們的 --達拉斯劇院 -- 他們的第一場表演將是關於查尔斯林白的一場秀,表演中會用到真正的飛機.", "en": "The proscenium line can also disappear. You can bring enormous objects in, so in fact, the Dallas Theater Company -- their first show will be a playabout Charles Lindbergh, and they'll want to bring ina real aircraft."}, {"zh-tw": "同時,這種設計使得他們, 在淡季時,能夠把場地出租給不同的活動.這是在晚上看起來的樣子 -- 抱歉, 有點距離.", "en": "And then it also provides them,in the off-season, the ability to actually rent outtheir space for entirely different things. This is it from a distance."}, {"zh-tw": "把所有部份都打開來適應不同的活動.在晚上.", "en": "Open up entire portionsfor different kinds of events. And at night."}, {"zh-tw": "把燈光道具移開; 聲響不動.這是一個大型卡車展.", "en": "Again, remove the light enclosure;keep the acoustic enclosure. This is a monster truck show."}, {"zh-tw": "接著我要介紹最後一個項目.這也是一個不同尋常的顧客.", "en": "I'm going to show now the last project. This also is an unusual client."}, {"zh-tw": "他們倒置了整個開發的思想.他們找到我們,說 -- 不像普通開發者 --他們說, \"我們想建一個現代藝術展覽館", "en": "They inverted the whole ideaof development. They came to us and they said --unlike normal developers -- they said, \"We want to start out by providing a contemporaryart museum in Louisville."}, {"zh-tw": "在路易斯威爾. 這是我們主要的目標.\"不是為了有個賺錢的機會,他們想要能夠促進市中心的活動.實際上他們想要這個現代藝術館建成他們的一種樣本所以他們反其道而行.", "en": "That's our main goal.\" And so instead of being a developerthat sees an opportunity to make money, they saw an ability to bea catalyst in their downtown. And the fact that they wanted to supportthe contemporary art museum actually built their pro forma, so they worked in reverse."}, {"zh-tw": "這個樣板引導我們到一個非常巨大的多功能建築它的目標是支持他們對藝術的熱愛,但同時也增加技術與其他商業空間的合作與交互從而吸引更多的藝術家來這裡工作.這還要求我們考慮如何設計一個建築, 即是一個單獨的建築同時也好像是一組建築中的一座.", "en": "And that pro forma led us to a mixed-use buildingthat was very large, in order to supporttheir aspirations of the art, but it also opened up opportunitiesfor the art itself to collaborate, interactwith commercial spaces that actually artists moreand more want to work within. And it also charged uswith thinking about how to have something that was both a single building and a credible sort of sub-building."}, {"zh-tw": "接著我要 -- 這是路易斯维尔地平线 --我要給你們一一介紹完成這個項目的種種限制因素.首先, 物理上的限制. 我們必須", "en": "So this is Louisville's skyline, and I'm going to takeyou through the various constraints that led to the project. First: the physical constraints."}, {"zh-tw": "在三個不同的地點操作,每個地點, 都比這個建築要小很多.我們必須在新的穆罕穆得阿里中心邊上施工並且不能影響它.", "en": "We actually had to operateon three discrete sites, all of them well smallerthan the size of the building. We had to operate next to the newMuhammad Ali Center, and respect it."}, {"zh-tw": "我們必須在這個百年洪泛區施工.現在, 這個地區每年發洪水三到四次,在我們的工地後面有一個泄洪堤和新奧爾良那個壞了的很類似.", "en": "We had to operatewithin the 100-year floodplain. Now, this area floodsthree to four times a year, and there's a levee behind our site, similar to the onesthat broke in New Orleans."}, {"zh-tw": "我們必須在I-64走廊後施工,這是一條從這些不同的地點中穿過的街道.綜合所有這些因素, -- 我們就好像在浴盆中修建一個噩夢的組合體.", "en": "Had to operate behind the I-64 corridor, a street that cuts through the middleof these separate sites. So we're starting to build a sort ofnightmare of constraints in a bathtub."}, {"zh-tw": "在浴缸下面,是城市的主要供電系統.他們還想加一個行人過道來把一系列的文化建築連繫起來,還有加一個觀光通道 -- 因為這是一個歷史性的城區 --他們也不像阻礙新的建築.", "en": "Underneath the bathtubare the city's main power lines. And there is a pedestrian corridorthat they wanted to add, that would link a seriesof cultural buildings, and a view corridor --because this is the historic district -- that they didn't want to obstructwith a new building."}, {"zh-tw": "現在我們要加上1.1百萬平方英尺.如果照傳統做法, 那1.1 百萬平方英尺 --這些是不同的項目 -- 傳統做法就是確認公共元素, 把他們融入施工.現在我們處在一個很糟糕的處境:一個公共的建築在一個漲水的盆地中間.", "en": "And now we're going to add1.1 million square feet. And if we did the traditional thing,that 1.1 million square feet -- these are the different programs -- the traditional thing would be to identifythe public elements, place them on sites, and now we'd have a reallyterrible situation: a public thing in the middleof a bathtub that floods."}, {"zh-tw": "接著我們來看看所有其他的因素 --不同的商業因素:賓館, 豪華住宅, 辦公場地, 等等 ---全都要放進來. 我們將創造一個根本不可能行的通的東西.", "en": "And then we would sizeall the other elements -- the different commercial elements: hotel, luxury housing,offices and so forth -- and dump it on top. And we would createsomething that was unviable."}, {"zh-tw": "實際上 -- 你知道的 -- 這就是被稱作時代華納大樓的東西.我們的方法很簡單.", "en": "In fact -- and you know this -- thisis called the Time Warner Building. So our strategy was very simple."}, {"zh-tw": "就是把整個街區升起來,重組一些元素好讓它們有適當的風景,同時也和市中心有適當的聯繫,然後再連接道路.這就是基本概念.現在我來展示一下這個概念生成了什麼樣的作品.", "en": "Just lift the entire block, flip some of the elements over, reposition themso they have appropriate views and relationships to downtown, and make circulation connectionsand reroute the road. So that's the basic concept, and now I'm going to show youwhat it leads to."}, {"zh-tw": "它看上去是非常正式, 任性而為,但卻是完全符合所有的限制因素.在我們揭幕時, 大家有點緊張因為這是建築師發表一個聲明,而不是企圖解決一系列問題.", "en": "Ok, it seems a very formal,willful gesture, but something derived entirelyout of the constraints. And again, when we unveiled it,there was a sort of nervousness that this was about an architectmaking a statement, not an architect who was attemptingto solve a series of problems."}, {"zh-tw": "現在, 在那個中心區, 如我所說的,我們能把一系列東西混合起來.所以這裡你能看到的是這些 --有點像x射線 -- 這些高樓", "en": "Now, within that center zone, as I said, we have the ability to mixa series of things. So here, this is sort of an x-ray -- the towers are totally developer-driven."}, {"zh-tw": "完全是按開發商的意願建的. 他們告訴我們尺寸大小等等我們就將注意力集中在所有的公共部分 --大廳, 酒吧,所有不同的商業元素共同具有的東西 --把它們結合在中央, 有點像地鐵地圖,在過渡區包括進這個現代藝術展覽館.這就形成了這個佈局,可以讓藝術家們從他們的工作室看到22層樓的景觀,同時展覽館館長也能方便地開放或關閉展覽館.", "en": "They told us the dimensions,the sizes and so forth, and we focused on takingall the public components -- the lobbies, the bars -- everything that different commercialelements would have, and combined it in the center,in the sort of subway map, in the transfer zone that would alsoinclude the contemporary art museum. So it creates a situation like this,where you have artists who can operate within an art space that also hasan amazing view on the 22nd floor, but it also has proximity that the curatorcan either open or close."}, {"zh-tw": "人們看得見騎自行車鍛鍊的人們,而騎車的人也可以瀏覽藝術作品, 等等.這也意味著, 如果藝術家想要選擇游泳池,他們能在游泳池開個畫展,而不需要總是局限於展覽館的空間.", "en": "It allows peopleon exercise bicycles to be seen, or to see the art, and so forth. It also means that if an artist wantsto invade something like a swimming pool, they can begin to do their exhibitionin a swimming pool, so they're not forced to alwayswork within the confines of a contemporary gallery space."}, {"zh-tw": "那麼這個怎麼建呢.非常簡單: 這是一個椅子.", "en": "So, how to build this. It's very simple: it's a chair."}, {"zh-tw": "先建核心部分.在修建核心部分的同時, 我們在同一層面上修建現代展覽館.", "en": "So, we begin by building the cores.
