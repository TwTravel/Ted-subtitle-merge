It's about who we are, and I can't help but be curious."}, {"zh-tw": "這是什麽迷呢？是這两者的關係：你的大腦和你的有意識的體驗。例如你嘗到巧克力味道的體驗或天鹅绒的手感。這個迷倒不是新的。早在1868年，Thomas Huxley 寫到：\"爲啥一些妙不可言的東西如人的清醒意識其形成竟是來自刺激性神經組織，實在莫名其妙，跟阿拉丁擦擦他的油燈精靈就出現了一樣無法解釋\"。Huxley熟知大腦的活動和有意識體驗是有關係的，他衹是不知道原因是何。", "en": "The mystery is this: What is the relationshipbetween your brain and your conscious experiences, such as your experienceof the taste of chocolate or the feeling of velvet? Now, this mystery is not new. In 1868, Thomas Huxley wrote, \"How it is that anything so remarkableas a state of consciousness comes about as the result of irritating nervous tissue is just as unaccountable as the appearance of the geniewhen Aladdin rubbed his lamp.\" Now, Huxley knew that brain activity and conscious experiences are correlated, but he didn't know why."}, {"zh-tw": "在其時代的科學界裡這是個迷。Huxley之後的這些年，科學界對大腦活動有了很多的發現。但是兩者的關係即大腦活動和有意識的體驗仍然是個迷。", "en": "To the science of his day,it was a mystery. In the years since Huxley, science has learned a lotabout brain activity, but the relationshipbetween brain activity and conscious experiencesis still a mystery."}, {"zh-tw": "爲何？爲何我們還未搞懂多少這個迷？有專家認爲這迷是解不了的了因我們缺乏必要的概念和智慧。我們不指望猴子去排解量子力學的問題，同樣，我們也不能指望自己的物種去化解這個迷。", "en": "Why? Why have we made so little progress? Well, some experts thinkthat we can't solve this problem because we lack the necessaryconcepts and intelligence. We don't expect monkeys to solveproblems in quantum mechanics, and as it happens, we can't expectour species to solve this problem either."}, {"zh-tw": "我不同意這説法。我樂觀多了。我認爲我們衹是用了個錯誤的假設而已。", "en": "Well, I disagree. I'm more optimistic. I think we've simplymade a false assumption."}, {"zh-tw": "糾正了假設後，我們很可能就能把這迷解了。今天，我想和大家說一下這個假設是什麽，爲何它是錯誤的，我們可以怎樣加以糾正。", "en": "Once we fix it, we justmight solve this problem. Today, I'd like tell youwhat that assumption is, why it's false, and how to fix it."}, {"zh-tw": "先來個問題：我們眼睛看見的，是現實的真貌嗎？我睜大雙眼就有這體驗：一公尺外有個紅色的番茄。結果是，我相信在現實中，有個紅色的番茄在一公尺之外。", "en": "Let's begin with a question: Do we see reality as it is? I open my eyes and I have an experience that I describeas a red tomato a meter away. As a result, I come to believethat in reality, there's a red tomato a meter away."}, {"zh-tw": "然後我閉上雙眼，我的體驗就變了是一片灰色的面了。這意味著在現實中，仍有這麽一個紅番茄在一公尺之外嗎？是的。但這念頭會不會是錯的呢？會不會我錯誤地詮釋了知覺的實質呢？我們有過錯誤地詮釋了知覺的先例。我們曾以爲地球是扁的，以爲它看起來就是扁的。", "en": "I then close my eyes, and my experiencechanges to a gray field, but is it still the case that in reality,there's a red tomato a meter away? I think so, but could I be wrong? Could I be misinterpretingthe nature of my perceptions? We have misinterpretedour perceptions before. We used to think the Earth is flat,because it looks that way."}, {"zh-tw": "Pythagorus發現我們相錯了。然後我們又以爲地球是宇宙的固定的中心。也是因爲當時看來就那樣。", "en": "Pythagorus discovered that we were wrong. Then we thought that the Earthis the unmoving center of the Universe, again because it looks that way."}, {"zh-tw": "Copernicus 和 Galileo 再次發現我們又錯了。Galileo 接著琢磨是否我們錯誤地詮釋了自己的體驗，在其他方面出錯了。", "en": "Copernicus and Galileo discovered,again, that we were wrong. Galileo then wondered if we mightbe misinterpreting our experiences in other ways."}, {"zh-tw": "他寫到：\"我認爲味道、氣味、顔色等等是存在於意識當中的。正是如此，如果活體沒有了，所有這些特質也會化爲烏有了。\"這可是個大膽的斷言。", "en": "He wrote: \"I think that tastes,odors, colors, and so on reside in consciousness. Hence if the living creature were removed,all these qualities would be annihilated.\" Now, that's a stunning claim."}, {"zh-tw": "Galileo會不會是對的呢？我們會不會真的非常錯誤地詮釋自己的體驗呢？當今的科學研究能對此有什麽看法呢？神經科學們說我們的大腦的三分之一都有用在視覺上面。我們衹要單單地睜開眼睛環視一下這講座間，數億神經元和數萬億突觸就已經被用上了。", "en": "Could Galileo be right? Could we really be misinterpretingour experiences that badly? What does modern sciencehave to say about this? Well, neuroscientists tell usthat about a third of the brain's cortex is engaged in vision. When you simply open your eyesand look about this room, billions of neuronsand trillions of synapses are engaged."}, {"zh-tw": "這稍微有點意想不到。因爲衹從視覺這點來説，我們衹把當作是照相機。它拍個照把現實客觀地呈現出來。", "en": "Now, this is a bit surprising, because to the extent thatwe think about vision at all, we think of it as like a camera. It just takes a pictureof objective reality as it is."}, {"zh-tw": "我們視覺的一部分確實像一照相機：眼睛有個晶體能調焦把物像聚焦到眼睛後部。後部有1億3千萬個光感受器，因此我們的眼睛就像個1億3千萬像素的攝影機。但是這個解釋不了數億神經元和數萬億突觸在視覺上到底起什麽作用。", "en": "Now, there is a part of visionthat's like a camera: the eye has a lens that focusesan image on the back of the eye where there are 130 millionphotoreceptors, so the eye is like a 130-megapixel camera. But that doesn't explainthe billions of neurons and trillions of synapsesthat are engaged in vision."}, {"zh-tw": "這些神經元到底在做什麽呢？神經科學家們說它們在實時地生造我們正目睹著的各種形狀、物體、顔色和行進中的東西。就像是我們衹是在如實地抓拍這個房間。但事實是，我們看見的所有東西都是構建出來的。", "en": "What are these neurons up to? Well, neuroscientists tell usthat they are creating, in real time, all the shapes, objects, colors,and motions that we see. It feels like we're just taking a snapshotof this room the way it is, but in fact, we're constructingeverything that we see."}, {"zh-tw": "我們不是一次性地構建整個物界。我們衹在需要的當時一刻構建。", "en": "We don't constructthe whole world at once. We construct what we need in the moment."}, {"zh-tw": "有很多演示可以非常有力地驗證我們看見的東西都是構造出來的。我做兩個演示給大家看看。", "en": "Now, there are many demonstrationsthat are quite compelling that we construct what we see. I'll just show you two."}, {"zh-tw": "演示一，你看見些紅色的圓形每個都有缺口的。如果我把這些圓形稍微轉動一下，馬上，你看見的是個立體方塊從螢幕上脫穎而出。別忘了，這螢幕是平的哦。所以你體驗到的這個三度空間方塊一定是你構造出來的。", "en": "In this example, you see some red discswith bits cut out of them, but if I just rotatethe disks a little bit, suddenly, you see a 3D cubepop out of the screen. Now, the screen of course is flat, so the three-dimensional cubethat you're experiencing must be your construction."}, {"zh-tw": "演示二，你看見些發光的藍條子邊邊挺鋒利的，不停地在一個很多點的面上移動。事實上呢，那些點沒動過。", "en": "In this next example, you see glowing blue barswith pretty sharp edges moving across a field of dots. In fact, no dots move."}, {"zh-tw": "我衹是一帧一帧地轉換小點的顔色從藍轉成黑，或從黑轉成藍。當我轉得快的時候，你的視覺系統就生造了發光的藍條子，邊邊挺鋒利的，不斷行進著。", "en": "All I'm doing from frame to frameis changing the colors of dots from blue to black or black to blue. But when I do this quickly, your visual system createsthe glowing blue bars with the sharp edges and the motion."}, {"zh-tw": "有很多這樣的例子的。這裏衹是兩個演示了你在構建所見東西。神經科學家們還說了更進一步的。", "en": "There are many more examples,but these are just two that you construct what you see. But neuroscientists go further."}, {"zh-tw": "他們說我們重新構建了現實。當我有一項可以被説成是紅色的番茄的體驗時這體驗其實是你如實地構建了一個真的紅色番茄的屬性，即使我不看著的時候它也存在的屬性。", "en": "They say that we reconstruct reality. So, when I have an experiencethat I describe as a red tomato, that experience is actuallyan accurate reconstruction of the properties of a real red tomato that would existeven if I weren't looking."}, {"zh-tw": "現在要問了，爲何神經科學家說我們不單衹構建，我們還重新構建？標準論點都是屬於進化理論的。我們的祖先當中誰視力更精確誰就比視力沒那麽精確的更有競爭優勢，於是他們有更大機會傳宗接代。", "en": "Now, why would neuroscientistssay that we don't just construct, we reconstruct? Well, the standard argument given is usually an evolutionary one. Those of our ancestorswho saw more accurately had a competitive advantage comparedto those who saw less accurately, and therefore they were more likelyto pass on their genes."}, {"zh-tw": "我們是那些視力更精確的祖先的後代，故可以很有信心地相信在正常情況下，我們的知覺是精確的。這個在標準課本都能看到。", "en": "We are the offspring of thosewho saw more accurately, and so we can be confident that,in the normal case, our perceptions are accurate. You see this in the standard textbooks."}, {"zh-tw": "例如有本課本說：\"從進化角度說，視覺有用恰恰是因爲它精確無疑。“即是說，精確的知覺是更優良的知覺。它能給你生存的優勢。", "en": "One textbook says, for example, \"Evolutionarily speaking, vision is useful preciselybecause it is so accurate.\" So the idea is that accurate perceptionsare fitter perceptions. They give you a survival advantage."}, {"zh-tw": "問題是，這説法正確嗎？是對進化理論的正確的詮釋嗎？我們可以先看看兩個自然界的例子。澳洲的珠甲蟲樣子帶點、帶亮澤、呈棕色。", "en": "Now, is this correct? Is this the right interpretationof evolutionary theory? Well, let's first look at a coupleof examples in nature. The Australian jewel beetle is dimpled, glossy and brown."}, {"zh-tw": "雌性的不能飛。雄性的能飛、四處尋找魅力無限的雌蟲。", "en": "The female is flightless. The male flies, looking,of course, for a hot female."}, {"zh-tw": "每找到一隻，牠就騎其上，與之交配。在荒野上還有另一個物種，叫智人類。", "en": "When he finds one, he alights and mates. There's another species in the outback, Homo sapiens."}, {"zh-tw": "這物種的男性腦袋奇大，都用在四處找冰鎮啤酒的功夫上了。每找到一瓶他就喝一瓶，有時喝完就把瓶子撩荒野上了。", "en": "The male of this specieshas a massive brain that he uses to hunt for cold beer. And when he finds one, he drains it, and sometimes throws the bottleinto the outback."}, {"zh-tw": "無巧不成書，這些瓶子也是樣子帶點、帶亮澤、而棕色的色度也剛好能讓這些珠甲蟲幻想連天的。雄甲蟲見啤酒瓶就騎上上下下要與之交配。", "en": "Now, as it happens, these bottlesare dimpled, glossy, and just the right shade of brownto tickle the fancy of these beetles. The males swarm all overthe bottles trying to mate."}, {"zh-tw": "如是，牠們對真格的雌蟲倒沒丁點兒興趣了。典型的雄性爲了酒瓶疏遠了雌性的案例。", "en": "They lose all interestin the real females. Classic case of the maleleaving the female for the bottle."}, {"zh-tw": "該物種幾乎絕種。澳洲得把瓶子改了才挽救了珠甲蟲。", "en": "The species almost went extinct. Australia had to change its bottlesto save its beetles."}, {"zh-tw": "那些雄蟲幾千年來都能準確無誤的找到雌蟲，很可能幾百萬年都如此。似乎牠們見到的就是現實的本貌。很顯然，事實並不如此。", "en": "Now, the males had successfullyfound females for thousands, perhaps millions of years. It looked like they saw realityas it is, but apparently not."}, {"zh-tw": "進化讓牠們習得的是一項行技而已。雌甲蟲就是帶點的、帶亮澤的、呈棕色、越大越好。", "en": "Evolution had given them a hack. A female is anything dimpled,glossy and brown, the bigger the better."}, {"zh-tw": "哪怕把整個啤酒瓶都爬完了，那雄蟲就是沒法知道自己錯那兒。也許你會說，甲蟲嘛，當然啦，簡單低等，哺乳動物肯定不會。", "en": "Even when crawling all over the bottle,the male couldn't discover his mistake. Now, you might say, beetles, sure,they're very simple creatures, but surely not mammals."}, {"zh-tw": "哺乳動物不需依賴伎倆。這我就不多説了，你們懂的。", "en": "Mammals don't rely on tricks. Well, I won't dwell on this,but you get the idea."}, {"zh-tw": "因此這就引出一重要的技術上的問題：自然篩選真的偏袒所見如實嗎？幸好，我們無需揮舞雙手東猜西猜；進化論是一項數學根據精確的理論。我們可以用進化等式來探究一下。", "en": "So this raises an importanttechnical question: Does natural selection really favorseeing reality as it is? Fortunately, we don't haveto wave our hands and guess; evolution is a mathematicallyprecise theory. We can use the equations of evolutionto check this out."}, {"zh-tw": "我們可以把不同生物放到放到多個人造物界裏競爭，看看誰生存下來，誰茁壯成長，哪一個感官系統更優良。這裏面各個等式中最關鍵的元素是體良。", "en": "We can have various organismsin artificial worlds compete and see which survive and which thrive, which sensory systems are more fit. A key notion in thoseequations is fitness."}, {"zh-tw": "看看這枚牛排：對於某動物的體良來説這牛排起什麽作用？對於一隻正在尋食的獅子來説，它能促進體良。對於一喫飽了的、衹想交配的獅子呢，它不會促進體良。", "en": "Consider this steak: What does this steak dofor the fitness of an animal? Well, for a hungry lion looking to eat,it enhances fitness. For a well-fed lion looking to mate,it doesn't enhance fitness."}, {"zh-tw": "對於一隻任何狀態下的兔子來説呢，它不促進體良。如此，體良是有賴於所見如實，對的，但同時也有賴於有機體本身、其狀態及行動。體良和能見現實真貌不是一碼事。是體良，而不是現實真貌，占據了進化論等式的中心位置。", "en": "And for a rabbit in any state,it doesn't enhance fitness, so fitness does dependon reality as it is, yes, but also on the organism,its state and its action. Fitness is not the same thingas reality as it is, and it's fitness,and not reality as it is, that figures centrallyin the equations of evolution."}, {"zh-tw": "在我的實驗室裏，我們操運過成百上千個進化游戲模擬，配有衆多不同的隨機選出的物界，各物界裏各種有機體進行競爭，占獲資源。一部分有機體能看見全部物界的真貌，其他有機體則衹看到現實的一部分，還有的對現實的真貌熟視無睹，衹看見體良一樣東西。", "en": "So, in my lab, we have run hundreds of thousandsof evolutionary game simulations with lots of differentrandomly chosen worlds and organisms that competefor resources in those worlds. Some of the organismssee all of the reality, others see just part of the reality, and some see none of the reality, only fitness."}, {"zh-tw": "誰贏了呢?説來你也許不信，能看見現實真貌的都絕種了。在每一個模擬中，對現實熟視無睹的，衹單單看到體良的那些有機體把能看到現實真貌的有機體都趕到絕種了。", "en": "Who wins? Well, I hate to break it to you,but perception of reality goes extinct. In almost every simulation, organisms that see none of reality but are just tuned to fitness drive to extinction all the organismsthat perceive reality as it is."}, {"zh-tw": "説到底，進化既不眷顧高低向知覺，也不眷顧精密知覺。能看得見現實真貌的都絕種了。", "en": "So the bottom line is, evolutiondoes not favor veridical, or accurate perceptions. Those perceptions of reality go extinct."}, {"zh-tw": "好吧，這觀察有點驚人。不能精確看到現實真貌爲何能使我們有生存的優勢？這有點反直覺。", "en": "Now, this is a bit stunning. How can it be that not seeingthe world accurately gives us a survival advantage? That is a bit counterintuitive."}, {"zh-tw": "但別忘了剛才講到的珠甲蟲。珠甲蟲幾千年，可能幾百萬年都活下來了，靠的是簡單的片長薄技。", "en": "But remember the jewel beetle. The jewel beetle survivedfor thousands, perhaps millions of years, using simple tricks and hacks."}, {"zh-tw": "進化制衡向我們顯示的是所有的有機體，包括我們，和珠甲蟲面對的是一樣的。我們看見的不是現實的真貌。", "en": "What the equationsof evolution are telling us is that all organisms, including us, are in the same boat as the jewel beetle. We do not see reality as it is."}, {"zh-tw": "我們是由那些讓我們活下來的片長薄技塑造出來的。當然，我們也需要依靠直覺的某些幫助。", "en": "We're shaped with tricksand hacks that keep us alive. Still, we need some help with our intuitions."}, {"zh-tw": "爲何不看見現實的真貌會如此有用呢？很慶幸，我們有個非常得力的比方：你電腦上的桌面界面。我們來看那個代表你正在寫的TED Talk稿子的藍色的圖標。", "en": "How can not perceivingreality as it is be useful? Well, fortunately, we havea very helpful metaphor: the desktop interface on your computer. Consider that blue iconfor a TED Talk that you're writing."}, {"zh-tw": "圖標是藍色的，成矩形處在桌面的右下角。這意味著電腦裏面的文字文件就是藍色的、矩形的、就處在電腦裏的右手邊角落嗎？當然不是。", "en": "Now, the icon is blue and rectangular and in the lower right cornerof the desktop. Does that mean that the text file itselfin the computer is blue, rectangular, and in the lowerright-hand corner of the computer? Of course not."}, {"zh-tw": "誰要是認爲是的話，就是誤釋了界面的目的了。界面的目的不是向你呈現電腦的真貌。", "en": "Anyone who thought that misinterpretsthe purpose of the interface. It's not there to show youthe reality of the computer."}, {"zh-tw": "事實是，界面是爲你遮蓋電腦的真貌。你並不想知道二極管、電阻器、軟件的兆字節之類的。", "en": "In fact, it's there to hide that reality. You don't want to know about the diodes and resistors and allthe megabytes of software."}, {"zh-tw": "要是得跟這些打交道的話，你永遠也沒法寫作文件，或編輯圖片了。這樣説來，進化給我們有個界面的意義是把現實的真貌隱藏起來，並指引適應性行爲。", "en": "If you had to deal with that,you could never write your text file or edit your photo. So the idea is that evolutionhas given us an interface that hides reality and guidesadaptive behavior."}, {"zh-tw": "你目前知覺到的空間和時間，就如同你的電腦桌面。實質物體也就衹不過是桌面的圖標而已。", "en": "Space and time, as youperceive them right now, are your desktop. Physical objects are simply iconsin that desktop."}, {"zh-tw": "有個顯而易見的反駁。Hoffman, 如果你認爲對面開來那輛時速200英里的火車衹不過是電腦桌面的圖標，不見你一躍而上擋前面去？等你沒命了，和你的理論一起埋了，我們就知道那輛火車不單單衹是圖標了。", "en": "There's an obvious objection. Hoffman, if you think that traincoming down the track at 200 MPH is just an icon of your desktop, why don't you step in front of it? And after you're gone,and your theory with you, we'll know that there's moreto that train than just an icon."}, {"zh-tw": "呵，我不會上去擋著那火車，正猶如我不會掉以輕心地把那圖標拖到回收站。倒不是因爲我把那個圖標當成是實物文檔----那份文件並非真的是藍色的、或矩形的 ----而是我會鄭重對待那個圖標。否則我會丟失一個星期工作的内容。", "en": "Well, I wouldn't stepin front of that train for the same reason that I wouldn't carelessly dragthat icon to the trash can: not because I take the icon literally -- the file is not literally blueor rectangular -- but I do take it seriously. I could lose weeks of work."}, {"zh-tw": "同樣地，進化把我們塑造成能正確對待知覺上的代符的人以得以生存下來。所以我們最好不要對其掉以輕心。", "en": "Similarly, evolution has shaped us with perceptual symbolsthat are designed to keep us alive. We'd better take them seriously."}, {"zh-tw": "看見蛇了，別撿起來。看見懸崖了，別往下跳。", "en": "If you see a snake, don't pick it up. If you see a cliff, don't jump off."}, {"zh-tw": "這些都是爲了我們的安全，我們應該慎重其事。這不意味著我們應該把代符與事物等同起來。", "en": "They're designed to keep us safe,and we should take them seriously. That does not mean that weshould take them literally."}, {"zh-tw": "否則就犯邏輯錯誤了。另外一個反駁：你説的也不是什麽新發現。", "en": "That's a logical error. Another objection: There'snothing really new here."}, {"zh-tw": "物理學家們很早前就說那輛火車的鐵皮看起來堅實，實質是大體積空間裡有很多微觀粒子繞一起罷了。不是什麽新發現。", "en": "Physicists have told us for a long timethat the metal of that train looks solid but really it's mostly empty spacewith microscopic particles zipping around. There's nothing new here."}, {"zh-tw": "呵，不全對。這等於說，我知道那電腦裏面的藍色圖標不是電腦的真實面貌，如果我用個精確放大鏡好好地靠近看清楚，我會看見細小的像素，那就是電腦的真貌啊。", "en": "Well, not exactly. It's like saying, I know thatthat blue icon on the desktop is not the reality of the computer, but if I pull out my trustymagnifying glass and look really closely, I see little pixels, and that's the reality of the computer."}, {"zh-tw": "呵，也不全對。你仍舊沒離開桌面本身。此爲問題的中心點了。那些微觀粒子仍然存在於空間和時間裏面：它們仍舊在用戶的界面。", "en": "Well, not really -- you're stillon the desktop, and that's the point. Those microscopic particlesare still in space and time: they're still in the user interface."}, {"zh-tw": "而我在說的比物理學家們說的有更大顛覆性。最後一個反駁：我們大家都看見那輛火車，那火車不是我們當中任一位構建出來的。", "en": "So I'm saying something far more radicalthan those physicists. Finally, you might object, look, we all see the train, therefore none of us constructs the train."}, {"zh-tw": "不過，還記得這例子吧。這裏，我們都看見一立體方塊，但螢幕是平的。因此你看見的方塊是你構建出來的。", "en": "But remember this example. In this example, we all see a cube, but the screen is flat, so the cube that you seeis the cube that you construct."}, {"zh-tw": "我們都看見一個方塊。因爲這方塊是我們，每一個人，構建出來的。這跟我們建構了那輛火車是一樣的。", "en": "We all see a cube because we all, each one of us,constructs the cube that we see. The same is true of the train."}, {"zh-tw": "我們都看見一兩火車，因爲我們每位都看見自己構建出來的火車。我們看見的所有物理實體都緣於這個道理。我們都傾向於認爲知覺就像個窗口，從那能看到現實的真貌。", "en": "We all see a train becausewe each see the train that we construct, and the same is trueof all physical objects. We're inclined to think that perceptionis like a window on reality as it is."}, {"zh-tw": "而進化的理論告訴我們那是錯誤地詮釋了我們的知覺。其實，現實更如同是個3D的桌面，目的是把現實的複雜性遮蓋起來，同時爲我們的適應性行爲做指引。", "en": "The theory of evolution is telling usthat this is an incorrect interpretation of our perceptions. Instead, reality is more like a 3D desktop that's designed to hidethe complexity of the real world and guide adaptive behavior."}, {"zh-tw": "你目睹的空間就是你的桌面。物理實體是桌面上的圖標。", "en": "Space as you perceive it is your desktop. Physical objects are justthe icons in that desktop."}, {"zh-tw": "我們以前認爲地球是扁的，因爲看起來是扁的。我們又曾認爲地球是現實世界的不移的中心，因爲看起來如此。", "en": "We used to think that the Earth is flatbecause it looks that way. Then we thought that the Earthis the unmoving center of reality because it looks that way."}, {"zh-tw": "我們都錯了。我們都曾經錯誤地詮釋過我們的知覺。", "en": "We were wrong. We had misinterpreted our perceptions."}, {"zh-tw": "現在呢，我們認爲時空和物體就是現實界的真貌。進化的理論再次告訴我們我們又錯了。", "en": "Now we believe that spacetime and objects are the nature of reality as it is. The theory of evolution is telling usthat once again, we're wrong."}, {"zh-tw": "我們錯誤地詮釋了知覺體驗的内容。世上有些東西是你不看著也一樣存在的，不過不是時空和物理實體。", "en": "We're misinterpreting the contentof our perceptual experiences. There's something that existswhen you don't look, but it's not spacetimeand physical objects."}, {"zh-tw": "我們老繞不過時空和物體。如同那些珠甲蟲繞不過自己看上的啤酒瓶。爲何繞不過？我們看見自己的看不見自己的盲點。", "en": "It's as hard for us to let goof spacetime and objects as it is for the jewel beetleto let go of its bottle. Why? Because we're blindto our own blindnesses."}, {"zh-tw": "然而，相比於珠甲蟲，我們有個優勢：即我們的科學和技術。透過望遠鏡，我們發現地球不是現實的不移中心。透過進化理論的望遠鏡，我們發現時空和物體不是現實的實質。", "en": "But we have an advantageover the jewel beetle: our science and technology. By peering through the lens of a telescope we discovered that the Earthis not the unmoving center of reality, and by peering through the lensof the theory of evolution we discovered that spacetime and objects are not the nature of reality."}, {"zh-tw": "當我有被描述爲一個紅番茄這樣知覺體驗時，我是在和現實活動。但現實不是那個紅番茄，也和紅番茄沒有絲毫相似之處。同樣地，當我有一個被描述爲獅子或牛排的體驗時，我是在和現實互動。但現實不是獅子或牛排。", "en": "When I have a perceptual experiencethat I describe as a red tomato, I am interacting with reality, but that reality is not a red tomatoand is nothing like a red tomato.

And that reality, whatever it is, is the real source of cause and effect in the world -- not brains, not neurons."}, {"zh-tw": "大腦和神經元沒有導因之力。兩者都不是導致我們知覺體驗的根源，也不導致我們行爲的根源。", "en": "Brains and neuronshave no causal powers. They cause none of ourperceptual experiences, and none of our behavior."}, {"zh-tw": "大腦和神經元是物種各自獨特的代符，一種符術。那麽，對於人意識的這個迷，這結論意味著什麽呢？意味著多個新的可能性。", "en": "Brains and neurons are a species-specificset of symbols, a hack. What does this meanfor the mystery of consciousness?

I doubt this, but it's worth exploring."}, {"zh-tw": "現實可能是某種龐大的、相互間互動的意識代理體的網絡，有簡單的有複雜的，在導致各自之間的意識體驗。聽起來荒誕，但事實上並不如此。這是我目前正在探索的。", "en": "Perhaps reality is some vast,interacting network of conscious agents, simple and complex, that causeeach other's conscious experiences. Actually, this isn't as crazyan idea as it seems, and I'm currently exploring it."}, {"zh-tw": "論點在這：一旦我們離棄由完全憑直覺的但萬分虛假的慣想構成的所謂現實真貌，就能開拓很多嶄新的探討生命最深奧的迷的方式方法。我打賭，現實一定會是一個更引人入勝的、更出乎意料的東西，完全超乎我們的想象的。", "en": "But here's the point: Once we let go of our massively intuitive but massively false assumptionabout the nature of reality, it opens up new ways to thinkabout life's greatest mystery.

I mean, first of all, some peoplemay just be profoundly depressed at the thought that,if evolution does not favor reality, I mean, doesn't that to some extentundermine all our endeavors here, all our ability to thinkthat we can think the truth, possibly even includingyour own theory, if you go there?
