Proudly, I said: \"An artist.\" \"No, you don't,\" he said, \"You can't make a living being an artist!\" My little seven-year-oldPicasso dreams were crushed."}, {"zh-tw": "但我打起精神，前往尋找另一個新的夢想，最後確定想當一位科學家，看會不會成為下一個愛因斯坦。我一直很喜歡數學及科學，長大後，喜歡寫程式。", "en": "But I gathered myself, went off in search of a new dream, eventually settling on being a scientist, perhaps something likethe next Albert Einstein. I have always loved math and science, later, coding."}, {"zh-tw": "所以我決定要在大學裡研究電腦程式設計。在我大三的時候，我的電腦繪圖教授，展示了一段很棒的短片給我們看。", "en": "And so I decided to studycomputer programming in college. In my junior year, my computer graphics professorshowed us these wonderful short films."}, {"zh-tw": "它是第一部電腦動畫，我們以前都沒見過。我看著這些影片，發呆驚訝，我的腦袋裡開始顫放煙火，並想著，「這就是我這一生一直想做的事啊！」所有我學到的數學、科學、程式語言設計終於可以整合在一起來創造這些世界與人物，以及與我相連結的故事，這對我來說，簡直是太棒了。", "en": "It was the first computer animationany of us had ever seen. I watched these filmsin wonder, transfixed, fireworks going off in my head, thinking, \"That is whatI want to do with my life.\" The idea that all the math, scienceand code I had been learning could come together to createthese worlds and characters and stories I connected with, was pure magic for me."}, {"zh-tw": "兩年後，我開始在這些影片的製作公司工作，「皮克斯動畫工作室」。在那裏我學會了如何真正地執行製作這些影片。", "en": "Just two years later, I started working at the place that made those films,Pixar Animation Studios. It was here I learned howwe actually execute those films."}, {"zh-tw": "為了創作出我們的電影，我們在電腦裡面，創造了一個3D世界。我們從一個點，連成了線，把線連成了一個面，從角色製作、到樹、石頭，最後變成了森林。", "en": "To create our movies, we create a three-dimensionalworld inside the computer. We start with a point that makesa line that makes a face that creates characters, or trees and rocksthat eventually become a forest."}, {"zh-tw": "因為它是3D的世界，我們可以在裡面任意移動我們的攝影機。我被這一切深深吸引了。", "en": "And because it'sa three-dimensional world, we can move a cameraaround inside that world. I was fascinated by all of it."}, {"zh-tw": "之後我第一次嘗試到「打光」的樂趣，「打光」在實務上，就是把燈設置到這個3D的世界。", "en": "But then I got my first taste of lighting. Lighting in practice is placing lightsinside this three-dimensional world."}, {"zh-tw": "我實際上在這裡面到處都有移動的光標。你可以在這裡看到，我已經加了一個燈，我打開了軟體裡面粗糙版本的光，打開陰影效果，放置了燈光。", "en": "I actually have icons of lightsI move around in there. Here you can see I've added a light, I'm turning on the rough versionof lighting in our software, turn on shadows and placing the light."}, {"zh-tw": "當我打光上去後，我就要想，它在真實世界裡會如何呈現 ，並同時要兼顧到美學及故事的需要。所以，它一開始也許是長這樣，但當我們這邊調整一下，那邊移動一下，工作幾個禮拜後，初步的版本也許就像這樣，", "en": "As I place a light, I think about what it mightlook like in real life, but balance that out with what we needartistically and for the story. So it might look like this at first, but as we adjust this and move that in weeks of work, in rough form it might look like this, and in final form, like this."}, {"zh-tw": "最後的版本就會是這樣。就是這種打光的時刻，讓我深深地愛上了它。我們會從這樣的狀況，變成這樣的狀況。", "en": "There's this moment in lightingthat made me fall utterly in love with it. It's where we go from this to this."}, {"zh-tw": "當這些瑣碎的片段結合在一起的時刻，整個世界就好像活躍了起來，彷彿是一個實際存在的地方。這種感動的時刻永遠不會老去，尤其對一個七歲就想當一位藝術家的小女生來說。", "en": "It's the moment whereall the pieces come together, and suddenly the world comes to life as if it's an actual place that exists. This moment never gets old, especially for that little seven-year-oldgirl that wanted to be an artist."}, {"zh-tw": "在學習燈光照明的歷程，我學會了用光來協助故事的描述，用光來設定一天的時間、用光創造出情緒、用光來引導觀眾的視線、學會了如何使一個角色看起來更動人或在一個繁忙的場景裡凸顯他的存在。各位有看到瓦力嗎？他在這裡。", "en": "As I learned to light, I learned about using lightto help tell story, to set the time of day, to create the mood, to guide the audience's eye, how to make a character look appealing or stand out in a busy set. Did you see WALL-E? There he is."}, {"zh-tw": "就如各位所看到的，我們可以在電腦裡面，創造出我們想要的世界。我們可以創造出怪物的世界、陷入愛河的機器人，我們甚至會讓豬飛起來。", "en": "As you can see, we can create any world that we wantinside the computer. We can make a world with monsters, with robots that fall in love, we can even make pigs fly."}, {"zh-tw": "這個美崙美奐的東西，這個不受拘束的藝術自由，它會創造出混亂、它會創造出難以置信的世界、難以置信的變化、一些會讓觀眾不安的東西。", "en": "While this is an incredible thing, this untethered artistic freedom, it can create chaos. It can create unbelievable worlds, unbelievable movement, things that are jarring to the audience."}, {"zh-tw": "所以為了解決這些事情，我們用科學約束我們自己。我們利用所知的科學及世界作為我們的骨幹，來為我們自己的作品打下深入人心及具有辨識性的基礎。", "en": "So to combat this, we tetherourselves with science. We use science and the world we know as a backbone, to ground ourselves in somethingrelatable and recognizable."}, {"zh-tw": "「海底總動員」就是一個很好的例子。電影大部分的場景都在水底下。", "en": "\"Finding Nemo\" is an excellentexample of this. A major portion of the movietakes place underwater."}, {"zh-tw": "但你要如何讓它看起來是在水底下？在早期的研究與發展中，我們會拿出一段水底下的連續鏡頭影片，並把該場景從電腦裡面重製出來。我們會把它拆解開來，看看水底下的場景是由那些元素所構成。", "en": "But how do you make it look underwater? In early research and development, we took a clip of underwater footageand recreated it in the computer. Then we broke it back down to see which elements make upthat underwater look."}, {"zh-tw": "其中一個最關鍵的元素就是：「光線」是如何在水中運行穿越的。所以，我們程式設計出一個可以模擬這種物理現象的光源——首先是水的能見度，再來是顏色發生了甚麼變化。", "en": "One of the most critical elements was how the light travelsthrough the water. So we coded up a lightthat mimics this physics -- first, the visibility of the water, and then what happens with the color."}, {"zh-tw": "靠近我們眼睛的物體較具有完整豐富的色彩。隨著光線穿越到水裡深處時，紅色波長的光會逐漸消失，然後是綠色波長的光，最後最深處的地方，只剩下藍色波長的光。", "en": "Objects close to the eyehave their full, rich colors. As light travels deeper into the water, we lose the red wavelengths, then the green wavelengths, leaving us with blue at the far depths."}, {"zh-tw": "在這段影片中，你可以看到另外兩個重要的元素。第一個是水波紋的呈現，或者是水底下看不到的暗流，這些暗流會推動附近水域的微粒子。", "en": "In this clip you can seetwo other important elements. The first is the surge and swell, or the invisible underwater current that pushes the bits of particulatearound in the water."}, {"zh-tw": "第二個是「焦散面」。由這些光線散焦後所形成的帶子，像是各位在水池底下所看到的「光帶」，也就是陽光穿過海面上的漣漪和波浪時所產生的折射現象。", "en": "The second is the caustics. These are the ribbons of light, like you might seeon the bottom of a pool, that are created when the sunbends through the crests of the ripples and waveson the ocean's surface."}, {"zh-tw": "這個是「霧的光束」，這些線索不僅讓我們了解顏色與深度的關係，也告訴了我們哪個方向是上方，尤其是當你看不到水面時。", "en": "Here we have the fog beams. These give us color depth cues, but also tells which direction is up in shots where we don'tsee the water surface."}, {"zh-tw": "另一件很酷的事情就是，我們會把在「散焦面的微粒子」點亮，讓它在「光帶」中進進出出，它就會呈現忽隱忽現的現象，增添了水底下那種微妙神奇的晶瑩剔透感。你可以看到我們如何使用科學——水的物理現象、照明、波動——緊密地與藝術的自由相連結。", "en": "The other really cool thingyou can see here is that we lit that particulateonly with the caustics, so that as it goes in and outof those ribbons of light, it appears and disappears, lending a subtle, magicalsparkle to the underwater. You can see how we're using the science -- the physics of water,light and movement -- to tether that artistic freedom."}, {"zh-tw": "但我們不因此而感到開心。我們考慮到這些元素彼此間在科學上的準確度，及哪些我們可以移動，以符合故事情節與角色情緒的需要。", "en": "But we are not beholden to it. We considered each of these elements and which ones had to bescientifically accurate and which ones we could push and pullto suit the story and the mood."}, {"zh-tw": "我們在早期就意識到，顏色是一個我們可以發揮的地方。這裡是一個用原始方式上色的水下場景。", "en": "We realized early on that colorwas one we had some leeway with. So here's a traditionally coloredunderwater scene."}, {"zh-tw": "但這裡，我們可以用雪梨港底下的綠色水景，來呈現悲傷事情發生的情境。在這個場景裡，我們了解到深入水底去看是非常重要的，這讓我們了解到了澳洲東部的洋流是長甚麼樣子，這些海龜潛到洋流後，像是在搭雲霄飛車一樣。", "en": "But here, we can take Sydney Harborand push it fairly green to suit the sad mood of what's happening. In this scene, it's really importantwe see deep into the underwater, so we understand whatthe East Australian Current is, that the turtles are diving intoand going on this roller coaster ride."}, {"zh-tw": "所以我們把水的能見度，推進到一個你在真實世界裡從未見過的極致狀態。因為最後，我們並不是要嘗試重現科學正確的真實世界，我們是要嘗試創造出一種令人信服的世界，一個可以讓觀眾將他們自己融入到體驗故事的世界。", "en": "So we pushed the visibility of the water well past anything you wouldever see in real life. Because in the end, we are not trying to recreatethe scientifically correct real world, we're trying to create a believable world, one the audience can immersethemselves in to experience the story."}, {"zh-tw": "我們用科學讓一些東西變得完美。我們利用故事和對藝術的感動將我們帶到一個美麗的世界。", "en": "We use science to createsomething wonderful. We use story and artistic touchto get us to a place of wonder."}, {"zh-tw": "這傢伙，瓦力，就是一個很好的例子。他在最簡單的事物裡，發現了「美」。", "en": "This guy, WALL-E, is a greatexample of that. He finds beauty in the simplest things."}, {"zh-tw": "但是當他要開始照明的時候，我們發現了一個大問題。我們發瘋似地在製作這部很有說服力的瓦力機器人，我們把他的雙筒望遠鏡做的堪稱是光學上的完美作品。", "en": "But when he came in to lighting,we knew we had a big problem. We got so geeked-out on makingWALL-E this convincing robot, that we made his binocularspractically optically perfect."}, {"zh-tw": "他的雙筒望遠鏡是他所擁有最重要的行為裝置之一。他沒有臉，甚至沒有傳統上的對話模式來呈現他的情緒，", "en": "His binoculars are one of the mostcritical acting devices he has. He doesn't have a face or eventraditional dialogue, for that matter."}, {"zh-tw": "所以動畫家們相當依賴這個望遠鏡來展現瓦力的行為和情緒。我們開始照明後，然後我們意識到，在他望遠鏡裡面的3個鏡片造成了反射上的混亂。", "en": "So the animators were heavilydependent on the binoculars to sell his acting and emotions. We started lighting and we realized the triple lenses inside his binocularswere a mess of reflections."}, {"zh-tw": "他看起來有點眼神呆滯。呆滯的眼神基本上沒甚麼說服力，尤其是，當你嘗試要說服觀眾相信那個機器人有自己的個性且有能力可以陷入愛河時。", "en": "He was starting to look glassy-eyed. Now, glassy-eyedis a fundamentally awful thing when you are tryingto convince an audience that a robot has a personalityand he's capable of falling in love."}, {"zh-tw": "所以我們在望遠鏡上下了很多光學上的功夫。試著去找到一個可以維持他真實機器人的性質但同時又可以解決反射問題的方法。所以我們從鏡片上下手。", "en": "So we went to work on these opticallyperfect binoculars, trying to find a solution that wouldmaintain his true robot materials but solve this reflection problem. So we started with the lenses."}, {"zh-tw": "這是一個平面鏡，我們有一個凹面鏡和一個凸面鏡。你們可以看到當它們三個放在一起時，向我們展示了所有的反射狀況。", "en": "Here's the flat-front lens, we have a concave lens and a convex lens. And here you see all three together, showing us all these reflections."}, {"zh-tw": "我們試著關掉它們，我們試著鎖住它們，但都起不了作用。在這裡各位可以看到，有時候我們需要一些具體的東西反射在他的眼睛裡——特別是「伊芙」。", "en": "We tried turning them down, we tried blocking them, nothing was working. You can see here, sometimes we needed something specificreflected in his eyes -- usually Eve."}, {"zh-tw": "所以我們不能在鏡片裡用一些虛假的抽象圖象。這裡「伊芙」出現在第一個鏡片上，我們把「伊芙」放在第二個鏡片上，都沒有用。", "en": "So we couldn't just use some fakedabstract image on the lenses. So here we have Eve on the first lens, we put Eve on the second lens, it's not working."}, {"zh-tw": "我們把它關掉，還是沒有用。然後我們有了驚喜的發現。", "en": "We turn it down, it's still not working. And then we have our eureka moment."}, {"zh-tw": "我們把燈光打到瓦力身上時，燈光意外地從他的眼睛滲透了進去。你可以看到它照亮了這些灰色的光圈片。", "en": "We add a light to WALL-Ethat accidentally leaks into his eyes. You can see it light upthese gray aperture blades."}, {"zh-tw": "突然間，這些光圈片把反射給透視出來了，這是從來沒有的現象。現在我們認定瓦力有了眼睛。", "en": "Suddenly, those aperture bladesare poking through that reflection the way nothing else has. Now we recognize WALL-E as having an eye."}, {"zh-tw": "就如同我們人類的白眼球、彩色的虹膜、以及黑色的瞳孔。現在瓦力有黑色的眼睛、灰色的光圈片和黑色的瞳孔", "en": "As humans we have the white of our eye, the colored iris and the black pupil. Now WALL-E has the black of an eye, the gray aperture blades and the black pupil."}, {"zh-tw": "突然間，瓦力感覺有了他自己的靈魂，像是在他身體裡面有了一個充滿了情緒的角色。之後在電影結束之前，瓦力失去了他的個性，基本上已經算是死去了。", "en": "Suddenly, WALL-E feels like he has a soul, like there's a characterwith emotion inside. Later in the movie towards the end, WALL-E loses his personality, essentially going dead."}, {"zh-tw": "接下來就是把呆滯眼神帶回這個場景的最佳時刻。在下一個場景裡，瓦力重新活了過來。", "en": "This is the perfect time to bring backthat glassy-eyed look. In the next scene,WALL-E comes back to life."}, {"zh-tw": "我們把光線重新帶回到光圈片裡，他就變回了那個我們既喜愛又甜美、有靈魂的機器人了。（影片）瓦力：依芙？丹妮爾范伯格：這些令人意想不到的感動時刻有一種美——當你找到那把釋放機器人靈魂的鎖、當你發掘在你生命中想要做什麼的時刻。", "en": "We bring that light back to bringthe aperture blades back, and he returns to that sweet,soulful robot we've come to love. (Video) WALL-E: Eva? Danielle Feinberg: There's a beautyin these unexpected moments -- when you find the keyto unlocking a robot's soul, the moment when you discoverwhat you want to do with your life."}, {"zh-tw": "在「海底總動員裡」的水母，也是其中一個令我感動的時刻。每部電影裡，多少都有一些場景是很難產出的。", "en": "The jellyfish in \"Finding Nemo\"was one of those moments for me. There are scenes in every moviethat struggle to come together."}, {"zh-tw": "其中一個場景就是這個。導演對這個場景有一個憧憬，這個場景是以一些美麗的南太平洋水母的連續鏡頭影片為基礎的。", "en": "This was one of those scenes. The director had a vision for this scene based on some wonderful footageof jellyfish in the South Pacific."}, {"zh-tw": "隨著我們工作開展開來，我們開始慌張了。導演的評論從平常「觀看-感覺」的對話轉變到對我們數字及比例上越來越多的質疑。", "en": "As we went along, we were floundering. The reviews with the director turned from the normallook-and-feel conversation into more and more questionsabout numbers and percentages."}, {"zh-tw": "也許因為這些場景不是正常的場景，我們當時是以真實生活中的一些東西來做場景的架構的，也有可能是因為我們找不到方法。但這已經變成是用腦而不是用眼睛，用科學而不是用藝術來看這件事了。", "en": "Maybe because unlike normal, we were basing it onsomething in real life, or maybe just because we had lost our way. But it had become about usingour brain without our eyes, the science without the art."}, {"zh-tw": "科學限制了場景的呈現方式。但即使碰到了這麼多的挫折，我仍相信一定有辦法把它變漂亮。", "en": "That scientific tetherwas strangling the scene. But even through all the frustrations, I still believed it could be beautiful."}, {"zh-tw": "所以當提及燈光照明的時候，我就全力以赴了。在我做藍色與粉色的平衡時，那些在水母頭上跳舞的「焦散面」、波浪狀的霧狀光束，好像有甚麼好東西開始要呈現出來了。", "en": "So when it came in to lighting, I dug in. As I worked to balancethe blues and the pinks, the caustics dancingon the jellyfish bells, the undulating fog beams, something promising began to appear."}, {"zh-tw": "有一天早上，我進來檢查前一晚的工作。我相當興奮。", "en": "I came in one morning and checkedthe previous night's work. And I got excited."}, {"zh-tw": "然後我把它拿給燈光導演看，她也很興奮。很快的，我在一個有50個人的暗房，把它展示給導演看。", "en": "And then I showed itto the lighting director and she got excited. Soon, I was showing to the directorin a dark room full of 50 people."}, {"zh-tw": "在等待導演評論的這段時間，你會很希望可以得到一些好的字詞，通常你會把它註記下來，然後再做些修正。之後，希望可以得到最後的指示，來進入到下一個階段。", "en": "In director review, you hope you might get some nice words, then you get some notesand fixes, generally. And then, hopefully, you get a final, signaling to move on to the next stage."}, {"zh-tw": "我簡短做了介紹，然後開始播放水母的場景。導演沉默了一段很長令人快要窒息的時間。", "en": "I gave my intro, and I playedthe jellyfish scene. And the director was silentfor an uncomfortably long amount of time."}, {"zh-tw": "長到讓我開始想．．．「喔，不！完蛋了！」然後他開始鼓掌。產品設計師也開始鼓掌。", "en": "Just long enough for me to think, \"Oh no, this is doomed.\" And then he started clapping. And then the productiondesigner started clapping."}, {"zh-tw": "然後整間的同事開始鼓掌。這就是我以燈光照明為生的重要時刻。", "en": "And then the whole room was clapping. This is the momentthat I live for in lighting."}, {"zh-tw": "在這個時候所有的東西聚合在一起，我們擁有了一個我們相信的世界。我們用數學、科學、程式設計，來創造這些驚奇的世界。", "en": "The moment where it all comes together and we get a world that we can believe in. We use math, science and codeto create these amazing worlds."}, {"zh-tw": "我們用說故事和藝術的方式，使它們活了起來。這個藝術與科學交織的時刻，把世界引領到一個美麗的地方、一個充滿靈魂的地方，一個我們信仰的地方，一個你想像就能成真的地方——一個讓那個小女孩突然意識到，她不僅是個科學家，也是一位藝術家的世界。", "en": "We use storytelling and artto bring them to life. It's this interweaving of art and science that elevates the worldto a place of wonder, a place with soul, a place we can believe in, a place where the thingsyou imagine can become real -- and a world where a girl suddenly realizes not only is she a scientist, but also an artist."}, {"zh-tw": "謝謝各位！", "en": "Thank you."}], "title": "Danielle Feinberg The Magic Ingredient That Brings Pixar Movies To Life"}
