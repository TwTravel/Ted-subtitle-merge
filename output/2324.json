And the question I want to askand answer is this: \"Why do we work?\" Why do we drag ourselvesout of bed every morning instead of living our lives just filled with bouncing from oneTED-like adventure to another? You may be asking yourselvesthat very question. Now, I know of course,we have to make a living, but nobody in this room thinksthat that's the answer to the question, \"Why do we work?\" For folks in this room,the work we do is challenging, it's engaging, it's stimulating,it's meaningful."}, {"zh-tw": "而再幸運一點的話，可能還十分重要所以，雖然我們拿不到錢就不工作但這並非我們行動的理由", "en": "And if we're lucky,it might even be important. So, we wouldn't workif we didn't get paid, but that's not why we do what we do."}, {"zh-tw": "而一般而言我想我們都認為，物質上的回報對於工作而言實在是個挺糟糕的理由當我們說某人「為財推磨」這可不單單只是形容而已", "en": "And in general, I think we think that material rewardsare a pretty bad reason for doing the work that we do. When we say of somebodythat he's \"in it for the money,\" we are not just being descriptive."}, {"zh-tw": "我想這相當明顯但就是這個明顯的事實令我產生一個非常深切的問題為什麼 ─ 如果這麼顯而易見 ─為什麼這星球上絕大多數的人都從事著毫無特色、無法讓他們每天早上起床、離開床舖、到公司報到的工作？我們怎麼任由這星球上大部分的人從事著單調、無意義而扼殺靈魂的工作？為何隨著資本主義逐漸發展，一個製造商品和服務的模式隨之產生卻使得工作原本能帶來的所有非物質滿足全消失了？做著這種工作的員工，無論他們是在工廠、在客服中心還是在運貨倉儲中心都為了酬勞而工作", "en": "Now, I think this is totally obvious, but the very obviousness of itraises what is for me an incredibly profound question. Why, if this is so obvious, why is it that for the overwhelmingmajority of people on the planet, the work they dohas none of the characteristics that get us up and out of bedand off to the office every morning? How is it that we allowthe majority of people on the planet to do work that is monotonous,meaningless and soul-deadening? Why is it that as capitalism developed, it created a mode of production,of goods and services, in which all the nonmaterial satisfactionsthat might come from work were eliminated? Workers who do this kind of work, whether they do it in factories,in call centers, or in fulfillment warehouses, do it for pay."}, {"zh-tw": "他們之所以工作，很明顯地沒有報酬之外的任何理由了所以這便是問題，「為什麼？」答案就在這裡：答案就是科技", "en": "There is certainly no other earthly reasonto do what they do except for pay. So the question is, \"Why?\" And here's the answer: the answer is technology."}, {"zh-tw": "好，我懂，我懂…是是是，科技、自動化腐蝕人性，諸如此類陳腔濫調…但這不是我要說的我不是在談論那一種科技那種包圍了我們的生活、 大家來TED想聽到的科技", "en": "Now, I know, I know -- yeah, yeah, yeah, technology, automationscrews people, blah blah -- that's not what I mean. I'm not talking aboutthe kind of technology that has enveloped our lives,and that people come to TED to hear about."}, {"zh-tw": "我也不是要談論那種關於實物的科技雖然它的影響也很深遠我是在談論另一種科技", "en": "I'm not talking aboutthe technology of things, profound though that is. I'm talking about another technology."}, {"zh-tw": "我在談論和想法有關的科技，我稱之為「想法科技」─看看我多聰明", "en": "I'm talking about the technology of ideas. I call it, \"idea technology\" -- how clever of me."}, {"zh-tw": "在創作實物之外，科學也創造想法科學創造理解事物的方式", "en": "In addition to creating things,science creates ideas. Science creates ways of understanding."}, {"zh-tw": "而在社會科學中，我們創造出理解事物的方式，就是理解我們自己的方式它們大大影響了我們如何思考、渴望什麼以及如何行動", "en": "And in the social sciences, the ways of understanding that get createdare ways of understanding ourselves. And they have an enormous influenceon how we think, what we aspire to, and how we act."}, {"zh-tw": "如果你認為你的貧困是上天的旨意，你會祈禱如果你認為你的貧困來自於自身的不足你會失落而萎靡不振", "en": "If you think your povertyis God's will, you pray. If you think your poverty is the resultof your own inadequacy, you shrink into despair."}, {"zh-tw": "而如果你認為你的貧困來自於他人的壓迫和統治你便會起而反抗無論你對貧困的回應是服從認分或是發動革命一切要看你如何理解自己貧困的來源", "en": "And if you think your poverty isthe result of oppression and domination, then you rise up in revolt. Whether your response to povertyis resignation or revolution, depends on how you understandthe sources of your poverty."}, {"zh-tw": "這就是想法在將我們形塑成人時扮演的角色這也是為何想法科技可能是科學帶給我們的一切中最深切重要的一種科技想法科技有一個特點讓它和跟實物的科技有所不同", "en": "This is the role that ideas playin shaping us as human beings, and this is why idea technology may bethe most profoundly important technology that science gives us. And there's something specialabout idea technology, that makes it differentfrom the technology of things."}, {"zh-tw": "跟實物有關的科技，要是它爛透了它就會直接消失，對吧？差勁的科技會失去蹤影至於想法呢 ─關於人類的錯誤想法很難真正消失只要有人對其深信不疑", "en": "With things, if the technology sucks, it just vanishes, right? Bad technology disappears. With ideas -- false ideas about human beingswill not go away if people believe that they're true."}, {"zh-tw": "因為只要有人深信不疑他們創造的生活方式和機構就會和那些非常錯誤的想法一致而這就是工業革命如何創造了工廠系統讓人在這個系統裡日日勞碌，卻什麼也得不到除了一天結束時的工資之外", "en": "Because if people believethat they're true, they create ways of livingand institutions that are consistentwith these very false ideas. And that's how the industrial revolutioncreated a factory system in which there was really nothing youcould possibly get out of your day's work, except for the pay at the end of the day."}, {"zh-tw": "正因為那位 ─ 其中一位 ─工業革命之父，亞當·史密斯─深深相信人類的天性就是懶惰除非覺得划得來，否則什麼也不幹而讓他們值回票價的方法就是激勵他們，給他們回報這是天底下任何人會去做任何事的唯一理由", "en": "Because the father --one of the fathers of the Industrial Revolution,Adam Smith -- was convinced that human beingswere by their very natures lazy, and wouldn't do anythingunless you made it worth their while, and the way you made it worth their while was by incentivizing,by giving them rewards. That was the only reasonanyone ever did anything."}, {"zh-tw": "因此基於對人性的錯誤想法，我們創立了相對應的工廠系統但是一旦這種生產系統上了軌道我們就再也找不到另一種可能的運作方式，只剩下和亞當·史密斯觀點一致的這種方式", "en": "So we created a factory system consistentwith that false view of human nature. But once that systemof production was in place, there was really no other wayfor people to operate, except in a way that was consistentwith Adam Smith's vision."}, {"zh-tw": "所以這個工作的案例僅僅是一個範例告訴我們錯誤的想法如何創造出最後讓它變成事實的環境世上其實沒有什麼真正「已經無計可施」的情況真正「無計可施」的情況發生在你丟給他們那些毫無意義又沒有靈魂的工作時", "en": "So the work example is merely an example of how false ideascan create a circumstance that ends up making them true. It is not true that you \"just can't getgood help anymore.\" It is true that you \"can't get good help anymore\" when you give people work to dothat is demeaning and soulless."}, {"zh-tw": "而相當有趣的是，亞當·史密斯─那個給了我們這個不可思議的發明給了我們大量製造、勞務分工的構想的人─ 很清楚這件事他說過，在組裝線上工作的人對於組裝線上的員工，他說：「他通常會變成人類愚蠢到最極致的狀態」好好注意，他用的詞是「變成」「他通常會變成人類愚蠢到最極致的狀態」無論他是不是故意的，亞當·史密斯告訴我們的是正是這個我們在其中工作的機構型態製造出符合這個機構需求的人同時從他們認為理所當然的工作中剝奪了他們從中獲得各種滿足的機會", "en": "And interestingly enough, Adam Smith -- the same guy who gave usthis incredible invention of mass production, and division of labor -- understood this. He said, of people who workedin assembly lines, of men who workedin assembly lines, he says: \"He generally becomes as stupid as it ispossible for a human being to become.\" Now, notice the word here is \"become.\" \"He generally becomes as stupid as it ispossible for a human being to become.\" Whether he intended it or not,what Adam Smith was telling us there, is that the very shape of the institutionwithin which people work creates people who are fittedto the demands of that institution and deprives people of the opportunity to derive the kinds of satisfactionsfrom their work that we take for granted."}, {"zh-tw": "科學這回事 ─ 自然科學 ─就是我們可以對於宇宙理論進行天馬行空的構想同時可以完全確信這個宇宙完完全全不會受到我們製造的理論影響一切將該死地一如往常運轉無論我們製造出什麼關於宇宙的理論", "en": "The thing about science --natural science -- is that we can spin fantastictheories about the cosmos, and have complete confidence that the cosmos is completelyindifferent to our theories. It's going to work the same damn way no matter what theorieswe have about the cosmos."}, {"zh-tw": "但我們確實該擔心我們製造出的、關於人性的理論因為人性是會被改變的，被這些我們設計出來、為了解釋和協助我們更加瞭解人類的理論所改變著名的人類學家克利福德·格爾茨幾年前曾說人類是「不完全的動物」而他的意思是，只有人性是一種幾乎可說是被我們生活在其中的社會所製造出來的本質", "en": "But we do have to worry aboutthe theories we have of human nature, because human nature will be changedby the theories we have that are designed to explainand help us understand human beings. The distinguished anthropologist,Clifford Geertz, said, years ago, that human beingsare the \"unfinished animals.\" And what he meant by thatwas that it is only human nature to have a human nature that is very much the productof the society in which people live."}, {"zh-tw": "那種人性 ─ 也就是說我們人性本質被創造出來的部分，遠比被發現的部分更多我們設計了人性 ──透過設計人類生活和工作其中的機構", "en": "That human nature,that is to say our human nature, is much more createdthan it is discovered. We design human nature by designing the institutionswithin which people live and work."}, {"zh-tw": "所以在座各位 ─恐怕是我能遇到、最接近能夠主宰宇宙萬物的人群 ─當你們回去繼續運作你們的組織時，應該問自己一個問題你們想要設計什麼樣的人性?謝謝各位", "en": "And so you people -- pretty much the closest I ever getto being with masters of the universe -- you people should be askingyourself a question, as you go back hometo run your organizations. Just what kind of human naturedo you want to help design? Thank you."}, {"zh-tw": "謝謝", "en": "Thanks."}], "title": "Barry Schwartz The Way We Think About Work Is Broken"}
