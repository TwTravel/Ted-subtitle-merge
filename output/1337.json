This is a conditionin which the heart fails, and instead of being ableto pump all the blood forward, some of the blood backs up into the lung,the lungs fill up with blood, and that's why you haveshortness of breath."}, {"zh-tw": "這在診斷上並不困難。我做了診斷，安排治療。", "en": "And that wasn't a difficultdiagnosis to make. I made it and I set to work treating her."}, {"zh-tw": "我開了阿斯匹靈和一些藥物來減輕她心臟的收縮。我給她的藥物，是我們稱之為利尿劑，水丸幫助她將多餘的水分排出。", "en": "I gave her aspirin. I gave her medicationsto relieve the strain on her heart.

Actually, I made two more mistakes."}, {"zh-tw": "我讓她回家前沒有告知我的上級主治醫生。我甚至沒有把電話機拿起，做我應該做的事就是打電話給主治醫生，報告整件事情。他原本有機會親自前來診斷。", "en": "I sent her home without speaking to my attending.

Maybe I did it for a good reason."}, {"zh-tw": "也許我不想成為一位老是被指導的住院醫生。也許我太想成功想證明我是可以獨當一面的我可以做,我有能力照護主治醫生的病人,而且不需要聯繫他。", "en": "Maybe I didn't want to bea high-maintenance resident. Maybe I wanted to be so successful and so able to take responsibility that I would do so and I would be able to takecare of my attending's patients without even having to contact him."}, {"zh-tw": "但第二個錯誤是更嚴重的。讓她出院回家,我忽視心裡一個很小的聲音這個聲音試圖告訴我,「Goldman，這樣不對，別這麼做」。事實上，我當時沒什麼自信,所以我詢問了看顧Drucker女士的護士。「你覺得她回家好嗎？」然後護士想了一下,就事論事地說「嗯，我想她可以的。」在我記憶裡, 那就像是昨天發生的事。", "en": "The second mistake that I made was worse. In sending her home, I disregarded a little voicedeep down inside that was trying to tell me, \"Goldman, not a good idea. Don't do this.\" In fact, so lacking in confidence was I that I actually asked the nurse who was looking after Mrs. Drucker, \"Do you think it's okay if she goes home?\" And the nurse thought about it and said very matter-of-factly,\"Yeah, I think she'll do okay.\" I can remember that like it was yesterday."}, {"zh-tw": "所以我簽了出院文件救護車來了，醫務人員帶她回家。我回到我的工作崗位。", "en": "So I signed the discharge papers, and an ambulance came, paramedicscame to take her home. And I went back to my work on the wards."}, {"zh-tw": "之後的那一整天。那個下午我一直被惱人的情緒干擾。但我還是繼續工作。", "en": "All the rest of that day, that afternoon, I had this kind of gnawingfeeling inside my stomach. But I carried on with my work."}, {"zh-tw": "那天結束，我收拾東西離開醫院然後走到停車場取車回家當時我做了一件我平常不會做的事。我穿越急診室去停車場", "en": "And at the end of the day,I packed up to leave the hospital and walked to the parking lot to take my car and drive home when I did somethingthat I don't usually do. I walked through the emergencydepartment on my way home."}, {"zh-tw": "那裡有另一位護士,不是原先那位看顧Druker女士的那位，是另一位她告訴我三個字就這三個字大部分我認識的急診室醫生都害怕。其他醫界的人也害怕,但對急診醫學來說這件事比較特別因為我們看診的病人來去匆匆。", "en": "And it was there that another nurse, not the nurse who was lookingafter Mrs. Drucker before, but another nurse, said three words to me that are the three words that most emergencyphysicians I know dread. Others in medicine dread them as well, but there's something particularabout emergency medicine because we see patients so fleetingly."}, {"zh-tw": "那三個字是\"記得嗎？\"\"你記得你讓她出院的那病人嗎？\"那位護士就事論事地說「她又回來了」用那種就事論事的聲調。", "en": "The three words are: Do you remember? \"Do you rememberthat patient you sent home?\" the other nurse asked matter-of-factly. \"Well she's back,\" in just that tone of voice."}, {"zh-tw": "好吧，她回來了她回來，而且差點過世", "en": "Well she was back all right. She was back and near death."}, {"zh-tw": "我讓她回家後到家後的一小時她昏倒了，她家人打緊急電話求救然後救護人員把她送回急診室當時她的血壓只有50嚴重休克她幾乎沒有呼吸，臉色發青。", "en": "About an hour after she had arrived home, after I'd sent her home, she collapsed and her family called 911 and the paramedics brought herback to the emergency department where she had a blood pressure of 50, which is in severe shock. And she was barely breathingand she was blue."}, {"zh-tw": "然後急診室人員使出渾身解數要使她血壓恢復。", "en": "And the emerg. staffpulled out all the stops. They gave her medicationsto raise her blood pressure."}, {"zh-tw": "他們讓她戴上呼吸器。我震驚不已我嚇得不得了。", "en": "They put her on a ventilator. And I was shocked and shaken to the core."}, {"zh-tw": "我像坐上雲霄飛車因為後來他們穩住了她的病情她被送到加護病房但我希望她有機會好轉。在接下來的兩三天很明顯地她再也不會醒來。", "en": "And I went through this roller coaster, because after they stabilized her, she went to the intensive care unit, and I hoped against hopethat she would recover. And over the next two or three days, it was clear that she was nevergoing to wake up."}, {"zh-tw": "她的腦部受損已經不會好轉。她的家人聚在一起", "en": "She had irreversible brain damage. And the family gathered."}, {"zh-tw": "在之後八九天的治療期間他們接受了這件事實。九天後，他們放棄治療，讓她離開人間Druker女士,一位妻子，一位母親也是一位祖母。", "en": "And over the courseof the next eight or nine days, they resigned themselvesto what was happening. And at about the nine daymark, they let her go -- Mrs. Drucker, a wife, a mother and a grandmother."}, {"zh-tw": "他們說你會永遠忘不了那些(因你疏忽而死的)名字那是我第一次意識到。", "en": "They say you never forget the names of those who die. And that was my first timeto be acquainted with that."}, {"zh-tw": "在接下來的幾週,我非常自責。我也第一次經歷了那種不健康的羞愧存在於我們醫界的文化中--在那兒我感到孤單無助不是像各位會感受到的那種的羞愧因為你沒辦法和你的同事訴說。有一種健康的羞愧是當你背叛了對摯友的承諾你說出了原先答應要保守的秘密而當你的摯友找你算帳時你們爭執不休但最後罪感主導著你然後你說，我絕對不會再犯相同的錯。", "en": "Over the next few weeks, I beat myself up and I experienced for the first time the unhealthy shame that exists in our culture of medicine -- where I felt alone, isolated, not feeling the healthy kindof shame that you feel, because you can't talkabout it with your colleagues. You know that healthy kind, when you betray a secret that a bestfriend made you promise never to reveal and then you get busted and then your best friend confronts you and you have terrible discussions, but at the end of itall that sick feeling guides you and you say, I'll nevermake that mistake again."}, {"zh-tw": "你做了修正承諾，然後你永不再犯同樣的錯。這種羞愧可以教導我們", "en": "And you make amends and younever make that mistake again. That's the kind of shamethat is a teacher."}, {"zh-tw": "而我所說那種非良性的羞愧是那種會讓人愧對於心的是那種不是你做了壞事而是你根本就是壞人。", "en": "The unhealthy shame I'm talking about is the one that makes you so sick inside. It's the one that says, not that what you did was bad, but that you are bad."}, {"zh-tw": "這是我當時候的感受。由於我跟隨的主治樂心助人", "en": "And it was what I was feeling. And it wasn't because of my attending;he was a doll."}, {"zh-tw": "和他的家人好好談過，我確定他替我打了圓場才能確保我不會被控告。我不斷問自己這些問題。", "en": "He talked to the family, and I'm quitesure that he smoothed things over and made sure that I didn't get sued. And I kept asking myself these questions."}, {"zh-tw": "為什麼當時我沒有聯繫主治醫生？為什麼我讓她回家？我最糟的回憶是:我為什麼犯了這麼愚蠢的錯？為什麼我選擇進入醫界?慢慢地，但穩定地糟糕的感覺漸淡了。我的感覺緩和了些。", "en": "Why didn't I ask my attending?Why did I send her home? And then at my worst moments: Why did I make such a stupid mistake? Why did I go into medicine? Slowly but surely, it lifted. I began to feel a bit better."}, {"zh-tw": "然後在一個天氣陰陰的日子裡陽光開始從雲隙間探出我思考著也許我能讓自己再次快樂起來。我告訴自己我要加倍努力，做到完美不要再犯錯了請就讓那個(自責)聲音停止。", "en": "And on a cloudy day, there was a crack in the cloudsand the sun started to come out and I wondered, maybe I could feel better again. And I made myself a bargain that if only I redoublemy efforts to be perfect and never make another mistake again, please make the voices stop."}, {"zh-tw": "那個聲音的確停止了。我回到工作崗位", "en": "And they did. And I went back to work."}, {"zh-tw": "但錯誤又發生了。兩年後，我在多倫多北部一間社區醫院擔任急診室的主治醫生。我看了一位二十五歲的病人，他有喉嚨痛", "en": "And then it happened again. Two years later I was an attendingin the emergency department at a community hospitaljust north of Toronto, and I saw a 25 year-oldman with a sore throat."}, {"zh-tw": "那天很忙，我也有點手忙腳亂他不斷指著這裡", "en": "It was busy, I was in a bit of a hurry. He kept pointing here."}, {"zh-tw": "我看了他的喉嚨，有點紅色。我開給他盤尼西林的處方籤,就讓他離開。", "en": "I looked at his throat,it was a little bit pink. And I gave him a prescriptionfor penicillin and sent him on his way."}, {"zh-tw": "即便他要走出大門時他仍然指著他的喉嚨。兩天後，我又輪到在急診室值班那時候我的主任要我過去她的辦公室私下談談", "en": "And even as he was walking out the door, he was still sortof pointing to his throat. And two days later I came to domy next emergency shift, and that's when my chief askedto speak to me quietly in her office."}, {"zh-tw": "她說了那三個字:\"記得嗎？\"\"你記得你看過的那位喉嚨痛的病人嗎？\"原來，他並沒有鍊球菌性咽喉炎。他得到的是一種會嚴重威脅生命的病症叫做急性會厭炎。", "en": "And she said the three words: Do you remember? \"Do you remember that patientyou saw with the sore throat?\" Well it turns out, he didn'thave a strep throat. He had a potentiallylife-threatening condition called epiglottitis."}, {"zh-tw": "各位可以上網查詢不是喉嚨感染，而是上呼吸道感染,會造成呼吸道阻塞。幸好他沒過世。", "en": "You can Google it, but it's an infection, notof the throat, but of the upper airway, and it can actually causethe airway to close. And fortunately he didn't die."}, {"zh-tw": "他被安排去做抗生素靜脈注射幾天之後，他痊癒了。我又回到那個愧疚和責難的時光中然後情緒平復後，回到工作崗位直到這些錯誤再發生, 歷史一直重複。", "en": "He was placed on intravenous antibiotics and he recovered after a few days. And I went through the same periodof shame and recriminations and felt cleansed and went back to work, until it happened againand again and again."}, {"zh-tw": "一個急診的輪班裡發生兩次，我沒發現病人得了盲腸炎。這是很難想像會發生的事特別是當你在醫院工作整個晚上你只有十四名病患。", "en": "Twice in one emergency shift,I missed appendicitis. Now that takes some doing, especially when you work in a hospital that at the time sawbut 14 people a night."}, {"zh-tw": "對這兩個病人，我沒有讓他們回家我也不覺得在治療過程中有任何差錯。其中一位我判斷他有腎結石。", "en": "Now in both cases, I didn't send them home and I don't think therewas any gap in their care. One I thought had a kidney stone."}, {"zh-tw": "我安排照了腎臟X光，但結果正常。我同事當時正在對病人病情重新診斷注意到病人右下腹的地方按壓會痛，就聯繫了外科醫生。另一個病人有嚴重的腹瀉", "en": "I ordered a kidney X-ray. Whenit turned out to be normal, my colleague who was doinga reassessment of the patient noticed some tenderness in the rightlower quadrant and called the surgeons. The other one had a lot of diarrhea."}, {"zh-tw": "我開了一些藥水幫助他補充水分也要求我同事重新診斷。他做了他注意到病人右下腹的地方按壓會痛，也聯繫了外科醫生。", "en": "I ordered some fluids to rehydrate him and asked my colleague to reassess him. And he did and when he noticed some tenderness in the rightlower quadrant, called the surgeons."}, {"zh-tw": "這兩個病例他們都動了手術，狀況良好。但每次想到這兩例子那種感覺折磨啃噬我。", "en": "In both cases, they had their operationsand they did okay. But each time, they were gnawing at me, eating at me."}, {"zh-tw": "我非常想要告訴各位我最嚴重的錯誤只發生在頭五年的行醫歷史中像我眾多同事們所說的一樣，但是這是鬼扯。在最近的五年內, 我也發生一些糗事。", "en": "And I'd like to be able to say to you that my worst mistakes only happenedin the first five years of practice as many of my colleaguessay, which is total B.S. Some of my doozies havebeen in the last five years."}, {"zh-tw": "孤單，羞愧，無助。問題的癥結是:如果我不能理清楚談論我犯的錯,如果我不能找到那微小的聲音告訴著我事實是如何。我該如何跟我的同事分享經驗？我該如何教導他們, 我犯的錯誤。讓他們不再重蹈覆轍呢？如果我進入一個場合 --就像現在，我不知道各位會如何看待我。", "en": "Alone, ashamed and unsupported. Here's the problem: If I can't come clean and talk about my mistakes, if I can't find the still-small voice that tells me what really happened, how can I share it with my colleagues? How can I teach them about what I did so that they don't do the same thing? If I were to walk into a room -- like right now, I have noidea what you think of me."}, {"zh-tw": "上一次各位聽到別人談論有關自己一次又一次的失敗是什麼時候？是的，如果各位去參加一場宴會你或許會聽到某些醫生的閒聊,但各位不會聽到有人談論自己的過錯。如果我走進一個場合，裡頭坐滿我的同事我向他們尋求認同然後開始跟他們說，我剛告訴各位的事情在我還沒講超過兩個故事前他們就會感到非常不自在。有人就會開始說笑話,想要改變話題，然後拋棄前個話題。", "en": "When was the last timeyou heard somebody talk about failure after failure after failure? Oh yeah, you go to a cocktail party and you might hearabout some other doctor, but you're not going to hear somebody talking about their own mistakes. If I were to walk into a roomfilled with my colleages and ask for their support right now and start to tell what I've justtold you right now, I probably wouldn't getthrough two of those stories before they would startto get really uncomfortable, somebody would crack a joke, they'd change the subjectand we would move on."}, {"zh-tw": "事實上，如果我知道或我同事知道我們其中一位骨科同事在醫院裡幫病人截錯肢相信我，我會有困難跟他有任何正面的交會。這就是我們的制度。", "en": "And in fact, if I knewand my colleagues knew that one of my orthopedic colleaguestook off the wrong leg in my hospital, believe me, I'd have trouble making eye contact with that person. That's the system that we have."}, {"zh-tw": "完全否認錯誤的系統。這個制度下只有兩種情況--一邊是犯錯的一邊是沒犯錯的一邊是不能調適眠眠被剝削，一邊則可以一邊是糟糕的結果一邊則有優秀的結果", "en": "It's a complete denial of mistakes. It's a system in which there are two kindsof physicians -- those who make mistakes and those who don't, those who can't handle sleepdeprivation and those who can, those who have lousy outcomes and those who have great outcomes."}, {"zh-tw": "這幾乎像是意識形態的反應像抗體一樣，開始攻擊那個人我們有這個想法:如果我們趕走那些犯錯的人讓他們離開醫界,我們就會留下一個安全的制度。", "en": "And it's almostlike an ideological reaction, like the antibodies beginto attack that person. And we have this idea that if we drive the peoplewho make mistakes out of medicine, what will we be leftwith, but a safe system."}, {"zh-tw": "但這樣做會衍生兩個問題。這二十多年來我從事醫療報導和新聞工作我自行探討了醫療疏失和醫療錯誤所有相關的事。從我為多倫多星報所寫的第一則新聞到我的節目《白袍與黑色藝術》。我所學到的是錯誤絕對無所不在。", "en": "But there are two problems with that. In my 20 years or so of medical broadcasting and journalism, I've made a personal study of medicalmalpractice and medical errors to learn everything I can, from one of the first articlesI wrote for the Toronto Star to my show \"White Coat, Black Art.\" And what I've learned is that errors are absolutely ubiquitous."}, {"zh-tw": "我們在一個每天都會發生錯誤的制度下工作。有十分之一的機會,醫院會給錯藥或是給了錯誤的劑量。而在醫院內的感染越來越多造成傷害和死亡。在這個國家有24,000加拿大人死於可避免的醫療疏失。", "en": "We work in a system where errors happen every day, where one in 10 medications are either the wrongmedication given in hospital or at the wrong dosage, where hospital-acquired infectionsare getting more and more numerous, causing havoc and death.

We can't get rid of it."}, {"zh-tw": "而我們有自己的直覺偏差,對相同病歷史完整的胸痛病人,會有不同診斷結果。拿一個有胸痛病症的病人來說如果當時他胡言亂語,再加上他的呼吸有酒精味,那我們會認為他其實是喝醉了。因為這樣誤診, 然後我的醫療生涯突然蒙羞。", "en": "We have our cognitive biases, so that I can take a perfect historyon a patient with chest pain.
