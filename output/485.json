This proposition will be found on careful examination to express, in condensed form, the essential purport of the Theory, and to express in a few words all Mr. Darwin’s meaning; who, by a strange inversion of reasoning, seems to think Absolute Ignorance fully qualified to take the place of Absolute Wisdom in the achievements of creative skill.\" Exactly. Exactly. And it is a strange inversion.", "zh-tw": "「據此理論，『無知』為萬物之始此一基本原則，為系統之基石舉例而言，『要製造一台完美的機器其實並不需要了解製造方法。』達爾文經由縝密思慮得此論點且以錘鍊之字句表明其主旨簡單明瞭地傳達其意其逆向推理獨到之處在於肯定『無知』，視其為難得之物可取代『全知』，輔創新之念於大成」的確 這個理論確實背離一般常理"}, {"en": "A creationist pamphlet has this wonderful page in it: \"Test Two: Do you know of any building that didn’t have a builder? Yes/No. Do you know of any painting that didn’t have a painter? Yes/No.", "zh-tw": "神造世界論者的傳單上可能會問測驗二有建築不出自建築者之手嗎？有畫作不出自創作者之手嗎？"}, {"en": "Do you know of any car that didn’t have a maker? Yes/No. If you answered 'Yes' for any of the above, give details.\" A-ha! I mean, it really is a strange inversion of reasoning.", "zh-tw": "有車子不出自製造者之手嗎？如果你都回答「有」，請舉例詳細說明哈！這就是我所謂違常的逆向推理"}, {"en": "You would have thought it stands to reason that design requires an intelligent designer. But Darwin shows that it’s just false.", "zh-tw": "你可能一向認為每個設計都需要厲害的設計師達爾文卻認為這樣才不合理"}, {"en": "Today, though, I’m going to talk about Darwin’s other strange inversion, which is equally puzzling at first, but in some ways just as important. It stands to reason that we love chocolate cake because it is sweet.", "zh-tw": "不過今天解釋的是其他逆向推理乍聽時一樣難懂，不過同等重要我們喜歡蛋糕，因為它是甜的"}, {"en": "Guys go for girls like this because they are sexy. We adore babies because they’re so cute.", "zh-tw": "男人都愛辣妹，因為她們性感我們喜歡嬰兒，因為他們很可愛"}, {"en": "And, of course, we are amused by jokes because they are funny. This is all backwards. It is. And Darwin shows us why.", "zh-tw": "還有，笑話引人發噱是因為好笑達爾文解釋 這些推論都倒果為因"}, {"en": "Let’s start with sweet. Our sweet tooth is basically an evolved sugar detector, because sugar is high energy, and it’s just been wired up to the preferer, to put it very crudely, and that’s why we like sugar. Honey is sweet because we like it, not \"we like it because honey is sweet.\" There’s nothing intrinsically sweet about honey.", "zh-tw": "喜愛甜食是因為人對糖分很敏感我們需要糖的高能量 因此人腦才將糖設定為我們喜歡的物質蜂蜜會甜是因為我們喜歡蜂蜜蜂蜜在本質上沒有甜的成分"}, {"en": "If you looked at glucose molecules till you were blind, you wouldn’t see why they tasted sweet. You have to look in our brains to understand why they’re sweet.", "zh-tw": "即使你死盯著葡萄糖的分子結構你還是不知道為什麼它是甜的原因其實就藏在我們的大腦裡"}, {"en": "So if you think first there was sweetness, and then we evolved to like sweetness, you’ve got it backwards; that’s just wrong. It’s the other way round. Sweetness was born with the wiring which evolved.", "zh-tw": "如果你先假定，甜食中有甜的成分我們的大腦演化成喜歡這種成分那就錯了 應該要倒過來才對甜味是隨著大腦的演化而誕生"}, {"en": "And there’s nothing intrinsically sexy about these young ladies. And it’s a good thing that there isn’t, because if there were, then Mother Nature would have a problem: How on earth do you get chimps to mate?

Just wire the chimps up to love that look, and apparently they do.", "zh-tw": "這是一個方法；但還有一個更快的就是改變黑猩猩的腦迴路讓牠們喜歡那種長相的伴侶"}, {"en": "That’s all there is to it. Over six million years, we and the chimps evolved our different ways.", "zh-tw": "奧秘說穿了就是這樣演化至今，人跟黑猩猩已大不相同"}, {"en": "We became bald-bodied, oddly enough; for one reason or another, they didn’t. If we hadn’t, then probably this would be the height of sexiness.", "zh-tw": "我們全身的毛髮退化但出於某些原因 牠們的卻沒有若我們也沒有，那或許這才是性感"}, {"en": "Our sweet tooth is an evolved and instinctual preference for high-energy food. It wasn’t designed for chocolate cake.", "zh-tw": "我們喜歡甜食，是因為它的高能量跟巧克力蛋糕本身無關"}, {"en": "Chocolate cake is a supernormal stimulus. The term is owed to Niko Tinbergen, who did his famous experiments with gulls, where he found that that orange spot on the gull’s beak -- if he made a bigger, oranger spot the gull chicks would peck at it even harder.", "zh-tw": "巧克力蛋糕是種超乎尋常的刺激諾貝爾生物學獎得主丁柏格做過一個有名的海鷗實驗他發現海鷗嘴上那個橘色的點如果變大一點或顏色更鮮豔一點小海鷗啄食它時會更用力"}, {"en": "It was a hyperstimulus for them, and they loved it. What we see with, say, chocolate cake is it’s a supernormal stimulus to tweak our design wiring.", "zh-tw": "它對小海鷗而言是個強烈的刺激實驗的意義是 超乎尋常的刺激像是巧克力蛋糕 會改變天性"}, {"en": "And there are lots of supernormal stimuli; chocolate cake is one. There's lots of supernormal stimuli for sexiness.", "zh-tw": "還有很多東西是超乎尋常的刺激有些會引發性感的感覺"}, {"en": "And there's even supernormal stimuli for cuteness. Here’s a pretty good example. It’s important that we love babies, and that we not be put off by, say, messy diapers.", "zh-tw": "有些會引發可愛的感覺 舉個例子嬰兒必須討喜，所以即使弄髒尿布"}, {"en": "So babies have to attract our affection and our nurturing, and they do.
