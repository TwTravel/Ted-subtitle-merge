I remember watchingSaturday morning cartoons, paying more attention to the commercials than to the shows, trying to figure out how they were tryingto get inside my head."}, {"zh-tw": "而這一興趣最終將我帶向了我的我成了紐約一間大型廣告公司的合夥人", "en": "Ultimately, that led me to my dream job. I became a partnerat a big New York ad agency."}, {"zh-tw": "但在1997年2月23號一夕之間風雲變色那天我的弟弟馬特在帝國大廈觀景台的槍擊案中被射中頭部霎時 我們全家掉入了無底的噩夢我們被告知我的弟弟將要死去並讓我們向他告別接著在經歷了幾場緊急的腦部手術後馬特之後的一生都得和嚴重腦部創傷纏鬥", "en": "But then, all of that suddenly changedon February 23, 1997, when my little brother Mattwas shot in the head in a shooting that happenedon the observation deck of the Empire State Building. Suddenly, my family was throwninto the middle of a nightmare, being told that my brotherwas going to die, actually being given the opportunityto say goodbye to him, then several emergency brain surgeries and now what's amounted, for Matt, to a lifetime spent courageouslyrecovering from a traumatic brain injury."}, {"zh-tw": "他絕對是我的英雄但當 是的 他值得我們尊敬但即便我們家遇到這種悲劇我卻時常想著這情況原本也許會更糟事實上 每天都有90個家庭會遭逢這樣的不幸他們失去摯愛的親人兄弟姊妹 妻兒老小", "en": "He is definitely my hero. But as much as  --yeah, deserves it -- But as much as this tragedywas a nightmare for my family, I often think about how much worseit could have been; in fact, how much worseit is for the 90 families every day who aren't as fortunate, who lose loved ones -- brothers,sisters, sons, daughters, parents."}, {"zh-tw": "這樣的悲劇不會登上全國新聞或者說 大多數情況下得不到關注", "en": "They don't all make national headlines. In fact, most of them don't."}, {"zh-tw": "他們的不幸常常被忽視這個國家已經將這件可恥的慘劇視為不足為奇的常態所以我辭了廣告的工作試著對這不名譽的全國性瘟疫做點什麼因為我發覺杜絕槍械暴力所帶來的挑戰正如同我所鍾愛的廣告都是在找出如何感染他人", "en": "They go largely unnoticed, in a nation that's kind of come to accepta disgraceful national epidemic as some kind of new normal. So I quit my job in advertising to try and do something aboutthis disgraceful national epidemic, because I came to realize that the challengesto preventing gun violence are actually the same onesthat made me love advertising, which is to try to figure outhow to engage people."}, {"zh-tw": "差別是廣告賣的是商品我們賣的是救命我要找的是共通點也就是我想要的和你想要的有所重疊", "en": "Only instead of doing it to sell products, doing it to save lives.

Why? I kind of hate to say it, because it gets to the darkunderbelly of advertising, which is if you tella big enough lie enough times, eventually that lie becomes the truth."}, {"zh-tw": "而這件事正在發生軍火商花了數十億美元阻止疾病管制署進行槍枝暴力研究；阻止小兒科醫師跟家長講有槍在家對小孩的危險性；阻止能夠防止小孩用家長的槍、並可以拯救生命的智慧槍枝科技", "en": "And that's exactly what's happened here.

Enough of the daily terrorof gun violence in homes and streets that's claimed the lives of womenand young black men in staggering proportions."}, {"zh-tw": "受夠了那些不該有槍的人那麼容易的就買到槍受夠了少數沒擔當的政客背棄他的選民並向軍火利益靠攏", "en": "Enough of easy access to guns by the people that we all agreeshouldn't have them.
