It's so important that the very toolswe use to understand ourselves, to understand the world around us, are shaped by that stance."}, {"zh-tw": "我們完完全全是社會動物我對自閉症的了解是從我住進一個為自閉症患者而設的成人之家中開始的", "en": "We are social to the core. So my journey in autism really started when I lived in a residential unitfor adults with autism."}, {"zh-tw": "他們多數都在醫院裡度過大部分的人生這是很久以前的事了", "en": "Most of those individualshad spent most of their lives in long-stay hospitals. This is a long time ago."}, {"zh-tw": "對他們來說，自閉症是場災難他們有嚴重的智力障礙、不說話", "en": "And for them, autism was devastating. They had profoundintellectual disabilities."}, {"zh-tw": "更糟的是他們極度封閉在自己的世界裡與周遭的環境隔絕與他人隔絕", "en": "They didn't talk. But most of all, they were extraordinarily isolatedfrom the world around them, from their environment and from the people."}, {"zh-tw": "如果你走進一所當時的自閉症特教學校事實上你會聽到很多聲音喧鬧聲、人們做各種事情的聲音但他們總是各自做自己的事", "en": "In fact, at the time,if you walked into a school for individuals with autism, you'd hear a lot of noise, plenty of commotion, actions,people doing things.

They prefer to look at peoplerather than at things, and even as they're looking at people,they look at people's eyes, because the eye is the windowto the other person's experiences, so much so that they even preferto look at people who are looking at themrather than people who are looking away."}, {"zh-tw": "他們追尋照顧他們的人照顧者則追尋著嬰兒", "en": "Well, they orient to the caregiver.

As babies engage with caregivers,they soon realize that, well, there is something between the earsthat is very important -- it's invisible, you can't see it,but it's really critical."}, {"zh-tw": "就是別人對他們的關注在能夠開口說話前他們就先學會藉由吸引別人的注意來得到自己想要的", "en": "And that thing is called attention.

Now, for this girl,that division line is not so clear, and the world of peopleis not attracting her as much as we would like."}, {"zh-tw": "我們很多的學習都是從經驗分享而來現在在她身上發生的事是她的學習隨著她越來越封閉自己而逐漸走上不同的道路", "en": "Now, remember that we learn a great dealby sharing experiences. What she is doing right nowis that her path of learning is diverging, moment by moment, as she is isolating herselffurther and further."}, {"zh-tw": "所以有時候我們會覺得大腦決定了我們會成為怎樣的人但事實上我們也會影響大腦的發展所以當她跟別人的互動越來越少在此同時這對她的心智及大腦都造成影響", "en": "So we feel sometimesthat the brain is deterministic, the brain determineswho we're going to be. But, in fact, the brainalso becomes who we are, and at the same timethat her behaviors are taking away from the realm of social interaction, this is what's happening with her mind, and this is what's happeningwith her brain."}, {"zh-tw": "自閉症是所有發展障礙中與基因關聯最強的一種它是一種腦部疾病", "en": "Well, autism is the most stronglygenetic condition of all developmental disorders. And it's a brain disorder."}, {"zh-tw": "是一種早在出生前就發生的疾病是一種早在出生前就發生的疾病我們現在知道了自閉症會以很多不同樣貌顯現", "en": "It's a disorder that beginsmuch prior to the time that the child is born. We now know that there is a verybroad spectrum of autism."}, {"zh-tw": "有些人有嚴重的智力障礙有些人則是有特殊的天份有些人完全不說話，有些人卻說個不停如果你到他們的學校去", "en": "There are those individualswho are profoundly intellectually disabled but there are those that are gifted. There are those individualswho don't talk at all; there are those individualswho talk too much."}, {"zh-tw": "你可能會看到有些人若未經制止會繞著學校的圍籬跑個不停有些人則會不斷試圖引起你的注意有些人則會不斷試圖引起你的注意但他們使用的方式通常讓人感到不舒服也無法引起別人共鳴這種狀況遠比我們當初想的要普遍當我剛踏入這個領域時", "en": "There are those individualsthat if you observe them in their school, you see them running the periphery fenceall the school day if you let them, to those individualswho cannot stop coming to you and trying to engage yourepeatedly, relentlessly, but often in an awkward fashion, without that immediate resonance. Well, this is much more prevalentthan we thought at the time."}, {"zh-tw": "我們認為每一萬人中約有四人患有自閉症算是一種很罕見的疾病現在我們知道大約每百人中就有一個", "en": "When I started in this field, we thought there were four individualswith autism per 10,000 -- a very rare condition. Well, now we know it's morelike one in 100."}, {"zh-tw": "我們周遭有幾百萬的人患有自閉症這種疾病的社會成本很大只在美國，也許就要花上350億到800億美金", "en": "There are millions of individualswith autism all around us. The societal costof this condition is huge, in the US alone,maybe 35 to 80 billion dollars."}, {"zh-tw": "而你們知道嗎？絕大多數的經費都被用在青少年及有嚴重障礙的成人身上他們需要非常密集的全方位服務他們需要非常密集的全方位服務每年就需要六到八萬美金以上的費用", "en": "And you know what? Most of those funds are associatedwith adolescents and particularly adults who are severely disabled, individuals who needwraparound services -- services that are very, very intensive. And those services can cost in excessof 60,000 to 80,000 dollars a year."}, {"zh-tw": "這些都是未從早期療育獲益的人因為我們現在知道，當他們的學習像我之前說的那樣走上另一條路時自閉症的狀況就會越加惡化如果我們能做到早期發現並且在早期就介入治療我告訴你們我們絕對可以減輕自閉症的症狀這個想法在過去十年裡改變了我的人生", "en": "Those are individuals who did notbenefit from early treatment, because now we knowthat autism creates itself as individuals diverge in that pathwayof learning that I mentioned to you. Were we to be ableto identify this condition at an earlier point,and intervene and treat -- I can tell you, this has been probablysomething that has changed my life in the past 10 years, this notion that we can absolutelyattenuate this condition."}, {"zh-tw": "但我們只有一小段時間可以採取行動因為大腦只在那一段時間裡有可塑性這段寶貴的時間是在三歲以前這段寶貴的時間是在三歲以前並不是說在那之後就完全沒有機會了", "en": "Also, we have a window of opportunity, because the brainis malleable for just so long, and that window of opportunityhappens in the first three years of life. It's not that that windowcloses; it doesn't."}, {"zh-tw": "但是機會確實大大降低目前在美國自閉症得到確診的平均年齡一般還是在五歲對於那些得不到臨床服務住在偏遠地區或身為少數族裔的弱勢族群來說確診的年齡還要更晚這幾乎像是我們對這些族群宣告他們的自閉症患者注定要陷入越來越嚴重的狀況", "en": "But it diminishes considerably. And yet, the median ageof diagnosis in this country is still about five years, and in disadvantaged populations, the populations that don't haveaccess to clinical services, rural populations, minorities, the age of diagnosis is later still, which is almost as if I were to tell you that we are condemning those communitiesto have individuals with autism whose condition is goingto be more severe."}, {"zh-tw": "就醫學倫理而言，我們有不可推卸的責任我們已經有這些科學知識", "en": "So I feel that we havea bioethical imperative. The science is there."}, {"zh-tw": "但如果它們不能為社會所用它們就沒有多大用處而我們不能失去這樣的機會因為患有自閉症的兒童會長大成人", "en": "But no science is of relevance if it doesn't have an impacton the community. And we just can't affordthat missed opportunity, because children with autismbecome adults with autism."}, {"zh-tw": "我們如果能夠及早盡我們所能為他們及他們的家庭做點事對這些家庭或整個社會來說都會有長遠的影響這就是我們對自閉症的看法", "en": "And we feel that those things we can do for these children,for those families, early on, will have lifetime consequences -- for the child, for the family,and for the community at large. So this is our view of autism."}, {"zh-tw": "跟自閉症有關的基因有上百個事實上我們相信可能有300到600個基因或基因異常與自閉症有關", "en": "There are over a hundred genesthat are associated with autism. In fact, we believe there are going to be something between 300 and 600genes associated with autism, and genetic anomalies,much more than just genes."}, {"zh-tw": "問題來了這麼多不同的不利因素到底是怎樣發展成自閉症的呢？因為當人們─　好比我自己走入一間遊戲室時我們可以分辨出一個孩子是不是有自閉症到底為什麼這麼多不同成因最後會導致這麼相似的症狀呢？原來答案在成因與呈現的症狀之間:也就是孩子的發育", "en": "And we actually havea bit of a question here, because if there are so manydifferent causes of autism, how do you go from those liabilitiesto the actual syndrome? Because people like myself, when we walk into a playroom, we recognize a child as having autism. So how do you go from multiple causes to a syndrome that has some homogeneity? And the answer is what lies in between, which is development."}, {"zh-tw": "事實上，我們對兩歲之前這段時間非常有興趣因為這些不利因素並不必然發展成自閉症因為這些不利因素並不必然發展成自閉症自閉症是自行形成", "en": "And in fact, we are very interestedin those first two years of life, because those liabilitiesdon't necessarily convert into autism. Autism creates itself."}, {"zh-tw": "如果我們能在兩歲之前就介入我們也許可以減輕一些孩子的症狀誰知道，我們說不定甚至可以預防它的發生但我們要怎麼做呢？我們要怎麼創造共鳴感？又要怎麼進入另一個人的世界呢？我記得在我跟那十五個月大的女孩互動時我心裡在想「要怎麼進入她的世界呢？」「她在想著我嗎？還是想著別人？」嗯，這有點難做到所以我們必須創造這樣的技術", "en": "Were we to be able to interveneduring those years of life, we might attenuate for some, and Godknows, maybe even prevent for others. So how do we do that? How do we enter that feeling of resonance, how do we enter another person's being? I remember when I interactedwith that 15-month-old, the thing that came to my mind was, \"How do you come into her world? Is she thinking about me?Is she thinking about others?\" Well, it's hard to do that, so we had to create the technologies."}, {"zh-tw": "好透過她的眼睛來看這個世界", "en": "We had to basically step inside a body. We had to see the world through her eyes."}, {"zh-tw": "所以過去幾年中我們都在發展這種以眼球追蹤為基礎的新技術我們可以每時每刻地看到什麼吸引了孩子的注意", "en": "And so in the past many years, we've been building these new technologies that are based on eye tracking. We can see, moment by moment,what children are engaging with."}, {"zh-tw": "這是我同事瓦倫 ‧ 瓊斯在過去十二年中我們一起做研究、發展這些方法這是一個快樂的男孩五個月大正要用眼睛去探索這個世界看看他媽媽、照顧他的人還有其他在托兒所裡可能看見的事物", "en": "This is my colleague, Warren Jones, with whom we've been buildingthese methods, these studies, for the past 12 years. And you see there a happy five-month-old, a five-month little boywho is going to watch things that are brought from his world: his mom, the caregiver, but also experiences that he would havewere he to be in his daycare."}, {"zh-tw": "我們想要做的是把他所經驗到的世界帶進我們的實驗室但要做到這點我們必須要能夠精密地測量人們以及嬰幼兒在每時每刻中是怎樣與這個世界互動什麼對他們來說是重要的什麼又是不重要的", "en": "What we want is to embrace that worldand bring it into our laboratory, but in order for us to do that, we had to createthese very sophisticated measures, measures of how people, how little babies, how newborns, engagewith the world, moment by moment. What is important and what is not."}, {"zh-tw": "我們發展出了一些評量方法這裡看到的是注意力的漏斗模型你們看到的是一段影片的紀錄每個影像的間距大概是一秒鐘這是35個正常發展的兩歲幼兒眼中所看到的世界", "en": "Well, we created those measures, and here, what you seeis what we call a funnel of attention. You're watching a video -- those frames are separatedby about a second -- through the eyes of 35 typicallydeveloping two-year-olds."}, {"zh-tw": "我們現在停在其中一刻這是正常發展的兩歲幼兒在做的事綠色的這些則是有自閉症的孩子做的事", "en": "And we freeze one frame, and this is what the typicalchildren are doing. In this scan pass, in green here,are two-year-olds with autism."}, {"zh-tw": "所以在那一刻正常的孩子在看這個一個小男孩在跟一個小女孩吵架所表現出的情緒反應有自閉症的孩子又在做些什麼呢？他們專心地看著旋轉門開開關關他們專心地看著旋轉門開開關關", "en": "So on that frame, the childrenwho are typical are watching this, the emotion of expressionof that little boy as he's fighting a little bitwith the little girl. What are the children with autism doing? They are focusing on the revolving door, opening and shutting."}, {"zh-tw": "我可以告訴你們你們所看到的這些差異並不只發生在我們進行實驗的五分鐘裡他們真實生活裡的每時每刻都是這樣的而他們的心智隨之成形他們的大腦也以與其他孩子不同的方式成長", "en": "Well, I can tell you that this divergencethat you're seeing here doesn't happen onlyin our five-minute experiment. It happens moment by momentin their real lives, and their minds are being formedand their brains are being specialized in something other than what is happeningwith their typical peers."}, {"zh-tw": "我們從當小兒科醫生的朋友處我們從當小兒科醫生的朋友處借用了生長曲線圖的概念當你帶小孩去看小兒科醫生時你可以由此得知他的身高體重所以我們決定要做出社交發展的曲線圖來", "en": "Well, we took a constructfrom our pediatrician friends, the concept of growth charts -- you know, when you takea child to the pediatrician, and you have physical height and weight. Well, we decided we were goingto create growth charts of social engagement."}, {"zh-tw": "我們徵求新生兒來參與研究在這X軸上是以月來看從兩個月到24個月", "en": "We sought childrenfrom the time they're born. What you see here on the x-axis is two, three, four, five,six months and nine, until about the age of 24 months."}, {"zh-tw": "這是他們盯著人眼看的時間百分比這是他們盯著人眼看的時間百分比這就是他們的發展曲線圖他們一開始就喜歡看著別人的眼睛這點一直沒有改變", "en": "This is the percent of their viewing time that they're focusing on people's eyes, and this is their growth chart. They start over here --they love people's eyes -- and it remains quite stable."}, {"zh-tw": "在最初的幾個月中它還上升了一點現在讓我們看看後來被診斷出自閉症的孩子的發展曲線", "en": "It sort of goes up a little bitin those initial months. Now, let's see what's happeningwith babies who became autistic."}, {"zh-tw": "它看起來就很不一樣了它一開始在上面這邊，再來就一直下降", "en": "It's something very different. It starts way up here,but then it's a free fall."}, {"zh-tw": "就像他們生來具有追尋他人的本能但這本能無法持續下去這幾乎像是「你」作為一個外界刺激在他們探索日常生活的過程中無足輕重", "en": "It's very much like they broughtinto this world the reflex that orients them to people,but it has no traction. It's almost as if that stimulus -- you -- you're not exertinginfluence on what happens as they navigate their daily lives."}, {"zh-tw": "這些資料讓我們很想看看出生後六個月的期間發生了什麼事因為如果你試著跟兩、三個月大的嬰兒互動因為如果你試著跟兩、三個月大的嬰兒互動你會訝異他們是多麼善於與人接觸我們在這頭六個月中所看到的是這兩組嬰兒有非常明顯的分別", "en": "Now, we thought those datawere so powerful, in a way, that we wanted to see what happenedin the first six months of life, because if you interactwith a two- and a three-month-old, you'd be surprisedby how social those babies are. And what we seein the first six months of life is that those two groupscan be segregated very easily."}, {"zh-tw": "運用這些或者其他各類的測量方法我們發現現代科學事實上可以做到早期發現這些狀況我們不用等到兩歲來看自閉症的行為是否出現", "en": "And using these kindsof measures and many others, what we found outis that our science could, in fact, identify this condition early on. We didn't have to waitfor the behaviors of autism to emerge in the second year of life."}, {"zh-tw": "如果我們測量那些演化上保存下來的在早期發展就會出現的東西那些在出生後頭幾周就應該發生的事我們就能把診斷自閉症的時間提早到出生後頭幾個月這就是我們現在在做的是的，我們可以發展出最好的科技最好的方法來找出這些孩子但如果我們不能改變他們所處的現實環境這些都是徒勞無功", "en": "If we measured things that are,evolutionarily, highly conserved, and developmentally very early-emerging -- things that are onlinefrom the first weeks of life -- we could push the detection of autism all the way to those first months, and that's what we are doing now. Now, we can createthe very best technologies and the very best methodsto identify the children, but this would be for naughtif we didn't have an impact on what happens in their realityin the community."}, {"zh-tw": "當然我們會希望這些工具能被送到那些第一線工作人員的手中我們的同業還有那些負責替孩子們看診的醫生我們必須要把這些科技轉變成能在實務上發揮價值的東西因為他們必須面對很多的孩子我們希望把它變成一個普遍性的措施不要漏失任何一個孩子", "en": "Now we want those devices, of course, to be deployed by thosewho are in the trenches -- our colleagues, the primary carephysicians, who see every child -- and we need to transformthose technologies into something that is goingto add value to their practice, because they have to see so many children. And we want to do that universallyso that we don't miss any child."}, {"zh-tw": "但如果我們沒有介入及治療的配套措施但如果我們沒有介入及治療的配套措施這就會是不道德的我們必須要和這些家庭一起合作去支持他們度過頭幾年的時間我們必須從普遍性的篩選", "en": "But this would be immoral if we also did not have an infrastructurefor intervention, for treatment. We need to be able to workwith the families, support the families, to manage those first years with them."}, {"zh-tw": "做到普遍性的治療因為這些治療將會改變這些孩子以及他們家人的人生一想到在這生命的頭幾年中我們能夠做些什麼我告訴你即使在這領域工作了這麼久我還是感到充滿了幹勁", "en": "We need to be able to really go from universal screeningto universal access to treatment, because those treatmentsare going to change these children'sand those families' lives. Now, when we think about what we [can]do in those first years, I can tell you, having beenin this field for so long, one feels really rejuvenated."}, {"zh-tw": "覺得我所鑽研的科學能夠真正有所貢獻讓其他人不會再有我初踏入這領域時的那種經驗那時我以為這是沒法治療的症狀", "en": "There is a sense that the sciencethat one worked on can actually have an impact on realities, preventing, in fact, those experiences that I really startedin my journey in this field. I thought at the timethat this was an intractable condition."}, {"zh-tw": "不再是這樣了，我們有很多事可以做但重點並不在治癒自閉症", "en": "No longer. We can doa great deal of things. And the idea is not to cure autism."}, {"zh-tw": "不是的我們是想讓那些患有自閉症的人可以不必承受它的嚴重後果─可以不必承受它的嚴重後果─嚴重的智力障礙、語言發展的缺乏以及全然地封閉", "en": "That's not the idea. What we want is to make sure that those individualswith autism can be free from the devastating consequencesthat come with it at times, the profound intellectual disabilities,the lack of language, the profound, profound isolation."}, {"zh-tw": "我們認為自閉症患者事實上擁有很特別的世界觀我們的社會需要多元性而他們可以在穩定、明確的狀況下發揮他們的長處", "en": "We feel that individualswith autism, in fact, have a very specialperspective on the world, and we need diversity. And they can work extremely wellin some areas of strength: predictable situations,situations that can be defined."}, {"zh-tw": "畢竟他們專注於了解世界本來的面貌而不是學習如何生活其中如果你在科技業工作這就是項長處", "en": "Because after all,they learn about the world almost, like, about it, rather than learninghow to function in it.
