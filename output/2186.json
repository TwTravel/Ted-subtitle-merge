It's because the teacherwas awful.\" Or B) \"But what is math really for?\" I'll now address Case B."}, {"zh-tw": "當有人問你數學是什麼，他們不是問你有關數學的科學應用。他們是問你，為什麼我要學習一生都不會用到的廢物科目？ (笑聲）這就是他們實際上問的。", "en": "When someone asks you what math is for,they're not asking you about applicationsof mathematical science. They're asking you, why did I have to study that bullshitI never used in my life again? That's what they're actually asking."}, {"zh-tw": "所以，當數學家被問到數學是做什麼的，它們傾向於分為兩類：54.51%的數學家將採取進攻的姿態，而44.77％的數學家將採防禦的姿態。還有奇怪的0.8％，其中包括我自己。誰是那些採取攻擊姿態的人?", "en": "So when mathematicians are askedwhat math is for, they tend to fall into two groups: 54.51 percent of mathematicianswill assume an attacking position, and 44.77 percent of mathematicianswill take a defensive position. There's a strange 0.8 percent,among which I include myself."}, {"zh-tw": "採取攻擊姿態的數學家會告訴你這個問題是沒有意義的，因為數學有其自身的意義 -像是一個美麗的大廈有它自己的邏輯 -而且不斷尋找所有可能的應用是沒有意義的。詩歌有什麼用？愛有什麼用？生活本身有什麼用？這是什麼樣的問題呢？(笑聲）例如，哈迪，就是一個遭受這種攻擊的典型。那些採防禦姿的態會告訴你，", "en": "Who are the ones that attack? The attacking ones are mathematicianswho would tell you this question makes no sense, because mathematicshave a meaning all their own -- a beautiful edifice with its own logic -- and that there's no point in constantly searchingfor all possible applications. What's the use of poetry?What's the use of love? What's the use of life itself? What kind of question is that? Hardy, for instance, was a modelof this type of attack."}, {"zh-tw": "“即使你沒有意識到這一點，朋友，數學是所有東西背後的一切。”(笑聲）那些人，他們總是提到橋樑和電腦。“如果你不知道數學，您的大橋將會倒塌。”(笑聲）這是真的，電腦跟數學密切相關。", "en": "And those who stand in defense tell you, \"Even if you don't realize it, friend,math is behind everything.\" Those guys, they always bring upbridges and computers. \"If you don't know math,your bridge will collapse.\" It's true, computers are all about math."}, {"zh-tw": "而現在這些人也開始說，在電腦資訊安全和信用卡背後就是質數。這也就是你的數學老師會給你的答案。", "en": "And now these guyshave also started saying that behind information securityand credit cards are prime numbers. These are the answers your math teacherwould give you if you asked him."}, {"zh-tw": "他也是採防禦姿態的成員之一。好了，但到底誰是對的呢？是那些說數學並不需要有一個目的，還是那些說數學在我們所做的一切中？其實上，雙方都是是正確的。", "en": "He's one of the defensive ones. Okay, but who's right then? Those who say that mathdoesn't need to have a purpose, or those who say that mathis behind everything we do? Actually, both are right."}, {"zh-tw": "但請記住我告訴你的我屬於那奇怪自稱別的0.8％嗎？因此，再問我一次數學是做什麼的。觀眾：數學是做什麼的？好吧，你們中76.34％的人問了這個問題，23.41％的人什麼也沒有說，和剩下的0.8％ ，我不知道那些人在做什麼。", "en": "But remember I told you I belong to that strange 0.8 percentclaiming something else? So, go ahead, ask me what math is for. Audience: What is math for? Eduardo Sáenz de Cabezón: Okay,76.34 percent of you asked the question, 23.41 percent didn't say anything, and the 0.8 percent -- I'm not sure what those guys are doing."}, {"zh-tw": "好吧，我那親愛的76.31％的觀眾，數學真的不需要有一個目的，它真的是有一個美麗且有邏輯的結構，而這也可能是人類在歷史上集體努力實現的成就之一。但這也是真的：當科學家和技術人員在尋找使他們能進步的數學理論時，他們是在無處不在的數學結構中工作。", "en": "Well, to my dear 76.31 percent -- it's true that math doesn't needto serve a purpose, it's true that it'sa beautiful structure, a logical one, probably oneof the greatest collective efforts ever achieved in human history. But it's also true that there, where scientists and techniciansare looking for mathematical theories that allow them to advance, they're within the structure of math,which permeates everything."}, {"zh-tw": "這是真的，我們必須去深入了解，才能明白科學。科學在直覺和創造力上運作。", "en": "It's true that we have to gosomewhat deeper, to see what's behind science. Science operates on intuition, creativity."}, {"zh-tw": "而數學控制直覺及馴服創造力。幾乎每個沒有聽說過這個之前會覺得驚訝。當他們聽到如果你拿個我們通常使用的0.1毫米厚紙片，而且，如果它夠大，把它折疊50次，它的厚度幾乎可以從地球延伸到太陽。", "en": "Math controls intuitionand tames creativity. Almost everyonewho hasn't heard this before is surprised when they hearthat if you take a 0.1 millimeter thick sheet of paper,the size we normally use, and, if it were big enough,fold it 50 times, its thickness would extend almostthe distance from the Earth to the sun."}, {"zh-tw": "你的直覺告訴你這是不可能的。但數學告訴你它是正確的。", "en": "Your intuition tells you it's impossible. Do the math and you'll see it's right."}, {"zh-tw": "這就是數學的作用了。這是真的，科學，各類科學的意義在於因為它使我們更好地理解我們生活的這個美麗的世界。", "en": "That's what math is for. It's true that science, all typesof science, only makes sense because it makes us better understandthis beautiful world we live in."}, {"zh-tw": "而這樣做，它可以幫助我們在我們居住的這個痛苦的世界裡避免重蹈覆轍。有些科學可以直接幫助我們。", "en": "And in doing that, it helps us avoid the pitfallsof this painful world we live in. There are sciences that help usin this way quite directly."}, {"zh-tw": "例如，腫瘤學。而且還有其他我們有時帶著羨慕眼光從遠方觀看的科學，但我們知道，我們是支持它們的。", "en": "Oncological science, for example. And there are others we look at from afar,with envy sometimes, but knowing that we arewhat supports them."}, {"zh-tw": "所有的基礎科學都支持它們，包括數學。所有這一切創造科學，而數學是科學的嚴謹性。", "en": "All the basic sciencessupport them, including math. All that makes science, scienceis the rigor of math."}, {"zh-tw": "嚴謹是最重要的因素因為它的結果是永恆的。你可能在某些時候說過，或被告知，鑽石是永恆的，對不對？這取決於你對永恆的定義！一個數學定理真的是永恆的。", "en": "And that rigor factors inbecause its results are eternal. You probably said or were toldat some point that diamonds are forever, right? That depends onyour definition of forever! A theorem -- that really is forever."}, {"zh-tw": "即使畢達哥拉斯死了，畢氏定理仍然是正確的，我保證。即使世界坍塌畢氏定理仍然是真的。", "en": "The Pythagorean theorem is still true even though Pythagoras is dead,I assure you it's true. Even if the world collapsed the Pythagorean theoremwould still be true."}, {"zh-tw": "只要任意兩個直角三角形邊和合適的斜邊連在一起畢氏定理就能用。它真是太有用了。好了，我們的數學家貢獻終身想出定理。", "en": "Wherever any two triangle sidesand a good hypotenuse get together the Pythagorean theorem goes all out.It works like crazy. Well, we mathematicians devote ourselvesto come up with theorems."}, {"zh-tw": "永恆的真理。但並不總是容易知道它是一個永恆的真理，或定理，或是單純的猜想。", "en": "Eternal truths. But it isn't always easy to knowthe difference between an eternal truth, or theorem,and a mere conjecture."}, {"zh-tw": "你需要證明。例如，我有一個大的，巨大的，無限領域。", "en": "You need proof. For example, let's say I have a big,enormous, infinite field."}, {"zh-tw": "我想以同樣的物件覆蓋它，不留空隙。我可以用正方形，對不對？我可以用三角形。但不能用圓形，因為那會留下小缺口。", "en": "I want to cover it with equal pieces,without leaving any gaps. I could use squares, right? I could use triangles.Not circles, those leave little gaps."}, {"zh-tw": "用那個形狀是最好的？一個覆蓋相同的表面，但具有較小邊的。在公元300年，帕普斯說，最好是用六邊形，就像蜜蜂用的。", "en": "Which is the best shape to use? One that covers the same surface,but has a smaller border. In the year 300, Pappus of Alexandriasaid the best is to use hexagons, just like bees do."}, {"zh-tw": "但他並沒有證明它。這傢伙說，“六邊形，太棒了！讓我們用六邊形！“他沒有提供證明，所以它仍然只是一個猜想。", "en": "But he didn't prove it. The guy said, \"Hexagons, great!Let's go with hexagons!\" He didn't prove it,it remained a conjecture."}, {"zh-tw": "“六邊形”！而這世界，你也知道，分成帕普斯幫和反帕普斯幫，直到1700年後在公元1999年，托馬斯·黑爾斯證明了帕普斯和蜜蜂是正確的，最好的形狀是六邊形。而這也成為一個定理，蜂窩定理，而它將是真的，直到永遠，比任何你擁有的鑽石活的更久遠。", "en": "\"Hexagons!\" And the world, as you know,split into Pappists and anti-Pappists, until 1700 years later when in 1999, Thomas Hales proved that Pappus and the bees were right --the best shape to use was the hexagon. And that became a theorem,the honeycomb theorem, that will be true forever and ever, for longer than any diamondyou may have."}, {"zh-tw": "但是，當我們來到三度空間時要怎麼辦？如果我想以相同的物件填補空間，不留空隙，我可以使用立方體，對不對？不能用球體，那會留下小缺口。什麼形狀是最好的？以克氏溫標聞名的克爾文爵士，說，最好使用截角八面體因為，因為大家都知道就是這個東西！", "en": "But what happens if we goto three dimensions? If I want to fill the spacewith equal pieces, without leaving any gaps, I can use cubes, right? Not spheres, those leave little gaps. What is the best shape to use? Lord Kelvin, of the famousKelvin degrees and all, said that the best was to usea truncated octahedron which, as you all know -- -- is this thing here! Come on."}, {"zh-tw": "拜託。誰家沒有截角八面體？即使是塑膠的。“親愛的，去拿截角八面體，我們有客人來了。“每個人都有！但克爾文並沒有證明它。", "en": "Who doesn't have a truncatedoctahedron at home? Even a plastic one. \"Honey, get the truncated octahedron,we're having guests.\" Everybody has one! But Kelvin didn't prove it."}, {"zh-tw": "它仍然是一個猜想 - 克爾文的猜想。而這世界，你也知道，分成克爾文幫和反克爾文幫，直到一百年多年後，有人找到了更好的立方體。", "en": "It remained a conjecture --Kelvin's conjecture. The world, as you know, then split intoKelvinists and anti-Kelvinists until a hundred or so years later, someone found a better structure."}, {"zh-tw": "Weaire和Phelan發現了這個小東西 -他們給這種立方結構取了個非常聰明的名字就是“Weaire - Phelan的結構”。它看起來像一個奇怪的物體，但它不是那麼的陌生，因為它也存在於自然界。這種結構是非常有趣的，因為它的幾何特性，被用來在北京奧運會設計游泳中心。", "en": "Weaire and Phelanfound this little thing over here -- -- this structure to which they gavethe very clever name \"the Weaire-Phelan structure.\" It looks like a strange object,but it isn't so strange, it also exists in nature. It's very interesting that this structure, because of its geometric properties, was used to build the Aquatics Centerfor the Beijing Olympic Games."}, {"zh-tw": "在那裡，菲爾普斯贏得了八面奧運金牌，並成為有史以來最好的游泳運動員。好吧，直到有人發現更好的結構，對不對？就像是Weaire - Phelan結構。", "en": "There, Michael Phelpswon eight gold medals, and became the best swimmer of all time. Well, until someone bettercomes along, right? As may happenwith the Weaire-Phelan structure."}, {"zh-tw": "直到更好的東西出現。但注意，因為這個是很有可能的在100年左右，或者是在1700年後，有人會證明這是最好的結構。", "en": "It's the bestuntil something better shows up. But be careful, because this onereally stands a chance that in a hundred or so years,or even if it's in 1700 years, that someone provesit's the best possible shape for the job."}, {"zh-tw": "然後，它會成為一個定理，一個真理，直到永遠。比鑽石活得更久。", "en": "It will then become a theorem,a truth, forever and ever. For longer than any diamond."}, {"zh-tw": "所以，如果你想告訴別人你會永遠愛他們，你可以給他們鑽石。但是，如果你要告訴他們，你一定會永永遠遠的喜歡他們，給他們一個定理！等一下！你必須要證明它，讓你的愛不只是一個猜想。", "en": "So, if you want to tell someone that you will love them forever you can give them a diamond. But if you want to tell themthat you'll love them forever and ever, give them a theorem! But hang on a minute! You'll have to prove it, so your love doesn't remain a conjecture."}], "title": "Eduardo Saenz De Cabezon Math Is Forever"}
