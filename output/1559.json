Settlements typically beganwith people clustered around a well, and the size of that settlementwas roughly the distance you could walk with a pot of water on your head. In fact, if you flyover Germany, for example, and you look down and you seethese hundreds of little villages, they're all about a mile apart."}, {"zh-tw": "你必須能方便的到田裡工作過去數百年，甚至是過去數千年家就是生活的中心", "en": "You needed easy access to the fields. And for hundreds, even thousands of years, the home was really the center of life."}, {"zh-tw": "對大部分的人們而言，生活範圍很小家就是娛樂中心，能源生產中心，工作中心，照護中心", "en": "Life was very small for most people. It was a center of entertainment,of energy production, of work, a center of health care."}, {"zh-tw": "那裡也是寶寶出生、親人去世的地方之後，隨著工業革命發展，所有的東西都開始集中化", "en": "That's where babies were bornand people died. Then, with industrialization,everything started to become centralized."}, {"zh-tw": "骯髒的工廠移到城市外圍貨物集中在裝配工廠中製造", "en": "You had dirty factories that were movedto the outskirts of cities. Production was centralizedin assembly plants."}, {"zh-tw": "能源生產也集中化學習要到學校。醫療照護", "en": "You had centralized energy production. Learning took place in schools."}, {"zh-tw": "則移到了醫院然後各式網路發展起來", "en": "Health care took place in hospitals. And then you had networks that developed."}, {"zh-tw": "送水及污水渠道使人們得以無限制擴張領域分工現象愈來愈多", "en": "You had water, sewer networks that allowed for thiskind of unchecked expansion. You had separated functions, increasingly."}, {"zh-tw": "火車把住宅區工業區及商業區連起來。你也有了公路系統", "en": "You had rail networks that connected residential,industrial, commercial areas. You had auto networks."}, {"zh-tw": "事實上，過去的模式的確是給每人一輛車造公路到每個地方，而且讓人們到了目的地後有個地方可以停車。這並不是功能很好的模式", "en": "In fact, the model was really,give everybody a car, build roads to everything, and give people a place to parkwhen they get there. It was not a very functional model."}, {"zh-tw": "但我們仍然生活在這樣的模式裡而這就是這種發展模式的結果這是向四面八方無限蔓延的洛杉磯市向四面八方無限蔓延的墨西哥市", "en": "And we still live in that world, and this is what we end up with. So you have the sprawl of LA, the sprawl of Mexico City."}, {"zh-tw": "還有這些令人難以置信的中國新都市你或許可以稱這些為向天空無限蔓延的巨塔他們正以我們在50及60年代所發展的模式來建造都市，我要說這模式真的很過時了而全球還有成百上千的新都市開發計劃", "en": "You have these unbelievablenew cities in China, which you might call tower sprawl. They're all building cities on the model that we inventedin the '50s and '60s, which is really obsolete, I would argue, and there are hundredsand hundreds of new cities that are being planned all over the world."}, {"zh-tw": "僅在中國，就有三億人口有人說是四億人口會在未來15年內遷徙到都市這意味著中國要在15年內建立相當於美國整體的基礎建設", "en": "In China alone, 300 million people,some say 400 million people, will move to the cityover the next 15 years. That means building the equivalent of the entire built infrastructureof the US in 15 years."}, {"zh-tw": "可以想像嗎？我們都應該對此關心不論你住在都市與否", "en": "Imagine that. And we should all care about thiswhether you live in cities or not."}, {"zh-tw": "都市要對90%的人口成長80%的全球二氧化碳排放量，75%的能源使用負責任但同時，都市也是人們愈來愈想去的地方現在，全球一半以上的人住在都市裡而且人數還會逐步上升", "en": "Cities will account for 90 percentof the population growth, 80 percent of the global CO2,75 percent of energy use, but at the same timeit's where people want to be, increasingly.

That's a lot of the reasonwhy cities are growing very quickly."}, {"zh-tw": "那麼，有一些趨勢會影響都市發展首先，工作變得分散並且機動性高", "en": "Now there's some trendsthat will impact cities. First of all, work is becomingdistributed and mobile."}, {"zh-tw": "在辦公大樓內做私人工作基本上已經過時了「家」再度因為分散式計算，即通訊設備而變成生活的中心所以家是製造、學習、購物醫療，及其他我們原本已經習慣要在家以外發生的事情的中心", "en": "The office building is basically obsoletefor doing private work. The home, once again,because of distributed computation -- Communication is becominga center of life, so it's a center of productionand learning and shopping and health care and all of these thingsthat we used to think of as taking place outside of the home."}, {"zh-tw": "而且人們想辦法把買的每一樣物品每一種消費產品個人化的現象也愈來愈多這是值得思考的重要趨勢", "en": "And increasingly,everything that people buy, every consumer product, in one way or another,can be personalized. And that's a very importanttrend to think about."}, {"zh-tw": "所以這是我想像中的未來城市的樣子因為都市是一個「人」的地方，你知道", "en": "So this is my imageof the city of the future. In that it's a place for people, you know."}, {"zh-tw": "大家大概不會穿成這樣，但是 --你知道真正的問題是我們要如何保有我們認為都市應該有的好東西而除去那些不好的事情？這是班加羅爾。去年我在那裡要花好幾個小時才能在班加羅爾街上移動數哩遠", "en": "Maybe not the way people dress, but -- You know, the question now is, how can we have all the good thingsthat we identify with cities without all the bad things? This is Bangalore. It took me a couple of hoursto get a few miles in Bangalore last year."}, {"zh-tw": "所以有了都市，你也就有了交通阻塞及汙染疾病，及那些不好的東西我們要如何去蕪存菁？所以我們回溯歷史，並且開始研究那些在汽車發展前就很偉大的城市", "en": "So with cities, you also havecongestion and pollution and disease and all these negative things. How can we have the good stuffwithout the bad? So we went back and started lookingat the great cities that evolved before the cars."}, {"zh-tw": "巴黎是由一系列的小村莊組合起來的，至今你仍然能看到這個結構巴黎的20區就是由這些小社區組成的", "en": "Paris was a series of theselittle villages that came together, and you still see that structure today. The 20 arrondissements of Parisare these little neighborhoods."}, {"zh-tw": "人們生活所需的大部分物品都能在步行5到10分鐘之內買到如果你研究一下數據，你會發現在巴黎因為這樣的組成結構，你會看到分佈平均的商店、診所及藥局及餐館", "en": "Most of what people need in lifecan be within a five- or 10-minute walk. And if you look at the data,when you have that kind of a structure, you get a very even distribution of the shops and the physiciansand the pharmacies and the cafes in Paris."}, {"zh-tw": "然後你看看那些在車子發明之後才發展出的城市，不走這種模式大部份像匹茲堡這樣的地方，很少有步行五分鐘之內能到的商店", "en": "And then you look at citiesthat evolved after the automobile, and it's not that kind of a pattern. There's very littlethat's within a five-minute walk of most areas of places like Pittsburgh."}, {"zh-tw": "我不是故意要挑匹茲堡，但是大部分的美國城市的確是以這種模式發展所以我們說，我們會，讓我們看看新都市目前我們正參與幾個中國的都市發展計劃", "en": "Not to pick on Pittsburgh, but most American citiesreally have evolved this way. So we said, well,let's look at new cities, and we're involved in a coupleof new city projects in China."}, {"zh-tw": "所以我們說，讓我們從發展細胞社區開始我們把這視為小型的都會細胞社區", "en": "So we said, let's startwith that neighborhood cell. We think of it as a compact urban cell."}, {"zh-tw": "它在步行20分鐘地區內提供多數人想要的東西這同時也是一個動態輸電微網社區暖氣供應站、電力供應站、通訊網路站", "en": "So provide most of what most people wantwithin that 20-minute walk. This can also bea resilient electrical microgrid, community heating, power,communication networks, etc."}, {"zh-tw": "等等設施都可以集中在此（美國環保運動先驅）斯圖爾特•布蘭德可能會放一個微核子反應器在這個小細胞的中心", "en": "can be concentrated there. Stewart Brand would puta micronuclear reactor right in the center, probably."}, {"zh-tw": "很有可能喔！如此我們可以形成一個實際網狀網路", "en": "And he might be right. And then we can form,in effect, a mesh network."}, {"zh-tw": "很像網際網路類型學的模式所以你可以有一系列這樣子的小社區你可以增加細胞社區人口密度--如果是劍橋，就增大到可容納二萬人。如果是曼哈頓", "en": "It's something of an Internettypology pattern, so you can have a seriesof these neighborhoods. You can dial up the density -- about 20,000 people per cell,if it's Cambridge."}, {"zh-tw": "就增大到五萬人。你把所有的東西用大眾運輸連起來，而且你在細胞社區內提供大多數人所需之物品", "en": "Go up to 50,000 if it's Manhattan density. You connect everything with mass transit and you provide most of what most peopleneed within that neighborhood."}, {"zh-tw": "你可以開始發展一整套街道景觀類型學並且設定什麼車子可以通過。我不要講所有細節我舉一個例就好", "en": "You can begin to developa whole typology of streetscapes and the vehicles that can go on them. I won't go through all of them.I'll just show one."}, {"zh-tw": "這是博爾德市。這是個「移動林蔭大道」的好例子一條給慢跑者及單車客的「高速公路」讓你可以從城市的這一端走到另一端不需要穿越馬路，而且他們還有個單車共享計劃等一下我會談這個在南韓首爾這個解決方案更有趣", "en": "This is Boulder. It's a great exampleof kind of a mobility parkway, a superhighway for joggers and bicyclists, where you can go from one endof the city to the other without crossing the street, and they also have bike-sharing,which I'll get into in a minute. This is even a more interesting solution in Seoul, Korea."}, {"zh-tw": "他們把原有的高架道路拆掉復原地面街道，在底下的暗渠變為明渠所以河流在街道底下，你可以從首爾的這一端走到另一端，不用穿過車道曼哈頓的 Highline（重整廢棄高架鐵道）也很類似", "en": "They took the elevated highway,they got rid of it, they reclaimed the street,the river down below, below the street, and you can go from one endof Seoul to the other without crossing a pathway for cars. The High Line in Manhattanis very similar."}, {"zh-tw": "這些快速興起的自行車道在全世界盛行。我曾在曼哈頓住過15年", "en": "You have these rapidly emergingbike lanes all over the world. I lived in Manhattan for 15 years."}, {"zh-tw": "前幾個星期我回去看了一下，照了這張照片他們蓋了幾條非常棒的新自行車道但是仍然比不上哥本哈根，在那裡大約百分之四十二的城內旅行是騎腳踏車完成。主要是因為他們有", "en": "I went back a couple of weekends ago, took this photograph of these fabulousnew bike lanes that they have installed. They're still not to where Copenhagen is, where something like 42 percentof the trips within the city are by bicycle."}, {"zh-tw": "非常棒的基礎建設我們其實也在波士頓作了件同樣的蠢事", "en": "It's mostly just because they havefantastic infrastructure there. We actually did exactlythe wrong thing in Boston."}, {"zh-tw": "我們--這個「大隧道計畫」（Big Dig）--所以我們把高速公路拆掉，卻蓋了一個安全島很肯定這條「移動大道」除了車以外，沒有東西能在上面移動「隨選自由行」是我們一直在想的東西所以我們認為我們需要一個生態系統把這些共享車輛與大眾運輸系統連起來", "en": "The Big Dig -- So we got rid of the highwaybut we created a traffic island, and it's certainly not a mobility pathwayfor anything other than cars. Mobility on demand is somethingwe've been thinking about, so we think we need an ecosystemof these shared-use vehicles connected to mass transit."}, {"zh-tw": "這些是我們一直在設計的車輛種類但是真正的關鍵是共享。如果你有一部車", "en": "These are some of the vehiclesthat we've been working on. But shared use is really key."}, {"zh-tw": "你可以讓至少四人乘坐而不是一個人開在波士頓我們有Hubway；在巴黎叫Vélib' （均為單車共享租用計劃）", "en": "If you share a vehicle, you can haveat least four people use one vehicle, as opposed to one. We have Hubway here in Boston,the Vélib' system in Paris."}, {"zh-tw": "我們在麻省理工的媒體實驗室計劃這個小小的車子，專門設計給都市人共享我們把那些沒用的東西拿掉，像是引擎", "en": "We've been developing,at the Media Lab, this little city car that is optimizedfor shared use in cities. We got rid of all the useless thingslike engines and transmissions."}, {"zh-tw": "排檔等等。我們把所有的東西都移到輪子上所以驅動馬達、駕駛馬達還有剎車都在輪子上這樣底盤就不受限制。你可以做像是摺疊這樣的事，所以你可以把這個小車子折起來這樣就只佔一個小小的空間", "en": "We moved everything to the wheels, so you have the drive motor, the steering motor, the breaking --all in the wheel. That left the chassis unencumbered,so you can do things like fold, so you can fold this little vehicle upto occupy a tiny little footprint."}, {"zh-tw": "這是上星期在歐洲電視上放的一段影片展示西班牙工業部長駕駛這個小車，這個車折起來後還會轉圈圈你不需要預訂，不需要路邊停車", "en": "This was a video that wason European television last week showing the Spanish Minister of Industrydriving this little vehicle, and when it's folded, it can spin. You don't need reverse.You don't need parallel parking."}, {"zh-tw": "你只要轉一轉它然後直直停進去所以我們一直在與一家公司合作", "en": "You just spin and go directly in. So we've been workingwith a company to commercialize this."}, {"zh-tw": "要量產上市這部車。我的博士班學生秦來恩（Ryan Chin）曾在二年前的TEDx研討會上發表過本計畫早期的發展所以有趣的是，如果你開始在上面加新東西，像是自動化程式，你下了車你停在你的目的地後，拍拍它的屁股它可以自己去停車，還會自己充電你可以讓比原來多七倍的車輛停在一個普通停車場裡而我們認為這是未來的展望。其實今天就可以這麼做", "en": "My PhD student Ryan Chinpresented these early ideas two years ago at a TEDx conference. So what's interesting is, then if you begin to addnew things to it, like autonomy, you get out of the car,you park at your destination, you pat it on the butt, it goesand it parks itself, it charges itself, and you can get somethinglike seven times as many vehicles in a given area as conventional cars, and we think this is the future."}, {"zh-tw": "這真的不是什麼問題我們可以結合共享、折疊及自動化使用這種策略我們可以讓土地使用增加28倍", "en": "Actually, we could do this today.It's not really a problem. We can combine shared useand folding and autonomy and we get somethinglike 28 times the land utilization with that kind of strategy."}, {"zh-tw": "然後我們有一個研究生說，嗯一部無人駕駛的車子要怎麼跟行人溝通？沒人在上面跟你眼神接觸你不知道這玩意是不是要輾過你", "en": "One of our graduate students then says, well, how does a driverless carcommunicate with pedestrians? You have nobody to make eye contact with. You don't knowif it's going to run you over."}, {"zh-tw": "所以他在發展一些策略，讓這部車子可以跟行人溝通，所以 --所以車頭燈是眼珠，瞳孔會放大我們有定向的音訊，可以直接對著人播放聲音我喜歡這個計劃，因為他未雨稠繆這問題基本上還不存在。所以我們也認為這種車可以讓自行車道的使用更民主化", "en": "So he's developing strategies so the vehicle can communicatewith pedestrians, so -- So the headlights are eyeballs,the pupils can dilate, we have directional audio,we can throw sound directly at people. What I love about this project is he solved a problemthat doesn't exist yet, so -- We also think that we candemocratize access to bike lanes."}, {"zh-tw": "你知道，自行車道的使用者大部分都是年輕人穿著緊身褲，你知道，所以 --我們認為我們可以發展一種車子可以在單車道上駕駛，老人及殘障者皆可使用穿裙子的女人、商人都可以，並且同時解決能源擁塞、行動力、老化及肥胖問題那是我們的挑戰", "en": "You know, bike lanes are mostly usedby young guys in stretchy pants. So -- We think we can develop a vehiclethat operates on bike lanes, accessible to elderly and disabled,women in skirts, businesspeople, and address the issuesof energy congestion, mobility, aging and obesity simultaneously. That's our challenge."}, {"zh-tw": "這是這個小三輪車的原型它是輛電動單車，你得踩踏板", "en": "This is an early designfor this little three-wheel. It's an electronic bike."}, {"zh-tw": "才能在騎在單車道上，但如果你是位老人家那裡有個開關轉成電動。如果你很健康你得非常努力的踩才能騎快", "en": "You have to pedalto operate it in a bike lane, but if you're an older person,that's a switch. If you're a healthy person, you mighthave to work really hard to go fast."}, {"zh-tw": "你可以設定去上班時消耗40卡回家時500卡，因為回家可以洗澡我們希望能在這個秋天製造出來", "en": "You can dial in 40 caloriesgoing into work and 500 going home,when you can take a shower. We hope to have that built this fall."}, {"zh-tw": "住宅是另一個還有進步空間的地方波士頓市長馬尼諾說，缺乏年輕人買的起的房子是本市面臨的最大困難之一", "en": "Housing is another areawhere we can really improve. Mayor Menino in Boston says lack of affordable housingfor young people is one of the biggestproblems the city faces."}, {"zh-tw": "都市計畫的人回應說，好啊，我們來蓋一些小小的公寓買房的人則說，我們真的不想住在小小的普通公寓裡", "en": "Developers say, OK,we'll build little teeny apartments. People say, we don't really want to livein a little teeny conventional apartment."}, {"zh-tw": "所以我們主張，讓我們蓋一些標準化的屋殼就像剛剛那部車，然後我們把最先進科技打造的內裝放入公寓中讓大家在這個開放式建築的殼裡想想什麼是他們所需的物品價值觀及活動，然後一套電腦演算法會配合打造出一組獨有的裝配線將各式內裝元件、家俱、及櫥櫃套入這個殼內形成爲個人打造的專屬空間，他們還有工具可以繼續不斷修正這就好比你與建築師合作在一開始談計劃的時候就給個替代方案讓顧客想想", "en": "So we're saying, let's builda standardized chassis, much like our car. Let's bring advanced technologyinto the apartment, technology-enabled infill, give people the toolswithin this open-loft chassis to go through a process of defining what their needsand values and activities are, and then a matching algorithmwill match a unique assembly of integrated infill components, furniture, and cabinetry,that are personalized to that individual, and they give them the tools to go through the processand to refine it, and it's something like workingwith an architect, where the dialogue starts when you give an alternativeto a person to react to."}, {"zh-tw": "對我們而言，實行這套方法最有趣的就是當你可以擁有「機器人牆」的時候。所以假設你開了一間虛擬公司，這些「機器人牆」會把你的空間從運動房轉變成辦公室你會有客人來訪，所以就設定好你要兩間客房", "en": "Now, the most interestingimplementation of that for us is when you can beginto have robotic walls, so your space can convertfrom exercise to a workplace, if you run a virtual company. You have guests over, you have two guest roomsthat are developed."}, {"zh-tw": "但你也需要一間傳統的一房公寓。或許大部分時間都維持這樣。", "en": "You have a conventionalone-bedroom arrangement when you need it. Maybe that's most of the time."}, {"zh-tw": "你邀請朋友來吃晚餐時，餐桌就打開讓16人都坐的下說不定你想要一間舞蹈室", "en": "You have a dinner party. The table folds out to fit 16 peoplein otherwise a conventional one-bedroom, or maybe you want a dance studio."}, {"zh-tw": "我的意思是建築師在想這些點子已經想了很久。我們現在要做的就是發展可以擴展到讓想要住在都市裡的這三億中國人能住的很舒服的東西", "en": "I mean, architects have been thinkingabout these ideas for a long time. What we need to do now, develop things that can scaleto those 300 million Chinese people that would like to live in the city,and very comfortably."}, {"zh-tw": "我們認為我們可以使用這些策略讓一間非常小的公寓裡面的功能如同二倍大的公寓般。我不相信所謂智慧型住家這是沒有意義的虛假概念", "en": "We think we can makea very small apartment that functions as if it's twice as bigby utilizing these strategies. I don't believe in smart homes.That's sort of a bogus concept."}, {"zh-tw": "我認為你必須建造非常陽春的屋子然後把智慧型的物品放在裡面。所以我們已經開始發展這種牆的殼", "en": "I think you have to build dumb homesand put smart stuff in it. And so we've been workingon a chassis of the wall itself."}, {"zh-tw": "你知道，標準化的平台，配備各式馬達裝上電池以利運轉，小的電磁閥可以鎖定到位，產生低電壓電源等等我們認為這些都可以標準化，所以大家能針對不同需求將物品個人化，嵌在那面牆上就像那部車，我們可以把各樣的感應器整合起來能注意到人類活動，所以如果有個嬰兒或一隻小狗在路中間擋路，你也不會撞上他。", "en": "You know, standardized platform with the motors and the batterywhen it operates, little solenoids that will lock itin place and get low-voltage power. We think this can all be standardized, and then people can personalize the stuffthat goes into that wall, and like the car, we can integrateall kinds of sensing to be aware of human activity, so if there's a babyor a puppy in the way, you won't have a problem."}, {"zh-tw": "所以都市計畫的人說，嗯，這很棒，很好所以如果我們有一棟普通的建築容積就這麼大，大概可以放14間公寓", "en": "So the developers say,well, this is great. OK, so if we have a conventional building,we have a fixed envelope, maybe we can put in 14 units."}, {"zh-tw": "如果他們真的能發揮兩倍大的功能我們可以放28間公寓這意味著你也需要兩倍停車位", "en": "If they functionas if they're twice as big, we can get 28 units in. That means twice as much parking, though."}, {"zh-tw": "蓋停車場真的很貴，在大樓裡蓋一座普通的停車場，一個車格大約要美金七萬元", "en": "Parking's really expensive. It's about 70,000 dollars per space to build a conventional parking spotinside a building."}, {"zh-tw": "所以如果你可以使用摺疊及自動化的觀念你可以僅使用七分之一的車格來停車這樣讓每部車所需的費用下降到美金一萬元這還只是停車場的費用", "en": "So if you can have folding and autonomy, you can do thatin one-seventh of the space. That goes down to 10,000 dollars per car, just for the cost of the parking."}, {"zh-tw": "再加上共享觀念你的費用可以省更多我們也可以把所有先進科技透過這一過程整合起來。這對要將技術帶進家裡的", "en": "You add shared use,and you can even go further. We can also integrateall kinds of advanced technology through this process."}, {"zh-tw": "新創企業而言是條賺錢的康莊大道這個部分，我們正與西門子合作一個計畫", "en": "There's a path to marketfor innovative companies to bring technology into the home. In this case, a projectwe're doing with Siemens."}, {"zh-tw": "我們在所有的家俱及內裝上都裝上感應器以偵測人在哪裡活動，以及他們在做什麼藍光非常有效率，所以我們裝上這些可調光量的24-比特 全彩LED照明設備", "en": "We have sensors on allthe furniture, all the infill, that understands where people areand what they're doing. Blue light is very efficient, so we have these tunable24-bit LED lighting fixtures."}, {"zh-tw": "它可以感應到人在哪裡，以及他在那裡做什麼必要時把燈光全打亮，成為全光譜白光如此我們認為會比最先進的傳統照明設備節省大約百分之30到40的能源消耗這裡只展示了來自家俱上的感應器的數據", "en": "It recognizes where the person is,what they're doing, fills out the light when necessaryto full spectrum white light, and saves maybe 30, 40 percentin energy consumption, we think, over even conventionalstate-of-the-art lighting systems.

We think these little wireless sensorsare more effective."}, {"zh-tw": "我們甚至認為我們可以把陽光個人化這在某種程度可稱是最佳個人化的範例", "en": "We think we can also personalize sunlight. That's sort of the ultimatepersonalization in some ways."}, {"zh-tw": "所以我們看上了在建築物立面裝可伸縮鏡子的方法如此可以投射陽光在房內任何一個地方所以像今天這樣的大熱天，你可以把大多數的窗戶遮起來在這裡她利用電話，告訴電腦她將在在廚房中島上準備食物，同時投射陽光在一個設定的", "en": "So we've looked at articulatingmirrors of the facade that can throw shafts of sunlightanywhere into the space, therefore allowing youto shade most of the glass on a hot day like today. In this case, she picks up her phone, she can map food preparationat the kitchen island to a particular location of sunlight."}, {"zh-tw": "位置。只要她繼續從事這個活動電腦運算就會讓光束繼續停留在那個位置這也可以與LED照明結合", "en": "An algorithm will keep it in that locationas long as she's engaged in that activity. This can be combinedwith LED lighting as well."}, {"zh-tw": "我們認為工作場所應該是共享公用的我真的認為這是未來的工作場所", "en": "We think workplaces should be shared. I mean, this is reallythe workplace of the future, I think."}, {"zh-tw": "這其實是星巴客，你知道的可能三分之一的人吧 — 你看每一個人都背靠著牆走過去就有食物和咖啡他們都沉浸在自己的小小空間裡", "en": "This is Starbucks, you know.
