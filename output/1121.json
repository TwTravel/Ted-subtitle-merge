This is Alex, the best computer voice I've been able to find, which comes as standard equipment on every Macintosh. For most of my life, I never gave a second thought to my ability to speak."}, {"zh-tw": "說話就像呼吸一樣自然。那些日子裡，我無憂無慮。", "en": "It was like breathing. In those days, I was living in a fool's paradise."}, {"zh-tw": "抗癌治療後，我失去了講話、咀嚼和喝水的能力。我被迫進入了電腦發音的虛擬世界。幾天來﹐ 在TED，我們聆聽那些精彩的、抑揚頓挫的演講。", "en": "After surgeries for cancer took away my ability to speak, eat or drink, I was forced to enter this virtual world in which a computer does some of my living for me. For several days now, we have enjoyed brilliant and articulate speakers here at TED."}, {"zh-tw": "曾經，我也可以那樣演講。就算我沒那麼聰敏，但也算侃侃而談。", "en": "I used to be able to talk like that. Maybe I wasn't as smart, but I was at least as talkative."}, {"zh-tw": "我多麼想用自己的聲音來做今天的演講，然而，講與不能講，是兩種極不同的身份，當你不能發出聲音，你被強迫變成另一個人。而我覺得聆聽電腦發音，不論長短，都很單調。", "en": "I want to devote my talk today to the act of speaking itself, and how the act of speaking or not speaking is tied so indelibly to one's identity as to force the birth of a new person when it is taken away. However, I've found that listening to a computer voice for any great length of time can be monotonous."}, {"zh-tw": "所以我邀請一些我在TED的朋友，來口述我所想說的話。先由我太太Chaz開始。", "en": "So I've decided to recruit some of my TED friends to read my words aloud for me. I will start with my wife, Chaz."}, {"zh-tw": "Chaz Ebert：“在我三次重建下巴，和重建談話能力的期間，都是 Chaz 陪在我身旁。我的第一次手術，是唾液腺癌復發時，當時是2006，當時電視台在等我出院回去主持我的影評節目‘艾伯特和羅特論電影’為了應付我為期六週的手術，和之後的恢復期，已經預先錄了六週的節目。", "en": "Chaz Ebert: It was Chaz who stood by my side through three attempts to reconstruct my jaw and restore my ability to speak. Going into the first surgery for a recurrence of salivary cancer in 2006, I expected to be out of the hospital in time to return to my movie review show, 'Ebert and Roeper at the Movies.' I had pre-taped enough shows to get me through six weeks of surgery and recuperation."}, {"zh-tw": "醫生從我腿上取走了一塊腓骨，從我肩膀裡取走了一些組織，來重建我的下巴。我的舌頭，喉嚨和聲帶，不受影響，仍然健康。（觀眾笑）（觀眾笑）", "en": "The doctors took a fibula bone from my leg and some tissue from my shoulder to fashion into a new jaw. My tongue, larynx and vocal cords were still healthy and unaffected."}, {"zh-tw": "當時我很樂觀，覺得一切都好。第一次手術很成功。", "en": "CE: I was optimistic, and all was right with the world. The first surgery was a great success."}, {"zh-tw": "我看看鏡子裡的自己，看上去還不錯。兩周後，我準備回家時，", "en": "I saw myself in the mirror and I looked pretty good. Two weeks later, I was ready to return home."}, {"zh-tw": "我用我的iPod，播放了Leonard Cohen的一首歌，叫“我是你的男人”，放給我的醫生和護士聽。突然我開始大出血", "en": "I was using my iPod to play the Leonard Cohen song 'I'm Your Man' for my doctors and nurses. Suddenly, I had an episode of catastrophic bleeding."}, {"zh-tw": "我的頸動脈爆裂了。謝天謝地，當時我還在醫院房間，我的醫生都還在，", "en": "My carotid artery had ruptured. Thank God I was still in my hospital room and my doctors were right there."}, {"zh-tw": "太太Chaz告訴我，要不是那首歌播的時間夠久，我可能已經在回家的車上，當場就把命丟了。唉，謝謝 Leonard Cohen，謝謝你救了我的命啊。（觀眾鼓掌）", "en": "Chaz told me that if that song hadn't played for so long, I might have already been in the car, on the way home, and would have died right there and then. So thank you, Leonard Cohen, for saving my life."}, {"zh-tw": "再來是第二次手術，持續了五六天但後來還是失敗了。第三次手術，嘗試將我下巴修復，但仍以失敗告終。", "en": "There was a second surgery -- which held up for five or six days and then it also fell apart. And then a third attempt, which also patched me back together pretty well, until it failed."}, {"zh-tw": "一個來自巴西的醫生說他從沒見過我這種頸動脈爆裂還活下來的人。我在醫院整整待了一年才出院總共經歷過7次頸動脈爆裂。", "en": "A doctor from Brazil said he had never seen anyone survive a carotid artery rupture. And before I left the hospital, after a year of being hospitalized, I had seven ruptures of my carotid artery."}, {"zh-tw": "再也沒有任何人告訴我我能重新講話；因為大家都看得出是怎麼回事。人類的聲音是由精密控制口腔和呼吸系統裡的呼吸而發出的。", "en": "There was no particular day when anyone told me I would never speak again; it just sort of became obvious. Human speech is an ingenious manipulation of our breath within the sound chamber of our mouth and respiratory system."}, {"zh-tw": "講話時，我們需要控制呼吸從而發聲。因而，發聲系統必須緊密才能控制空氣。", "en": "We need to be able to hold and manipulate that breath in order to form sounds. Therefore, the system must be essentially airtight in order to capture air."}, {"zh-tw": "而我失去了下顎，我的口腔漏氣，因此我的舌頭以及其他的發聲器官都無力回天。Dean Ornish: \"有挺長的一段時間，我只能在本子上寫話。", "en": "Because I had lost my jaw, I could no longer form a seal, and therefore my tongue and all of my other vocal equipment was rendered powerless. Dean Ornish: At first for a long time, I wrote messages in notebooks."}, {"zh-tw": "後來我試著在手提電腦上打字讓電腦裡的發音軟體來念。這快多了，別人也不用再嘗試閱讀我的筆跡了。", "en": "Then I tried typing words on my laptop and using its built in voice. This was faster, and nobody had to try to read my handwriting."}, {"zh-tw": "我試遍了所有網上的電腦發音軟體，有段時間用的是英式發音的，Chaz尊稱它Lawrence先生。（觀眾笑）那是當時最清楚的一款發音了。隨後，蘋果發佈了Alex版發音軟體，是我認為效果最好的一款", "en": "I tried out various computer voices that were available online, and for several months I had a British accent, which Chaz called Sir Lawrence.\" \"It was the clearest I could find. Then Apple released the Alex voice, which was the best I'd heard."}, {"zh-tw": "Alex知道驚歎號和問號的句子讀出來不一樣。看到句號時，它知道怎麼斷句讀出來的聲音就是降調的而不是繼續懸在空中。", "en": "It knew things like the difference between an exclamation point and a question mark. When it saw a period, it knew how to make a sentence sound like it was ending instead of staying up in the air."}, {"zh-tw": "有各種HTML編碼用來管理電腦發聲的時間和音調，那些我都試過。但是對我來說，他們的共同問題是太慢了。", "en": "There are all sorts of html codes you can use to control the timing and inflection of computer voices, and I've experimented with them. For me, they share a fundamental problem: they're too slow."}, {"zh-tw": "比如我在跟人交流時，我就得打字飛快反應迅速。但是別人沒時間或者耐心等著我和那些代碼玩每個字每句話都得那樣", "en": "When I find myself in a conversational situation, I need to type fast and to jump right in. People don't have the time or the patience to wait for me to fool around with the codes for every word or phrase."}, {"zh-tw": "但是我們自己的聲音價值何在呢？它對我們的形象有什麽影響？每次人們聽到電腦Alex替我說話時，他們會不會覺得很遙遠生硬？會不會因此讓我和人們產生距離或隔閡？不能講話的感受是怎樣的？我能一直感覺到，跟人群、社會脫節。一離開我的手提電腦我就不自在。", "en": "But what value do we place on the sound of our own voice? How does that affect who you are as a person? When people hear Alex speaking my words, do they experience a disconnect? Does that create a separation or a distance from one person to the next? How did I feel not being able to speak? I felt, and I still feel, a lot of distance from the human mainstream. I've become uncomfortable when I'm separated from my laptop."}, {"zh-tw": "即使那樣，我也能感覺到人們對我講話障礙沒啥耐心之後我的太太Chaz建議最好能找一家公司給我量身打造我的聲音從30年來我做的節目裡選我的聲音。", "en": "Even then, I'm aware that most people have little patience for my speaking difficulties. So Chaz suggested finding a company that could make a customized voice using my TV show voice from a period of 30 years."}, {"zh-tw": "最開始我反對。我覺得會害怕聽到自己的聲音從電腦裡出來。", "en": "At first I was against it. I thought it would be creepy to hear my own voice coming from a computer."}, {"zh-tw": "我還是習慣電腦發出的聲音不是我自己的。但最後我還是決定試試。", "en": "There was something comforting about a voice that was not my own. But I decided then to just give it a try."}, {"zh-tw": "於是我們聯絡了一家在蘇格蘭的公司他們的專業是個人化電腦發音。他們從來沒有從錄製資料裡提取過語音。", "en": "So we contacted a company in Scotland that created personalized computer voices. They'd never made one from previously-recorded materials."}, {"zh-tw": "他們所用的一般都是直接在他們的錄音室錄製的談話。但他們決定一試。", "en": "All of their voices had been made by a speaker recording original words in a control booth. But they were willing to give it a try."}, {"zh-tw": "於是我把以前我節目裡的的聲音發給他們，包括一些電影DVD裏面的一些我的評論。確實聽著像我自己的聲音。", "en": "So I sent them many hours of recordings of my voice, including several audio commentary tracks that I'd made for movies on DVDs. And it sounded like me, it really did."}, {"zh-tw": "因為那就是我啊。那是製作也沒那麼簡單。", "en": "There was a reason for that; it was me. But it wasn't that simple."}, {"zh-tw": "那些來自我電視節目的資料並不好用因為裏面夾雜太多別的聲音--比如電影背景音或者Gene Siskel和我爭吵的聲音。（觀眾笑）因為有時我說一些字句時特別用力不太適合重新組合成新句子。我讓大家先聽聽當時製作的聲音。", "en": "The tapes from my TV show weren't very useful because there were too many other kinds of audio involved -- movie soundtracks, for example, or Gene Siskel arguing with me -- and my words often had a particular emphasis that didn't fit into a sentence well enough. I'll let you hear a sample of that voice."}, {"zh-tw": "來自我和太太有次參加Oprah Winfrey的節目。下面這段聲音我叫他 羅傑初級版，", "en": "These are a few of the comments I recorded for use when Chaz and I appeared on the Oprah Winfrey program. And here's the voice we call Roger Jr."}, {"zh-tw": "或者羅傑2.0版。羅傑2.0版：Oprah，我無法形容回到你節目有多麼棒。", "en": "or Roger 2.0. Roger 2.0: Oprah, I can't tell you how great it is to be back on your show."}, {"zh-tw": "我們以前聊過很多，現在又開聊啦。這是我電腦發音的初級版。", "en": "We have been talking for a long time, and now here we are again. This is the first version of my computer voice."}, {"zh-tw": "還需改進，但是至少聽著像我了而不是什麽HAL 9000。我第一次聽的時候，一身雞皮疙瘩。", "en": "It still needs improvement, but at least it sounds like me and not like HAL 9000. When I heard it the first time, it sent chills down my spine."}, {"zh-tw": "我打字輸入，它就按我打的開始念。我讀什麽，它就用我的聲音讀什麽。", "en": "When I type anything, this voice will speak whatever I type. When I read something, it will read in my voice."}, {"zh-tw": "我把要說的提前打出來，因為我覺得看一個人坐在那裡打字不是什麼令人興奮的畫面。這個聲音是蘇格蘭一家公司為我定制，公司叫CereProc.", "en": "I have typed these words in advance, as I didn't think it would be thrilling to sit here watching me typing. The voice was created by a company in Scotland named CereProc."}, {"zh-tw": "我感覺還不錯而且很多你們現在聽到的發音都是合成的用的是我在《卡撒布蘭卡》和《大國民》的錄音。這也是他們公司第一次為專人製作聲音。雖然電腦發音好幾個版本都很好聽，但是都是別人的聲音啊。只有這個是我自己的。", "en": "It makes me feel good that many of the words you are hearing were first spoken while I was commenting on \"Casablanca\" and \"Citizen Kane.\" This is the first voice they've created for an individual. There are several very good voices available for computers, but they all sound like somebody else, while this voice sounds like me."}, {"zh-tw": "於是我打算在電視、廣播還有網上用。大家應該知道，很多電腦都自帶發音系統。", "en": "I plan to use it on television, radio and the Internet. People who need a voice should know that most computers already come with built-in speaking systems."}, {"zh-tw": "很多盲人也用有助於他們瀏覽網頁。但我得說，一年级的时候他們抱怨我話多，我現在還是這樣。（觀眾笑）", "en": "Many blind people use them to read pages on the Web to themselves. But I've got to say, in first grade, they said I talked too much, and now I still can."}, {"zh-tw": "你聽，確實聽著像我，但是發音忽高忽低，語調不自然。", "en": "Roger Ebert: As you can hear, it sounds like me, but the words jump up and down. The flow isn't natural."}, {"zh-tw": "蘇格蘭公司的人還在改進我的聲音，我也很樂觀。但目前，蘋果的Alex發音是我聽到的最好的了。", "en": "The good people in Scotland are still improving my voice, and I'm optimistic about it. But so far, the Apple Alex voice is the best one I've heard."}, {"zh-tw": "我發表過一篇部落格給Alex語音錄製聲音的人留言給我。他說他錄製了很久，各種語調都錄以備各種情況。", "en": "I wrote a blog about it and actually got a comment from the actor who played Alex. He said he recorded many long hours in various intonations to be used in the voice."}, {"zh-tw": "需要大量發音樣本。John Hunter: \"曾經的我多麼健談，", "en": "A very large sample is needed. John Hunter: All my life I was a motormouth."}, {"zh-tw": "而我也不記得何時，我說出了最後一句話也不記得說了什麽。我感覺像Harlan Ellison故事里的主人公“我沒有嘴，卻必須喊”週三的時候，David Christian還給我們講過和浩翰的宇宙相比人類文明史多麼短暫", "en": "Now I have spoken my last words, and I don't even remember for sure what they were. I feel like the hero of that Harlan Ellison story titled \"I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream.\" On Wednesday, David Christian explained to us what a tiny instant the human race represents in the time-span of the universe."}, {"zh-tw": "在它數百萬年﹐ 數十億年的歷史中地球上沒有生命。而在地球有生命的時間裡，也沒有高等生物。", "en": "For almost all of its millions and billions of years, there was no life on Earth at all. For almost all the years of life on Earth, there was no intelligent life."}, {"zh-tw": "而當人類開始傳承知識後一代又一代，人類文明才得以發展。要是跟浩翰的宇宙比，那也不過是10分鐘之前的事。", "en": "Only after we learned to pass knowledge from one generation to the next, did civilization become possible. In cosmological terms, that was about 10 minutes ago."}, {"zh-tw": "而現在居然誕生了人類最進步和神秘的工具，就是電腦。基本上是我長大後才有。", "en": "Finally came mankind's most advanced and mysterious tool, the computer. That has mostly happened in my lifetime."}, {"zh-tw": "著名的早期電腦在我故鄉厄巴纳製造，也是HAL 9000誕生之地。週三時，聽到Salman Khan的演講，關於Khan學院網站給世界各地的學生傳授各種知識是我回憶起", "en": "Some of the famous early computers were being built in my hometown of Urbana, the birthplace of HAL 9000. When I heard the amazing talk by Salman Khan on Wednesday, about the Khan Academy website that teaches hundreds of subjects to students all over the world, I had a flashback."}, {"zh-tw": "在1960年的時候當時我是一名新聞記者，仍在上高中我去了伊利諾伊大學的電腦室進行採訪PLATO的開發者", "en": "It was about 1960. As a local newspaper reporter still in high school, I was sent over to the computer lab of the University of Illinois to interview the creators of something called PLATO."}, {"zh-tw": "PLATO是自動教學程式的編寫邏輯的縮寫是一種電腦輔助教學系統當時在ILLIAC電腦上運行。", "en": "The initials stood for Programmed Logic for Automated Teaching Operations. This was a computer-assisted instruction system, which in those days ran on a computer named ILLIAC."}, {"zh-tw": "開發者說那個系統可以協助學生學習。我懷疑50年前的那天，他們想也想不到今日Salman Khan的成就。", "en": "The programmers said it could assist students in their learning. I doubt, on that day 50 years ago, they even dreamed of what Salman Khan has accomplished."}, {"zh-tw": "但這不是重點重點是PLATO系統僅僅50年前也是很短的時間", "en": "But that's not the point. The point is PLATO was only 50 years ago, an instant in time."}, {"zh-tw": "但是PLATO就演變了好幾代所用電腦系統也更加的複雜知道5年前我從維基百科上獲知他們從當時簡單的起點，到現在已經建立自己的論壇、留言板、線上測試、郵箱和聊天室圖片文字、即時通訊，遠距影片分享多人遊戲。", "en": "It continued to evolve and operated in one form or another on more and more sophisticated computers, until only five years ago. I have learned from Wikipedia that, starting with that humble beginning, PLATO established forums, message boards, online testing, email, chat rooms, picture languages, instant messaging, remote screen sharing and multiple-player games."}, {"zh-tw": "還有第一個網頁瀏覽器的產地也是在Urbana所以我的家鄉即伊利諾伊南部居然是各種我們今天試用的網絡工具的誕生地。但我並不是代表我們商會來推銷啊。（觀眾笑）", "en": "Since the first Web browser was also developed in Urbana, it appears that my hometown in downstate Illinois was the birthplace of much of the virtual, online universe we occupy today. But I'm not here from the Chamber of Commerce."}, {"zh-tw": "我來這裡是來交流的。上述這些都是發生在我有生之年", "en": "I'm here as a man who wants to communicate.

Now we live in the age of the Internet, which seems to be creating a form of global consciousness."}, {"zh-tw": "也因為此，我可以如常與人交流。我們這個時代像時空交叉的盒子", "en": "And because of it, I can communicate as well as I ever could. We are born into a box of time and space."}, {"zh-tw": "我們用文字和交流來突破它來接觸到其他人對我來說，網路開始的時候只是一種工具現在卻成了生活的依賴以維持我的存在", "en": "We use words and communication to break out of it and to reach out to others. For me, the Internet began as a useful tool and now has become something I rely on for my actual daily existence."}, {"zh-tw": "我不能講話，我只能飛快打字。電腦發音的交流有時候比較單調，但是我使用電腦，就可以更廣泛的與人交流這在以前可沒有。", "en": "I cannot speak; I can only type so fast.
