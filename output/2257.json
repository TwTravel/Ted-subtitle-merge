One time, though, I thought climbinga tree would lead to a great hiding spot, but I fell and broke my arm. I actually started first gradewith a big cast all over my torso."}, {"zh-tw": "六個星期後拆下石膏，但那時候我還不能伸手臂，我必須去復健才能彎曲及伸展。一天要做一百次，每星期做七天。我幾乎都沒做，因為我發現那很枯燥又很痛，結果我又花了六個星期才好轉。", "en": "It was taken off six weeks later,but even then, I couldn't extend my elbow, and I had to do physical therapyto flex and extend it, 100 times per day, seven days per week. I barely did it, becauseI found it boring and painful, and as a result, it took meanother six weeks to get better."}, {"zh-tw": "多年以後，我媽媽得了五十肩，導致肩膀又痛又僵硬。這個我大半輩子都相信有超能力的人，突然間需要幫忙才能穿衣吃飯。", "en": "Many years later, my momdeveloped frozen shoulder, which leads to painand stiffness in the shoulder. The person I believed for half of my lifeto have superpowers suddenly needed helpto get dressed or to cut food."}, {"zh-tw": "她每個星期都去看物理治療師，但就像我一樣，她幾乎都沒做居家復健運動，所以她花了五個多月才覺得好一點。我媽和我兩個都需要做復健，過程是做一套重複運動，讓身體的靈活度能恢復到和意外受傷前一樣。", "en": "She went each week to physical therapy,but just like me, she barely followed the home treatment, and it took herover five months to feel better. Both my mom and Irequired physical therapy, a process of doing a suiteof repetitive exercises in order to regain the range of movementlost due to an accident or injury."}, {"zh-tw": "首先，物理治療師會在旁指導病人，但是之後病人就要在家做復健運動。但是病人發現物理治療很枯燥、讓人洩氣又難懂，而且要很久才看得到成效。", "en": "At first, a physical therapistworks with patients, but then it's up to the patientsto do their exercises at home. But patients find physical therapyboring, frustrating, confusing and lengthy before seeing results."}, {"zh-tw": "很可惜，患者不合作的機率可高達 70%。這意味著大部分的病人都不做指定的運動，因而要花更長的時間才會好轉。", "en": "Sadly, patient noncompliancecan be as high as 70 percent. This means the majority of patientsdon't do their exercises and therefore takea lot longer to get better."}, {"zh-tw": "所有的物理治療師都同意特別設計的運動能減少康復所需的時間，但是病人缺乏動機去做這些運動。所以我與三個朋友，我們都是軟體達人，我們問自己，如果病人能用玩的走上康復之路不是很有趣嗎？我們開始著手寫麥拉 (MIRA) ，一套微軟的軟體平台，利用 Kinect 體感裝置，即動態捕捉攝影機，將傳統的運動轉變成電玩。", "en": "All physical therapists agreethat special exercises reduce the time needed for recovery, but patients lackthe motivation to do them. So together with three friends,all of us software geeks, we asked ourselves, wouldn't it be interesting if patientscould play their way to recovery? We started building MIRA,A P.C. software platform that uses this Kinect device,a motion capture camera, to transform traditional exercisesinto video games."}, {"zh-tw": "我已與我的物理治療師約好要做某種治療。來看看這怎麼用。", "en": "My physical therapist has already set upa schedule for my particular therapy. Let's see how this looks."}, {"zh-tw": "第一個遊戲要我讓一隻蜜蜂上下飛以採集花粉存到蜂巢，同時還要避開其他的蟲子。我以伸展及彎曲手臂來控制這隻蜜蜂，就像我七歲時拿掉石膏後要做的一樣。", "en": "The first game asks meto fly a bee up and down to gather pollen to deposit in beehives, all while avoiding the other bugs. I control the bee by doingelbow extension and flexion, just like when I was seven years oldafter the cast was taken off."}, {"zh-tw": "在設計遊戲時，我們先與物理治療師談過，瞭解病人需要做什麼樣的動作。然後我們製作出一套遊戲給患者簡單又能激勵他們的治療目標來遵循。", "en": "When designing a game,we speak to physical therapists at first to understand what movementpatients need to do. We then make that a video game to give patients simple,motivating objectives to follow."}, {"zh-tw": "但是這套軟體非常容易客製，物理治療師也能設計他們自己的運動。我的物理治療師用這套軟體錄下她自己示範肩關節外展，這是我媽媽當年得五十肩時要做的動作之一。", "en": "But the software is very customizable, and physical therapists can alsocreate their own exercises. Using the software, my physical therapist recorded herself performinga shoulder abduction, which is one of the movementsmy mom had to do when she had frozen shoulder."}, {"zh-tw": "我可以跟著治療師在螢幕左邊的示範，同時在右邊看見自己做這項推薦動作。我覺得我更想做也更有信心，因為我與我的治療師併肩運動，一起做我的治療師認為對我最有益的動作。", "en": "I can follow my therapist's exampleon the left side of the screen, while on the right, I see myselfdoing the recommended movement. I feel more engaged and confident, as I'm exercising alongside my therapist with the exercises my therapistthinks are best for me."}, {"zh-tw": "這基本上讓物理治療師能擴大應用，設計出他們認為最佳的運動。這是為避免跌倒而設計的拍賣會遊戲，為了強化肌肉及改善平衡能力。", "en": "This basically extends the applicationfor physical therapists to create whatever exercisesthey think are best. This is an auction house gamefor preventing falls, designed to strengthen musclesand improve balance."}, {"zh-tw": "身為患者，我必須做坐下起立等動作，我起立時，我就對我想買的東西出價競標。我的祖母再過兩天就要 82 歲了，超過 80 歲的人有 50％ 的機率每年至少跌倒一次，導致骨盆骨折，或甚至更糟的情況。", "en": "As a patient, I need to dosit and stand movements, and when I stand up, I bid for the items I want to buy. In two days, my grandmotherwill be 82 years old, and there's a 50 percent chancefor people over 80 to fall at least once per year, which could lead to a broken hipor even worse."}, {"zh-tw": "肌力不足及平衡感變差是跌倒的首要原因，所以透過特定運動來徹底改變這些問題，就能幫助像我祖母一樣的老人家更安全、更獨立的生活久一點。在我的運動時間結束後，麥拉會很快地向我顯示在這段期間我的進展如何。", "en": "Poor muscle tone and impaired balanceare the number one cause of falls, so reversing these problemsthrough targeted exercise will help keep older peoplelike my grandmother safer and independent for longer. When my schedule ends,MIRA briefly shows me how I progressed throughout my session."}, {"zh-tw": "我剛剛為大家示範了三種不同的遊戲，分別針對小孩、大人及老人家。這些可用在矯形科或神經科的病人身上，但我們很快就會提供用於自閉症孩童、精神健康或言語治療的選項。", "en": "I have just shown youthree different games for kids, adults and seniors. These can be used with orthopedicor neurologic patients, but we'll soon have optionsfor children with autism, mental health or speech therapy."}, {"zh-tw": "我的物理治療師可以回去看我的病歷資料，並看看在我的練習時間內所收集到的資料。她可以看我如何移動，我得多少分，我移動關節的速度有多快…等等。", "en": "My physical therapistcan go back to my profile and see the data gatheredduring my sessions. She can see how much I moved,how many points I scored, with what speed I moved my joints, and so on."}, {"zh-tw": "我的物理治療師可以用這一切來調整我的療法。我很高興這個版本現在在歐美超過十個診所使用，而且我們現在正在研發家用版。", "en": "My physical therapist can use all of thisto adapt my treatment. I'm so pleased this version is now in use in over 10 clinicsacross Europe and the U.S., and we're working on the home version."}, {"zh-tw": "我們想讓物理治療師能開這種數位治療處方，並幫助患者在家用玩的達到康復。如果當時在我媽媽或我需要物理治療時有像這樣的工具，我們遵循醫囑的過程就會更順利，或許就能好得更快了。", "en": "We want to enable physical therapiststo prescribe this digital treatment and help patients play their wayto recovery at home. If my mom or I had a tool like thiswhen we needed physical therapy, then we would have been more successfulfollowing the treatment, and perhaps gotten better a lot sooner."}, {"zh-tw": "謝謝。湯姆瑞利：柯思明，告訴我這個硬體是什麼，他們好快就收走了。那是哪家製造的？多少錢？柯思明：那是做示範用的微軟平板電腦 Surface Pro 3，但你只需要一部電腦及美金 120 元的 Kinect 體感就夠了。", "en": "Thank you. Tom Rielly: So Cosmin, tell mewhat hardware is this that they're rapidly putting away? What is that made of,and how much does it cost? Cosmin Milhau: So it'sa Microsoft Surface Pro 3 for the demo, but you just need a computerand a Kinect, which is 120 dollars."}, {"zh-tw": "湯：Kinect 體感就是大家拿來玩 Xbox3D 遊戲的，是嗎？柯：沒錯，但是你不用 Xbox，你只需要一部攝影機。湯：是，所以這是不到美金一千元的解決方案。", "en": "TR: Right, and the Kinect is the thingthat people use for their Xboxes to do 3D games, right? CM: Exactly, but you don't need the Xbox,you only need a camera. TR: Right, so this is lessthan a $1,000 solution."}, {"zh-tw": "柯：正是，四百元，你絕對可以用它。湯：現在你在診所做臨床試驗。", "en": "CM: Definitely, 400 dollars,you can definitely use it. TR: So right now, you're doingclinical trials in clinics."}, {"zh-tw": "柯：是的。湯：之後希望能成功研發家用版，我就可以在遠端運動，門診治療師也能看到我的進展和類似的東西。柯：沒錯。", "en": "CM: Yes. TR: And then the hope is to get itso it's a home version and I can do my exercise remotely, and the therapist at the cliniccan see how I'm doing and stuff like that."}, {"zh-tw": "湯：好酷。非常感謝你。柯：謝謝。", "en": "CM: Exactly. TR: Cool. Thanks so much.CM: Thank you."}], "title": "Cosmin Mihaiu Physical Therapy Is Boring Play A Game Instead"}
