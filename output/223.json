Here we go. Barry Friedman: There are all kinds of high-tech chairs here today, but this is really, I think, when it reached its peak as far as ergonomics, comfort, design, flexibility ... DH: Now obviously, this is not something we do on our regular show; it's something we just kind of learned for this, so we're going to try. But can we have some inspirational music for the beanbag chairs? BF: Nice show, Daniel, nice show. You are the man! Nice show. Man, that was good! DH: Thank you."}, {"zh-tw": "有時候人們做這些事啊，他們都會盡量讓身體貼到地板，但是你其實只是稍微做一下而已！", "en": "BF: You know, sometimes when people do those, they go all the way down. You actually just did that."}, {"zh-tw": "就是付出這樣的努力才讓我們達到今日的地位。好了，我們來做些特別的好了！", "en": "That's the kind of extra effort that's gotten us where we are today ... DH: All right, let's show them something special."}, {"zh-tw": "只差沒有獲得MacArthur獎。沒錯，看這。你知道各式各樣的(道具)", "en": "BF: ... without a MacArthur grant. Yeah, look at this. You know, all kinds of different ..."}, {"zh-tw": "老實說TED就是說一些有關發明的事。 DH：是的。Michael Moschen前一晚秀出了一些雜耍道具他之前發明的而且現在還想研發一些更好的出來。", "en": "TED is about invention, let's be honest. Right? DH: Yeah, it is. BF: Last night, Michael Moschen showed some juggling props he has invented and working on."}, {"zh-tw": "現在，Daniel將要表演他所發明的，一種我發明的雜耍特技，不久後，我看到其他表演者做這項表演。", "en": "Right now, Dan's going to show something he actually invented. DH: A type of juggling I actually invented, right after I saw another juggler do it."}, {"zh-tw": "夠了。這只是一段完整表演中的一小段啦。(鼓掌)", "en": "BF: Shut up. DH: And this is a small excerpt from a longer piece."}, {"zh-tw": "各位，這是一個雪克杯雜耍，不是表演終結者，但它確實會冷場。噢！沒錯！噢，Daniel！(鼓掌)", "en": "Folks, this is shaker cup juggling. It's not a showstopper but it certainly slows it down. BF: Oh yeah, it does. (Drum roll) BF: Oh, Daniel."}, {"zh-tw": "再一個。很好！漂亮！做得好！(鼓掌)我要來試試我的運氣。 接下來我要直接一次耍六個杯子！", "en": "DH: One more?

Should I do it on the first try or should I miss once on purpose? BF: First try? Once on purpose? (Audience: Once on purpose!) DH: How about if I try first and then decide? BF: Good idea.

It's time for Richard's help."}, {"zh-tw": "喔，好阿，也是。你知道嗎，這麼多年下來，每一年在記者會上，跟Richard做一些危險的事情好像變成我們的傳統，而且在我們表演裡都做一些和鞭子有關的事。有趣的是，這些年來Daniel都拿著氣球配合著我。", "en": "Oh, good. All right. BF: You know, over the years, every year at the conference, it's kind of become a tradition for us to do something dangerous with Richard. And we've always done something with the bullwhips in our act. It's funny, for years I did it with Daniel holding balloons."}, {"zh-tw": "然後我們就想說：「多麼愚蠢啊。」不好意思，可以改善一下麥克風的設計嗎？我想那是下一場的主題。下一場？是的，而且其實我們在這件事上，已經找到一個可以跟Richard合作的方法了。", "en": "And then we thought, \"How stupid.\" DH: Excuse me, could we work on the design of the microphone?

God, I hate that. Put your hands out like this, please."}, {"zh-tw": "往前，靠近他一點。通常是Dan拿著氣球，但現在有他被抓來站在前面保護你。", "en": "BF: No, come stay up with him. Dan used to actually hold them but now he's got you for protection."}, {"zh-tw": "這樣感覺很棒。哇，你一直都有在健身耶。", "en": "It's kind of neat. OK. DH: Wow, you've been working out."}, {"zh-tw": "才沒有，閉嘴啦。有一些可以跟Richard相處的時間耶，還不錯啦，這樣很好。好，我們開始吧！", "en": "BF: No, shut up! Having a little bit of Richard time. That's nice, that's good. OK, here we go."}, {"zh-tw": "讓他抓著你的手腕，這樣我就可以...請抓著我的手，抓一下。", "en": "Have him hold your wrist so I can ... DH: Please hold my wrist, will you.

Like 1,020? What happened there? BF: I think we were just outside. DH: I don't get it."}, {"zh-tw": "我有一種不好的預感...不要把我抓這麼緊啦！", "en": "DH: Sorry. BF: Having some bad flashbacks. RW: Do you want me to hold you or not? DH: Don't hold me that hard."}, {"zh-tw": "來吧，我會打中。再一個、再一個。我們還有一個要做的。", "en": "BF: Here we go, I'm taking it. (Balloon pops) DH: One more, one more.

DH: Could you spread your legs a little bit? BF: Gloria, you want to do it? It's very cool."}, {"zh-tw": "再試一次吧，我不想打到太接近他那邊。你可以縮一下小腹嗎？哇！太酷了！ 其實我一直想試著那樣做。", "en": "One more try. Man, I don't want to get too close. Could you just push that? DH: Wow! Boy! BF: That's cool. I always wanted to try that."}, {"zh-tw": "從這個方向跳好了。剛剛我們拿Richard的生命開玩笑，現在很公平的，我們自己也來冒險看看！", "en": "DH: Let's jump this way, though. Now, we risked Richard's life, it's only fair we risk our own lives."}, {"zh-tw": "所以，我要用三把鋒利鐮刀做一個特技。如果這樣還不夠，我會依大家的反應做判斷。這不是...", "en": "So to do that, I will juggle these three razor-sharp sickles.

Barry ..."}, {"zh-tw": "我會先在他後面助跑，他會跳過我的肩膀。", "en": "BF: I'm going to run up behind him. DH: Leap over my shoulder."}, {"zh-tw": "對，跳過他的肩膀。然後抓住半空中的鐮刀！ 然後地上會有一攤血！", "en": "BF: Up and over his shoulders. DH: Grab the blades in mid-air, land right there in a pool of blood ..."}, {"zh-tw": "然後繼續表演。你是不是覺得不可能啊？你也覺得不可思議對吧？你是不是覺得這麼危險的事情為什麼要去做啊？我們開始吧！", "en": "Still juggling. Impossible, you say? BF: Incredible, you say? DH: Why bother, you say? BF: Here we go."}, {"zh-tw": "你們就做吧，雜耍小子！這個人，這個人發明空氣。我也這麼覺得耶。", "en": "DH: Just do it juggler boys, you say? BF: This guy, this guy invented air. DH: I think so, that's right."}, {"zh-tw": "連鉛筆也是。他發明鉛筆。", "en": "Even the pencil. BF: He invented the pencil."}, {"zh-tw": "好，我們現在要開始了，但是請記住我們花了十年的時間才把它練成。沒錯，你們等一下看到的那個特技我們花了十年才練好。", "en": "DH: All right, we'll do this trick, but please remember it took us over 10 years to perfect. BF: Ten years to perfect, which you're about to see."}, {"zh-tw": "其實這也沒有很難啦，只是我們不喜歡太常練習而已啦。麻煩的是，太常巡迴。", "en": "DH: It's not that difficult, we just don't like to practice that much. BF: No, it's a hassle. Traveling too much."}, {"zh-tw": "我們要不要給觀眾驗證，這鐮刀可能是假的啊？開玩笑的啦，它真的是一把鋒利的刀！有人要丟隻小豬或小羊上來試試看的嗎？丟到台上來！還是要犧牲一個處女？任何東西都可以喔。Gloria人呢？她去抓小動物了啦！", "en": "Actually, we will take a second to prove -- this could be fake -- that the blades are indeed razor-sharp.

BF: No, she's got ... farm animal."}, {"zh-tw": "你有隻農場小動物喔？就賭賭看啦。好啦，我們開始吧。從上面跳過去！跳過去哦！", "en": "DH: Do you have a small farm animal? Just trying to play the odds. All right, here we go.

DH: Do you feel everything's OK? The atmosphere, the ..."}, {"zh-tw": "恩，還可以。上面工作人員都準備好了嗎？嗯。", "en": "BF: Yeah, a little sketchy. DH: Everything up here's OK? BF: Yeah."}, {"zh-tw": "那我們開始嘍！這裡好像有一點點... 燈光師是哪位呀？ 可以請你...這個燈泡正對著我...你打光可以再直接打進我眼睛一點沒關係，我真的快瞎了。", "en": "DH: Then here we go. BF: This one's a little ... Who's doing the lights? Could you point that a little more directly into my eyeballs? Is that possible?  I can still see a little."}, {"zh-tw": "光熱度需要再強一點，我們還沒被煮熟。我們開玩笑開得太過分了啦。", "en": "DH: And turn up the intensity; we're still pink in the middle. We went too far."}, {"zh-tw": "真的，太誇張了。這樣講起來太寫實了啦。身體上的設計，那可是完全不同的東西。", "en": "BF: Yeah, it's too far. It's too much of a visual. The design of the body is a whole different thing."}, {"zh-tw": "DH: Barry準備好了嗎？ BF: 從上面來喔。麻煩放一下我們那個jumping的音樂，謝啦！可以再大聲一點嗎？我們的工作人員實在太優秀了！噢！噢！噢！沒關係。沒關係。", "en": "DH: Ready, Barry? BF: Over the top. DH: May we have our jumping music please? (Silence) May we have it a bit louder? BF: They're a good crew! Whoa! DH: Whoa, sorry. All right."}, {"zh-tw": "繼續。沒關係，再試一次。", "en": "BF: We're going on.

Sorry about that."}, {"zh-tw": "我以為我的部分比較困難。來吧！你準備好了就來吧！", "en": "BF: I thought I had the hard part. OK. DH: Whenever you're ready."}, {"zh-tw": "我們做到了！來吧來吧！ 大家一起跳舞慶祝一下！快快快！誰來跳一下？好了好了，夠了。大家都沒跟著跳，只有我們兩個跳好奇怪喔。", "en": "BF: There we go! All right, get up! Come on and dance! DH: Dance, come on. BF: Come on and dance! Somebody dance! Come on! Wow, wow, OK, stop. Weird, no one dances. We're two guys doing this."}, {"zh-tw": "我想大家應該覺得很尷尬吧。法籍裁判", "en": "I think that's uncomfortable for everyone. DH: The French judge ..."}, {"zh-tw": "有個更快的方式。法國裁判給5.2分。", "en": "BF: One more quick thing. DH: The French judge gives it a 5.2."}, {"zh-tw": "恩，你知道的DH：那你繼續-- BF：好的，下一個。", "en": "BF: Well, you know ... DH: There you go ... BF: Oh, yeah. Another one coming in."}, {"zh-tw": "跟觀眾說一些我們的經歷好了！好啊！ 你們有些人或許早就看過我們的經歷了，我們得過兩次世界雜耍冠軍。", "en": "DH: Tell them about our bio and stuff. BF: Yeah. In our bio, some of you may have read that we've won two world juggling championships."}, {"zh-tw": "信不信由你啦！沒有人靠耍長鞭或接雪克杯贏得雜耍冠軍。我們現在就表演一小段我們贏過其他隊伍的特技片段給大家看看！.", "en": "And believe it or not, you don't win juggling champions for doing things with bullwhips or shaker cups.

BF: Good."}, {"zh-tw": "我知道你們在想什麼：你們一定覺得其他雜耍隊伍很爛。雜耍的評價很低。", "en": "DH: I know what you're thinking: other juggling teams must really suck. BF: Juggling's got a bad rap."}, {"zh-tw": "等一下，Barry，現在還有一根棒子在我腳邊耶！你看，它還有一個雙胞胎弟弟欸！", "en": "DH: But wait, Barry, there's still one more club lying there by my foot. And look, it has a twin! BF: Shut up."}, {"zh-tw": "但還有一根棒子在我腳邊。你要我怎麼做啊？Richard你告訴他啦，這是你最後一年了！", "en": "DH: There's still one more by my foot. What do you want me to do with it? BF: Richard you tell him, it's your last year."}, {"zh-tw": "這是個相當好的安排，Richard。是啊，是個很好的安排！是個成功的安排。", "en": "DH: That's a pretty good setup, Richard. BF: Yeah, it's a good setup. That's a big setup."}, {"zh-tw": "好的，我現在要用-- 像豹一樣靈敏的反應把它撿起來！很好！", "en": "DH: You can't get any better than that. All right. What I will do: I will use my panther-like reflexes.

BF: Nice."}, {"zh-tw": "欸Barry我碰到它了！ 這樣應該夠了吧！重點是你進步了！", "en": "DH: I touched it, Barry. That should be enough. BF: It's progress, that's the thing."}, {"zh-tw": "如何？你也試一次看看。噢！在你那邊了耶，Barry！", "en": "DH: How about that? I'll do it again. Oh wait, it's on your side, Barry."}, {"zh-tw": "你那邊風很大欸。真的！太奇怪了！你沒想到它居然只影響半個舞臺吧。是真的！很奇怪耶！", "en": "And it's awfully windy over there. BF: It is, it's weird. You wouldn't think it would affect half the stage, but it is. It's weird."}, {"zh-tw": "看這個，我要將第七個棒子滑到我腳上。哇！這個技巧也太棒了吧Barry！哇，看它怎麼躺在那邊的。", "en": "Watch this: what I'm going to do is slide the seventh one onto my foot. DH: Wow! What a great trick, Barry!

You're my Jim Shea, Jr. Too much Olympics."}, {"zh-tw": "我要把第七根棒子用腳踢起來！在哪裡，Barry？在哪裡？快點告訴我們！", "en": "BF: From my foot, I'll attempt to kick the seventh club. Here we go. DH: Where, Barry? Where? Tell us, Barry."}, {"zh-tw": "好想知道你要說什麼呢！會是什麼呢？有什麼名言錦句？有什麼金玉良言？Barry你要買一個母音嗎？這是你最後的答案嗎？好，你偶爾需要把電視關掉！沒錯，沒錯。", "en": "[Unclear] eagerly awaits your next syllable. What will it be?
