Difficult question,simple answer: nothing. We cannot predict the future."}, {"zh-tw": "我們只能給未來一個願景，去想像未來的樣子富有破壞性創新的願景能激發靈感這就是打破一連串平凡無奇思維的重要原因這就是打破一連串平凡無奇思維的重要原因有許多人創造出他們自己心中未來的樣貌例如，這是廿世紀初期的願景", "en": "We only can create a visionof the future, how it might be, a vision which reveals disruptiveideas, which is inspiring, and this is the most important reason which breaks the chainsof common thinking. There are a lot of people who created their own visionabout the future, for instance, this vision herefrom the early 20th century."}, {"zh-tw": "在未來有種越洋的飛機只需要一天半就能橫越大西洋", "en": "It says here that thisis the ocean plane of the future. It takes only one and a half daysto cross the Atlantic Ocean."}, {"zh-tw": "今天我們知道這種想像並沒有成真而這是現今最大的飛機空中巴士 A380，非常龐大能夠乘載許多人而在技術上完全不同於剛剛給你們看過的想像圖", "en": "Today, we know that this futurevision didn't come true. So this is our largestairplane which we have, the Airbus A380, and it's quite huge, so a lot of people fit in there and it's technically completely different than the vision I've shown to you."}, {"zh-tw": "我在空中巴士裡的一個團隊創造一個我們的願景能永續經營的航空事業永續對我們很重要這不僅應與社會價值聯結亦應與環保和經濟價值聯結", "en": "I'm working in a team with Airbus, and we have created our vision about a more sustainablefuture of aviation. So sustainability is quiteimportant for us, which should incorporate social but as well as environmentaland economic values."}, {"zh-tw": "所以我們創造了一種顛覆性的結構這仿效了大自然中骨頭或骨骼的設計因此這個可能看起來有點奇怪尤其對於那些了解結構的人", "en": "So we have created a verydisruptive structure which mimics the designof bone, or a skeleton, which occurs in nature. So that's why it looksmaybe a little bit weird, especially to the people who dealwith structures in general."}, {"zh-tw": "但至少這像是一件藝術品是對於不同未來的一種探索未來的乘客會是什麼樣子的？有年邁的、有年輕的、我們有日益升高的女性勢力還有一個影響所有人的重大趨勢", "en": "But at least it's just a kind of artwork to explore our ideasabout a different future. What are the main customers of the future? So, we have the old, we have the young, we have the uprising power of women, and there's one mega-trendwhich affects all of us."}, {"zh-tw": "這是未來的人體體態小孩的身形愈來愈大，但同時我們也向不同的方向成長", "en": "These are the future anthropometrics. So our children are gettinglarger, but at the same time we are growing into different directions."}, {"zh-tw": "所以我們需要在非常擁擠的機艙裡有更大的空間這些人們有不同的需求", "en": "So what we need is spaceinside the aircraft, inside a very dense area. These people have different needs."}, {"zh-tw": "所以我們看到積極推廣健康的明確需求尤其是老年人我們希望有量身訂做的特別禮遇", "en": "So we see a clear needof active health promotion, especially in the case of the old people. We want to be treated as individuals."}, {"zh-tw": "我們希望整個旅程是富有成效的而我們正在做的就是在未來應用最新的人機介面而且把這些全部整合在單一產品中所以我們以科技的題材結合所有的需求", "en": "We like to be productivethroughout the entire travel chain, and what we are doing in the future is we want to use the latestman-machine interface, and we want to integrate thisand show this in one product. So we combined these needswith technology's themes."}, {"zh-tw": "例如，我們自問要如何產生更多的光？例如，我們自問要如何產生更多的光？如何在機艙內有更多的自然光？以這飛機為例，它不再有窗戶的設計在未來我們需要哪些資訊和通訊軟體呢？在未來我們需要哪些資訊和通訊軟體呢？我相信未來的飛機會有自己的意識", "en": "So for instance, we are asking ourselves, how can we create more light? How can we bring more naturallight into the airplane? So this airplane has nowindows anymore, for example. What about the dataand communication software which we need in the future? My belief is that the airplaneof the future will get its own consciousness."}, {"zh-tw": "它會更像是一個生命有機體而不是只是複雜工程的集合體這在將來是非常大的改變", "en": "It will be more like a living organism than just a collectionof very complex technology. This will be very different in the future."}, {"zh-tw": "它會直接與機上的乘客交流它會直接與機上的乘客交流再談到材枓像是合成生物學", "en": "It will communicate directly with the passenger in its environment. And then we are talkingalso about materials, synthetic biology, for example."}, {"zh-tw": "我相信接下來我們會有愈來愈多應用在結構上的新材料因為結構是飛機最關鍵的設計之一讓我們比較一下新舊兩種世界", "en": "And my belief is that we will getmore and more new materials which we canput into structure later on, because structure is one of the keyissues in aircraft design. So let's compare the oldworld with the new world."}, {"zh-tw": "讓你們看看我們的作法這是 A380 機組員休息艙的框架", "en": "I just want to show you herewhat we are doing today. So this is a bracket of an A380crew rest compartment."}, {"zh-tw": "以傳統銑床方式設計，重量很重以傳統銑床方式設計，重量很重而這裡是同樣功能的框架", "en": "It takes a lot of weight, and it follows the classical design rules. This here is an equal bracketfor the same purpose."}, {"zh-tw": "但利用骨骼的設計方式設計過程是完全的不同", "en": "It follows the design of bone. The design processis completely different."}, {"zh-tw": "一個是 1.2 公斤而另一個僅有 0.6 公斤這 3D 列印技術和新的設計方式確實幫助我們減輕了重量重量是設計飛機時最重要的議題因為這和溫室氣體排放量有直接關係", "en": "At the one hand, we have 1.2 kilos, and at the other hand 0.6 kilos. So this technology, 3Dprinting, and new design rules really help us to reduce the weight, which is the biggest issuein aircraft design, because it's directly linkedto greenhouse gas emissions."}, {"zh-tw": "將這個想法加以延伸大自然如何建造它的元件和結構呢？大自然很聰明，把所有的資訊全部放進一個小小的結構單元中，我們稱之為 DNA", "en": "Push this idea a little bit forward. So how does nature build itscomponents and structures? So nature is very clever.It puts all the information into these small buildingblocks, which we call DNA."}, {"zh-tw": "而大自然利用 DNA 建造大型的骨架所以我們在這裡看到「由單元到總體」的模式正如我說的，因為所有的訊息都在 DNA 當中", "en": "And nature builds largeskeletons out of it. So we see a bottom-up approach here, because all the information,as I said, are inside the DNA."}, {"zh-tw": "而這也結合了「由總體到單元」的模式因為我們在每天的生活中我們鍛鍊肌肉和骨骼使其愈發強壯同樣的模式可以應用在工程中", "en": "And this is combinedwith a top-down approach, because what we are doingin our daily life is we train our muscles,we train our skeleton, and it's getting stronger. And the same approach can beapplied to technology as well."}, {"zh-tw": "例如，我們以碳奈米管為結構元件用來完成建造一個無鉚釘的巨大骨架以下你可以看見這是如何辦到的", "en": "So our building block is carbonnanotubes, for example, to create a large, rivet-lessskeleton at the end of the day. How this looks in particular,you can show it here."}, {"zh-tw": "想像碳奈米管在 3D 印表機裡生成嵌在一個塑膠的模型內順著組件中的施力延伸數以兆計的碳奈米管", "en": "So imagine you havecarbon nanotubes growing inside a 3D printer, and they are embeddedinside a matrix of plastic, and follow the forceswhich occur in your component. And you've got trillions of them."}, {"zh-tw": "如森林般地聚結在一起利用這群「森林」作形態上的最佳化可以用來當作傳輸電能或資訊的結構或次結構我們拿這個材料結合「由總體到單元」的模式造出更巨大的元件", "en": "So you really align them to wood, and you take this wood and makemorphological optimization, so you make structures, sub-structures, which allows you to transmitelectrical energy or data. And now we take thismaterial, combine this with a top-down approach, and build bigger and bigger components."}, {"zh-tw": "所以，未來的飛機會是什麼樣子？我們有非常特別的座椅可以配合不同身形的乘客可以配合不同身形的乘客我們在飛機上可以有社交的空間像是騰出一個區域打虛擬高爾夫球", "en": "So how might the airplaneof the future look? So we have very differentseats which adapt to the shape of the future passenger, with the different anthropometrics. We have social areas inside the aircraft which might turn into a place where you can play virtual golf."}, {"zh-tw": "最後，這個覆蓋著一種透明生物高分子膜的仿生物結構將會徹底地改變我們看待未來飛機的方式如 Jason Silva 所言「既然我們可以想像，那何不讓它成真？」期待在未來與你相見，謝謝。", "en": "And finally, this bionic structure, which is covered by a transparent biopolymer membrane,will really change radically how we look at aircrafts in the future. So as Jason Silva said, if we can imagine it, why not make it so? See you in the future. Thank you."}], "title": "Bastian Schaefer A 3D Printed Jumbo Jet"}
