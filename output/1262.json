While scientists regularly publish their latest research, we magicians do not like to share our methods and secrets. That's true even amongst peers."}, {"zh-tw": "但如果你把創意實踐看作是一種研究,或者是一種人類的研究與發展的藝術,那像我這種電子幻術師如何才能分享自己的研究呢?我的特長是將電子技術和魔術結合.大約三年前,我開始了一項練習以開放和包容的方式與開放源的軟件社區一起創造新一代的魔術電子道具魔術師最終可以共享這些道具讓自己在過程中走的更遠更快的找到靈感.", "en": "But if you look at creative practice as a form of research, or art as a form of R&D for humanity, then how could a cyber illusionist like myself share his research? Now my own speciality is combining digital technology and magic. And about three years ago, I started an exercise in openness and inclusiveness by reaching out into the open-source software community to create new digital tools for magic -- tools that could eventually be shared with other artists to start them off further on in the process and to get them to the poetry faster."}, {"zh-tw": "今天在這裡, 我要向大家展示一些通過合作研究出的成果.它是一種可以擴增實境追蹤投影, 以及映射的系統,或者稱之為數字化的說故事道具.", "en": "Today, I'd like to show you something which came out of these collaborations. It's an augmented reality projection tracking and mapping system, or a digital storytelling tool."}, {"zh-tw": "麻煩把燈關掉.試一試", "en": "Could we bring down the lights please? Thank you. So let's give this a try."}, {"zh-tw": "我會用這塊板子來向大家展示我生命的鏡頭.掌聲音樂實在很抱歉. 我忘了畫地板.", "en": "And I'm going to use it to give you my take on the stuff of life. (Music) Terribly sorry.
