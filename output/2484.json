Sounds impossible, doesn't it? It's not. And the answer relies on a formulathat all paleontologists use."}, {"zh-tw": "而且我將告訴你這個秘密。首先，尋找相應年代的岩石。", "en": "And I'm going to tell you the secret. First, find rocks of the right age."}, {"zh-tw": "然後，這些岩石必須是沉積岩。再者，岩石的積層必須是自然暴露的。", "en": "Second, those rocksmust be sedimentary rocks. And third, layers of those rocksmust be naturally exposed."}, {"zh-tw": "這樣就足夠了。滿足這三件條件後你就可以動手了，你找到化石的機會很大。", "en": "That's it. Find those three thingsand get yourself on the ground, chances are goodthat you will find fossils."}, {"zh-tw": "現在我來解析這個公式。生物只存在於某個特定的地質斷層。", "en": "Now let me break down this formula. Organisms exist only during certaingeological intervals."}, {"zh-tw": "所以你必須尋找相應年代的岩石，依照你的興趣。如果你想找三葉蟲，那你必須找那些相當古老的古生代岩石 --年齡在5億和2.5億之間的岩石。", "en": "So you have to findrocks of the right age, depending on what your interests are. If you want to find trilobites, you have to find the really,really old rocks of the Paleozoic -- rocks between a half a billionand a quarter-billion years old."}, {"zh-tw": "如果你想要尋找恐龍，就不要在古生代岩石裡找，你不會找到的。它們還未演化。", "en": "Now, if you want to find dinosaurs, don't look in the Paleozoic,you won't find them. They hadn't evolved yet."}, {"zh-tw": "你要找相對年輕的中生代岩石，並且是恐龍存活的年代，大概是2.35億至6600萬年前。目前，要尋找適當年代的岩石還算容易，大致來說，地球是根據地質來繪制的。", "en": "You have to find the youngerrocks of the Mesozoic, and in the case of dinosaurs, between 235 and 66 million years ago. Now, it's fairly easy to find rocksof the right age at this point, because the Earth is, to a coarse degree, geologically mapped."}, {"zh-tw": "這是一個得來不易的資訊。地球的編年史刻寫在岩石裡，一章接著一章，所以最古老的一頁在底層，而最新的在上面。", "en": "This is hard-won information. The annals of Earth historyare written in rocks, one chapter upon the next, such that the oldest pages are on bottom and the youngest on top."}, {"zh-tw": "好了，如果真那麽容易，地質學家會欣喜若狂。可惜不是。", "en": "Now, were it quite that easy,geologists would rejoice. It's not."}, {"zh-tw": "地球圖書館很老舊。裡面並沒有管理員維持秩序。", "en": "The library of Earth is an old one. It has no librarian to impose order."}, {"zh-tw": "經歷長期運作，任何地質變動過程對於各時代的地層造成各種可能的影響。大部分內容剛寫完後就被破壞了。", "en": "Operating over vast swaths of time, myriad geological processesoffer every possible insult to the rocks of ages. Most pages are destroyedsoon after being written."}, {"zh-tw": "有一些被新的覆蓋，使它難以還原消失已久的地質原貌。在如流沙飛逝的時間中倖免的部分，也絕非真正安全。", "en": "Some pages are overwritten, creating difficult-to-decipher palimpsestsof long-gone landscapes. Pages that do find sanctuaryunder the advancing sands of time are never truly safe."}, {"zh-tw": "不像月球 -- 我們死寂的衛星 --地球是活的，充滿著生命力和破壞力，為地質的新陳代謝提供動力。阿波羅太空人帶回來的月球岩石，所有數據顯示其有太陽系的年齡。", "en": "Unlike the Moon --our dead, rocky companion -- the Earth is alive, pulsingwith creative and destructive forces that power its geological metabolism. Lunar rocks brought backby the Apollo astronauts all date back to about the ageof the Solar System."}, {"zh-tw": "月球岩石是永久的。另一方面，地球岩石面臨著活著的岩石圈的危機。", "en": "Moon rocks are forever. Earth rocks, on the other hand,face the perils of a living lithosphere."}, {"zh-tw": "它們都會遭受毀滅，通過一些合併、毀傷、壓縮、折疊、撕裂、燒灼和烘烤。所以，地球的史書是不完整的和散亂的。", "en": "All will suffer ruination, through some combinationof mutilation, compression, folding, tearing, scorching and baking. Thus, the volumes of Earth historyare incomplete and disheveled."}, {"zh-tw": "這個圖書館是廣闊而壯麗的 --卻也是衰老的。同時岩石擁有它破碎的複雜的記錄，隱藏了它的涵義直到近代。", "en": "The library is vast and magnificent -- but decrepit. And it was this tattered complexityin the rock record that obscured its meaninguntil relatively recently."}, {"zh-tw": "大自然沒有提供卡片式目錄給地質學家 --這需要我們去編寫。在蘇美爾人學會將他們的想法記錄在泥板上的五千年後，地球這本冊子對人類來說仍然是高深莫測的。", "en": "Nature provided no card catalogfor geologists -- this would have to be invented. Five thousand years after the Sumerianslearned to record their thoughts on clay tablets, the Earth's volumes remainedinscrutable to humans."}, {"zh-tw": "我們對地質學知之甚少，對我們星球的歷史也了解不多並忽略了我們與古老時期的聯繫。直到19世紀之後，我們眼罩的才被拿掉，首先，詹姆斯·赫頓的《地球學說》問世，書中提到地球的起源無跡可尋，終結也無法預測，而後，威廉·史密斯編繪出英國地圖，這首張國家疆域的地質圖，讓我們第一次對特定年代岩石的分佈進行預測。", "en": "We were geologically illiterate, unaware of the antiquityof our own planet and ignorant of our connection to deep time. It wasn't until the turnof the 19th century that our blinders were removed, first, with the publicationof James Hutton's \"Theory of the Earth,\" in which he told us that the Earthreveals no vestige of a beginning and no prospect of an end; and then, with the printingof William Smith's map of Britain, the first country-scale geological map, giving us for the first time predictive insight into wherecertain types of rocks might occur."}, {"zh-tw": "因此，你可以說：「如果去那裡，我們會進入侏羅紀。」「翻過這座山丘，我們應該會找到白堊紀。」那如果你想尋找三葉蟲，那就準備一張好的地圖然後找尋古生代的岩石。如果你想像我一樣去想找尋恐龍，那就要找到中生代的岩石。", "en": "After that, you could say things like, \"If we go over there,we should be in the Jurassic,\" or, \"If we go up over that hill,we should find the Cretaceous.\" So now, if you want to find trilobites, get yourself a good geological map and go to the rocks of the Paleozoic. If you want to find dinosaurs like I do, find the rocks of Mesozoic and go there."}, {"zh-tw": "當然，化石只會出現在沉積岩中，這種岩石由沙和泥土組成。化石不會出現在像花崗岩這類由岩漿組成的火成岩中，或是經高溫擠壓而形成的變質岩中。", "en": "Now of course, you can only makea fossil in a sedimentary rock, a rock made by sand and mud. You can't have a fossil in an igneous rock formedby magma, like a granite, or in a metamorphic rockthat's been heated and squeezed."}, {"zh-tw": "而且你要去沙漠。並不是恐龍只生活在沙漠裡；它們可生活在任何陸地上和任何可想像到的環境中。", "en": "And you have to get yourself in a desert. It's not that dinosaursparticularly lived in deserts; they lived on every land mass and in every imaginable environment."}, {"zh-tw": "你需要去沙漠，這樣岩石就不會被植被覆蓋，而且在那裡，侵蝕會讓新的岩層暴露。所以，具備這三個條件：特定年代的岩石，沙漠裡的沉積岩，然後你站在沙漠上，一直走，直到看見有骨骼化石突出岩層。", "en": "It's that you need to go to a placethat's a desert today, a place that doesn't havetoo many plants covering up the rocks, and a place where erosion is alwaysexposing new bones at the surface. So find those three things: rocks of the right age, that are sedimentary rocks, in a desert, and get yourself on the ground, and you literally walk until you see a bonesticking out of the rock."}, {"zh-tw": "這是張南巴塔哥尼亞的照片。地上的每個石子都是一塊恐龍骨骼化石。", "en": "Here's a picture that I tookin Southern Patagonia. Every pebble that you seeon the ground there is a piece of dinosaur bone."}, {"zh-tw": "所以在那個情況下，問題不是能否找到化石，你一定會找到的。問題是，找到的是否對科學研究有意義？所以，為了解決此問題，我會在方法中增加第四步，那就是：離其他的古生物學家越遠越好。", "en": "So when you're in that right situation, it's not a question of whetheryou'll find fossils or not; you're going to find fossils. The question is: Will you find somethingthat is scientifically significant? And to help with that, I'm going to adda fourth part to our formula, which is this: get as far away from otherpaleontologists as possible."}, {"zh-tw": "並不是我不喜歡他們。而是當你去到一個相對未探索的地方時，不僅有更大機會找到化石，而且還可能在科學上有所新發現。", "en": "It's not that I don't likeother paleontologists. When you go to a placethat's relatively unexplored, you have a much better chanceof not only finding fossils but of finding somethingthat's new to science."}, {"zh-tw": "這就是我尋找恐龍的秘方，而且我曾在世界各地用過。在2004年南半球的夏季，我前往南美洲的最南端，阿根廷的巴塔哥尼亞的南部，去尋找恐龍：那個有特定年代的陸生沉積岩的地方，位於沙漠中，而且是古生物學家甚少探訪之地。", "en": "So that's my formulafor finding dinosaurs, and I've applied it all around the world. In the austral summer of 2004, I went to the bottom of South America, to the bottom of Patagonia, Argentina, to prospect for dinosaurs: a place that had terrestrialsedimentary rocks of the right age, in a desert, a place that had been barely visitedby paleontologists."}, {"zh-tw": "我們找到這個。一條股骨，一條大腿骨，是屬於一隻巨型草食恐龍。", "en": "And we found this. This is a femur, a thigh bone, of a giant, plant-eating dinosaur."}, {"zh-tw": "那骨頭有2.2米長。差不多超過7英尺。", "en": "That bone is 2.2 meters across. That's over seven feet long."}, {"zh-tw": "但不幸的是，那條股骨是孤立的。我們不斷的挖，可都沒有其他發現。", "en": "Now, unfortunately,that bone was isolated. We dug and dug and dug,and there wasn't another bone around."}, {"zh-tw": "但它卻吸引著我們次年返回繼續探尋。而在新探索開展的當天，我找到這個：另一條兩米長的股骨，這次它並不是獨立的，它與其他145塊巨型草食恐龍骨頭連在一起。", "en": "But it made us hungry to go backthe next year for more. And on the first dayof that next field season, I found this: another two-meter femur, only this time not isolated, this time associated with 145 other bones of a giant plant eater."}, {"zh-tw": "而在三段艱難的挖掘季之後，現場變成這樣。你可以看見那隻巨獸的尾巴卷曲著在我身邊。", "en": "And after three more hard,really brutal field seasons, the quarry came to look like this. And there you see the tailof that great beast wrapping around me."}, {"zh-tw": "躺在這裡的巨獸是恐龍新品種，最後它被命名為「許蘭氏無畏龍」。無畏龍從鼻到尾長85尺。它站立時肩部達兩層半樓高，活著時體重有65噸。", "en": "The giant that lay in this grave,the new species of dinosaur, we would eventually call\"Dreadnoughtus schrani.\" Dreadnoughtus was 85 feetfrom snout to tail. It stood two-and-a-half storiesat the shoulder, and all fleshed out in life,it weighed 65 tons."}, {"zh-tw": "人們有時會問，「無畏龍是否比暴龍大？」事實它有八到九個暴龍那麼大。有一個作為古生物學家很酷的事是你可以命名你發現的新品種。", "en": "People ask me sometimes,\"Was Dreadnoughtus bigger than a T. rex?\" That's the mass of eight or nine T. rex. Now, one of the really cool thingsabout being a paleontologist is when you find a new species,you get to name it."}, {"zh-tw": "而我一直很介意大型草食恐龍常被描述成大是自然景觀中被動、笨重的盤中肉。它們絕非那樣。", "en": "And I've always thought it a shamethat these giant, plant-eating dinosaurs are too often portrayed as passive,lumbering platters of meat on the landscape. They're not."}, {"zh-tw": "大型草食動物也可能脾氣暴躁，也可以稱霸一方 --你不會想與河馬，犀牛或水牛亂來。黃石國家公園裡的野牛遠比灰熊傷了更多人。", "en": "Big herbivores can be surly,and they can be territorial -- you do not want to mess with a hippoor a rhino or a water buffalo. The bison in Yellowstone injurefar more people than do the grizzly bears."}, {"zh-tw": "所以你可以想像一隻重65噸如大公牛般的無畏龍在繁殖季節堅守領地的情景嗎？它會變得極度危險，它毫無畏懼並對周圍造成威脅。所以獲名「無畏龍」，「無所畏懼」。然而，要擁有如此大的體形，像無畏龍這樣的動物必須很高效。", "en": "So can you imagine a big bull,65-ton Dreadnoughtus in the breeding season, defending a territory? That animal would have beenincredibly dangerous, a menace to all around, and itselfwould have had nothing to fear. And thus the name, \"Dreadnoughtus,\" or, \"fears nothing.\" Now, to grow so large, an animal like Dreadnoughtuswould've had to have been a model of efficiency."}, {"zh-tw": "它長長的脖子和尾巴可幫助散熱，起到控溫作用。而其長脖也是個高效的進食機制。", "en": "That long neck and long tail help itradiate heat into the environment, passively controlling its temperature. And that long neck also servesas a super-efficient feeding mechanism."}, {"zh-tw": "無畏龍站在原地，移動脖子就能清乾淨大片的植被，攝取大量的熱量，同時卻消耗無幾。這些動物演化成鬥牛犬般的寬步姿態，讓它們穩定性更好，因為當你有65噸重，如房子一樣大時，跌倒的懲罰是死亡。", "en": "Dreadnoughtus could standin one place and with that neck clear out a huge envelope of vegetation, taking in tens of thousands of calorieswhile expending very few. And these animals evolveda bulldog-like wide-gait stance, giving them immense stability, because when you're 65 tons,when you're literally as big as a house, the penalty for falling over is death."}, {"zh-tw": "是的，這些動物又大又堅硬，但它們受不了那樣的一擊。無畏龍倒下後，肋骨破裂，同時刺穿肺部，", "en": "Yeah, these animals are big and tough, but they won't take a blow like that. Dreadnoughtus falls over,ribs break and pierce lungs."}, {"zh-tw": "內臟爆裂。如果你是一隻65噸重的無畏龍，你不會想跌倒 -- 一次也不想。", "en": "Organs burst. If you're a big 65-ton Dreadnoughtus, you don't get to fall downin life -- even once."}, {"zh-tw": "好了，在這隻無畏龍的軀體被掩埋，肉被細菌，蠕蟲和昆蟲饞食分解後，骨頭轉變型態，與地下水進行分子交換，變得越來越像周圍的岩石。當一層層的泥沙累積起來，四周的壓力就像石手套向中心施壓，牢固持久的握住每一塊骨頭，緊緊的包裹住。", "en": "Now, after this particularDreadnoughtus carcass was buried and de-fleshed by a multitudeof bacteria, worms and insects, its bones underwent a brief metamorphosis, exchanging molecules with the groundwater and becoming more and morelike the entombing rock. As layer upon layerof sediment accumulated, pressure from all sidesweighed in like a stony glove whose firm and enduring grip heldeach bone in a stabilizing embrace."}, {"zh-tw": "然後就是漫長的......什麼都沒發生。", "en": "And then came the long ... nothing."}, {"zh-tw": "一代又一代，一直一樣，數不清的沒事發生。同時， 骸骨保持永恆不變，完美的平衡狀態，在它的石棺中。", "en": "Epoch after epoch of sameness, nonevents without number. All the while, the skeleton layeverlasting and unchanging in perfect equilibrium within its rocky grave."}, {"zh-tw": "同時，地球的歷史展開了。恐龍又统治1200萬年，它們的霸權才在一場曠世浩劫中終結。", "en": "Meanwhile, Earth history unfolded above. The dinosaurs would reignfor another 12 million years before their hegemony was snuffed outin a fiery apocalypse."}, {"zh-tw": "而後大陸漂移。哺乳類動物崛起。冰河時期到來。", "en": "The continents drifted. The mammals rose. The Ice Age came."}, {"zh-tw": "然後，在東非，一種看來沒出息的猿類出奇地在有情思維中進化出來。這些聰明的靈長類並非特別快速或強壯。", "en": "And then, in East Africa, an unpromising species of apeevolved the odd trick of sentient thought. These brainy primates were notparticularly fast or strong."}, {"zh-tw": "但它們擅長佔領土地，並利用出色的散居的方式，超越恐龍征服領土的紀錄，它們分佈在地球每一處，強佔了每一個遇到的生態系統，在過程中，它們創造出文化、金工、繪畫、舞蹈、音樂、還有科學，並用火箭載著12位特別傑出的猿人，飛到月球表面。有七十億人類在地球上來回走動，最終難免會有人踏上這巨獸的墳墓，在南巴塔哥尼亞貧瘠的地表下。", "en": "But they excelled at covering ground, and in a remarkable diaspora surpassing even the dinosaurs' recordof territorial conquest, they dispersed across the planet, ravishing every ecosystemthey encountered, along the way, inventing cultureand metalworking and painting and dance and music and science and rocket ships that would eventuallytake 12 particularly excellent apes to the surface of the Moon. With seven billion peripateticHomo sapiens on the planet, it was perhaps inevitable that one of them would eventuallytrod on the grave of the magnificent titan buried beneath the badlandsof Southern Patagonia."}, {"zh-tw": "我就是那個猿人。獨自站在那片沙漠上，我沒有忘記，每個人遇到化石的機會，是十分渺小的。", "en": "I was that ape. And standing there, alone in the desert, it was not lost on me that the chance of any one individualentering the fossil record is vanishingly small."}, {"zh-tw": "但地球非常的古老。而經過漫長的時間隧道，不可能成為可能。", "en": "But the Earth is very, very old. And over vast tracts of time,the improbable becomes the probable."}, {"zh-tw": "這就是地理的魔力。然而，大量的生物在這顆古老的星球上生存死亡留下了大量的化石，每一個體都是小小的奇蹟，但集體而言，則是必然的。", "en": "That's the magic of the geological record. Thus, multitudinous creaturesliving and dying on an old planet leave behind immense numbers of fossils, each one a small miracle, but collectively, inevitable."}, {"zh-tw": "六千六百萬年前，一顆小行星撞擊地球導致恐龍滅絕。再來一次，這很可能不會發生。", "en": "Sixty-six million years ago,an asteroid hits the Earth and wipes out the dinosaurs. This easily might not have been."}, {"zh-tw": "我們只有一個歷史，就是現在我們所有的。但是這個特定的現實不是必然會發生的。", "en": "But we only get one history,and it's the one that we have. But this particular realitywas not inevitable."}, {"zh-tw": "任何對那顆遙遠小隕石施加的微小擾動也能使它遠遠的錯過地球。關鍵、災難、滅絕恐龍的那一天，打造了我們熟知的現代世界，並不必然發生。", "en": "The tiniest perturbationof that asteroid far from Earth would have caused it to missour planet by a wide margin. The pivotal, calamitous day during whichthe dinosaurs were wiped out, setting the stagefor the modern world as we know it didn't have to be."}, {"zh-tw": "它也可以是另外一天 --也許是星期四 --在恐龍已經享有的六百三十億個日子中的一天。但是在地理時間中，這不可能的，幾乎是不可能的事情確實發生了。", "en": "It could've just been another day -- a Thursday, perhaps -- among the 63 billion daysalready enjoyed by the dinosaurs. But over geological time, improbable, nearly impossible events do occur."}, {"zh-tw": "從我們低賤的寒武紀祖先，到西裝革履的人類，無數條分岔路引領我們到這個特定的現實。無畏龍的骨骸躺在地下已七千七百萬年。", "en": "Along the path from our wormy,Cambrian ancestors to primates dressed in suits, innumerable forks in the roadled us to this very particular reality. The bones of Dreadnoughtuslay underground for 77 million years."}, {"zh-tw": "誰又能想像到那如同潑婦一般的哺乳動物在恐龍時期只能在夾縫中求生存如今已進化成有智慧的生物，能分析和理解當初會讓他們懼怕的恐龍們。我曾站在密蘇里河的源頭然後跨過它。在那裡，它只不過是涓涓細流，從比特魯特山脈高處一處牧場裡的一塊岩石下所流出的一股水流。", "en": "Who could have imagined that a single species of shrew-like mammal living in the cracks of the dinosaur world would evolve into sentient beings capable of characterizingand understanding the very dinosaurs they must have dreaded? I once stood at the headof the Missouri River and bestraddled it. There, it's nothing morethan a gurgle of water that issues forth from beneath a rockin a boulder in a pasture, high in the Bitterroot Mountains."}, {"zh-tw": "它旁邊的小水流僅奔流了幾百碼就注入在一個小池子裡。這兩條看似相似的水流", "en": "The stream next to itruns a few hundred yards and ends in a small pond. Those two streams -- they look identical."}, {"zh-tw": "卻一條默默無聞，另一條則是密蘇里河。順流而下來到密蘇里河靠近聖路易斯的河口，顯然這是條大河。", "en": "But one is an anonymous trickle of water, and the other is the Missouri River. Now go down to the mouthof the Missouri, near St. Louis, and it's pretty obviousthat that river is a big deal."}, {"zh-tw": "但回到比特魯特山脈來看它，以人類的眼界並不能察覺到它的特殊性。再講回白堊紀看看我們渺小，毛球般的祖先。", "en": "But go up into the Bitterrootsand look at the Missouri, and human prospection does notallow us to see it as anything special. Now go back to the Cretaceous Period and look at our tiny, fuzzball ancestors."}, {"zh-tw": "你絕不能猜到他們將會特別有出息；若非那塊討厭的隕石，他們應該不會有。現在，就算另造一千個世界，和另外一千個太陽系，讓他們發展，", "en": "You would never guess that they would amountto anything special, and they probably wouldn't have, were it not for that pesky asteroid. Now, make a thousand more worldsand a thousand more solar systems and let them run."}, {"zh-tw": "你永遠不會得到一樣的結果。無庸置疑，這些世界會同樣精彩，令人難以置信，但是它們不可能有與我們相同的歷史。", "en": "You will never get the same result. No doubt, those worlds would beboth amazing and amazingly improbable, but they would not be our worldand they would not have our history."}, {"zh-tw": "這裡有無窮我們可能經歷的歷史，而我們只能有一個，哇，我們所得到的真好。", "en": "There are an infinite number of historiesthat we could've had.
