Engineering at the molecular level, working at the smallest of scales, can provide exciting new ways to fight the most aggressiveforms of cancer."}, {"zh-tw": "癌症是一種非常聰明的疾病。很幸運的，我們能運用現有的藥物和手術來有效地治療ㄧ些癌症。", "en": "Cancer is a very clever disease. There are some forms of cancer, which, fortunately, we've learnedhow to address relatively well with known and establisheddrugs and surgery."}, {"zh-tw": "但是針對其他的癌症，這些治療完全無效，腫瘤仍舊會繼續生存或者再度復發。即使我們持續投放最強烈的藥物。我們可以把那些非常具攻擊性的癌症，想像成漫畫書中的超級壞蛋。", "en": "But there are some forms of cancer that don't respond to these approaches, and the tumor survives or comes back, even after an onslaught of drugs. We can think of thesevery aggressive forms of cancer as kind of supervillains in a comic book."}, {"zh-tw": "它們既聰明，又善於適應環境，而且擅長求生。而且就像現今的超級壞蛋一樣，它們的超能力來自基因突變。", "en": "They're clever, they're adaptable, and they're very good at staying alive. And, like most supervillains these days, their superpowers comefrom a genetic mutation."}, {"zh-tw": "那些腫瘤細胞內變異的基因能夠編譯出一種嶄新、令人難以想像的生存模式，使癌細胞在歷經最好的化療之後仍然能夠存活下來。例如，癌細胞有一種基因能夠在藥物接近細胞還沒發揮作用之前，讓細胞把藥物推走。", "en": "The genes that are modifiedinside these tumor cells can enable and encode for newand unimagined modes of survival, allowing the cancer cell to live through even our best chemotherapy treatments. One example is a trickin which a gene allows a cell, even as the drug approaches the cell, to push the drug out, before the drug can have any effect."}, {"zh-tw": "你可以把它想像成細胞成功地把藥物吐出來。這只是超級壞蛋--癌症眾多基因把戲中的一個例子而已。", "en": "Imagine -- the cell effectivelyspits out the drug. This is just one exampleof the many genetic tricks in the bag of our supervillain, cancer."}, {"zh-tw": "原因皆是突變基因。當我們面對一個擁有驚人能力的超級壞蛋，", "en": "All due to mutant genes. So, we have a supervillainwith incredible superpowers."}, {"zh-tw": "我們需要一種嶄新而強勁的攻擊模式。實際上，我們可以讓基因無法運作。", "en": "And we need a new and powerfulmode of attack. Actually, we can turn off a gene."}, {"zh-tw": "其關鍵是一種被稱為siRNA的組分子，它是一種短遺傳密碼序列，它能使細胞阻斷某個特定基因。", "en": "The key is a set of moleculesknown as siRNA. siRNA are short sequences of genetic code that guide a cell to block a certain gene."}, {"zh-tw": "每個 siRNA 分子可以關閉細胞內一個特定的基因。自從發現它後，多年來科學家們都對基因阻斷器在醫療方面的應用很感興趣。", "en": "Each siRNA moleculecan turn off a specific gene inside the cell. For many years since its discovery, scientists have been very excited about how we can applythese gene blockers in medicine."}, {"zh-tw": "但是有一個問題：siRNA 在細胞裡運作良好，", "en": "But, there is a problem. siRNA works well inside the cell."}, {"zh-tw": "但是如果它接觸到存在於我們的血液或者身體組織中的酵素，它就會在瞬間降解。它在身體運行的旅途上需要被包裝，受到保護直到抵達最終目標--癌細胞裡面。", "en": "But if it gets exposed to the enzymes that reside in our bloodstreamor our tissues, it degrades within seconds. It has to be packaged, protectedthrough its journey through the body on its way to the final targetinside the cancer cell."}, {"zh-tw": "所以這是我們的策略：我們給癌細胞一劑 siRNA，也就是基因阻斷器，來抑制讓癌細胞存活的基因的表現，接著利用化學藥物把癌細胞擊垮。", "en": "So, here's our strategy. First, we'll dose the cancer cellwith siRNA, the gene blocker, and silence those survival genes, and then we'll whop it with a chemo drug."}, {"zh-tw": "但是我們怎樣進行呢？運用分子工程，我們可以設計出一種能在血液中自由游走的超級武器，它要小得可以穿過血流，穿過腫瘤組織，微小得可以留在癌細胞內。", "en": "But how do we carry that out? Using molecular engineering, we can actually design a superweapon that can travel through the bloodstream. It has to be tiny enoughto get through the bloodstream, it's got to be small enoughto penetrate the tumor tissue, and it's got to be tiny enoughto be taken up inside the cancer cell."}, {"zh-tw": "為了順利完成這個任務，它的大小必須是人類頭髮的百分之一。現在請近距離看看我們如何製造這個奈米粒子。", "en": "To do this job well, it has to be about one one-hundredththe size of a human hair. Let's take a closer lookat how we can build this nanoparticle."}, {"zh-tw": "首先由奈米粒子的核心開始。它是一只含有化療藥物的細小膠囊。", "en": "First, let's startwith the nanoparticle core. It's a tiny capsule that containsthe chemotherapy drug."}, {"zh-tw": "那是一種真正能結束癌細胞生命的毒藥。我們將會在這顆核心的周圍包裹一層非常薄的siRNA 奈米膜。", "en": "This is the poison that willactually end the tumor cell's life. Around this core, we'll wrap a very thin, nanometers-thin blanket of siRNA."}, {"zh-tw": "這是我們的基因阻斷器。因為 siRNA 是強力負極電荷，所以我們可以利用一層正極的聚合物保護膜來保護siRNA。", "en": "This is our gene blocker. Because siRNA is stronglynegatively charged, we can protect it with a nice, protective layerof positively charged polymer."}, {"zh-tw": "兩個異性電分子因為互相吸引繼而黏在一起，並提供了一層保護層防止 siRNA 在血流中降解。我們差不多完成了。", "en": "The two oppositely chargedmolecules stick together through charge attraction, and that provides uswith a protective layer that prevents the siRNAfrom degrading in the bloodstream. We're almost done."}, {"zh-tw": "但是我們還要考慮到一個大障礙。其實可能是所有障礙中最大的一個。", "en": "But there is one more big obstaclewe have to think about. In fact, it may be the biggestobstacle of all."}, {"zh-tw": "我們怎樣善用這種超級武器呢？每種優良的武器都需要瞄準目標。我們要把超級武器瞄準腫瘤內的超級壞蛋細胞。但是我們體內有一種天然的免疫防衛系統：血流裡有一種細胞能夠辨認出原本不存在於身體的東西，繼而破壞或消滅它們。", "en": "How do we deploy this superweapon? I mean, every good weaponneeds to be targeted, we have to target this superweaponto the supervillain cells that reside in the tumor. But our bodies have a naturalimmune-defense system: cells that reside in the bloodstream and pick out things that don't belong, so that it can destroy or eliminate them."}, {"zh-tw": "猜猜看怎麼了？我們的奈米粒子被視為一種外來物。我們要把奈米粒子偷渡過腫瘤防護系統時，", "en": "And guess what? Our nanoparticleis considered a foreign object. We have to sneak our nanoparticlepast the tumor defense system."}, {"zh-tw": "必須掩飾它，讓它通過身體排除外物的機制，於是我們再增加一層負極電膜，包圍這個奈米粒子，這有兩個目的。", "en": "We have to get it past this mechanismof getting rid of the foreign object by disguising it. So we add one morenegatively charged layer around this nanoparticle, which serves two purposes."}, {"zh-tw": "第一，外層是天然電荷，那是人體內的高水合多醣。它可以在奈米粒子周圍製造一層水分子。這有隱形斗蓬的效果。", "en": "First, this outer layer is oneof the naturally charged, highly hydrated polysaccharidesthat resides in our body. It creates a cloud of water moleculesaround the nanoparticle that gives us an invisibilitycloaking effect."}, {"zh-tw": "這隱形斗篷讓奈米粒子能夠藉著血液的流動，移動到足以到達腫瘤的距離，而不會被身體消滅。第二，這層高水合多醣含有可以和腫瘤細胞結合的分子。", "en": "This invisibility cloak allowsthe nanoparticle to travel through the bloodstream long and far enough to reach the tumor, without getting eliminated by the body. Second, this layer contains molecules which bind specifically to our tumor cell."}, {"zh-tw": "一旦結合了，癌細胞就會吸收奈米粒子。現在奈米粒子就在癌細胞的內部，準備展開行動了。好，我也有同感。出發吧！首先調動 siRNA。", "en": "Once bound, the cancer celltakes up the nanoparticle, and now we have our nanoparticleinside the cancer cell and ready to deploy. Alright! I feel the same way. Let's go! The siRNA is deployed first."}, {"zh-tw": "它需要數小時才見效。因為要足夠的時間去抑制癌細胞生存基因的表現，我們現在已經使這些基因的超能力無法運作。", "en": "It acts for hours, giving enough time to silenceand block those survival genes. We have now disabledthose genetic superpowers."}, {"zh-tw": "剩下來的是沒有特殊防禦的癌細胞。接下來，化療藥物從核心釋放，徹底且有效率地破壞腫瘤細胞。", "en": "What remains is a cancer cellwith no special defenses. Then, the chemotherapy drugcomes out of the core and destroys the tumor cellcleanly and efficiently."}, {"zh-tw": "只要我們有足夠的基因阻斷器，就能對付不同種類的突變，有機會能剿滅腫瘤，讓壞蛋一個也不剩地消失。所以我們的策略是如何進行的？我們利用動物測試這些奈米結構粒子，運用極具攻擊性的三陰性乳腺癌做實驗。", "en": "With sufficient gene blockers, we can address manydifferent kinds of mutations, allowing the chance to sweep out tumors, without leaving behind any bad guys. So, how does our strategy work? We've tested these nanostructureparticles in animals using a highly aggressive formof triple-negative breast cancer."}, {"zh-tw": "三陰性乳腺癌的基因表現讓癌症藥物一接近它就被排除。通常，阿黴素是治療乳癌第一線療程的藥物。", "en": "This triple-negative breast cancerexhibits the gene that spits out cancer drugas soon as it is delivered. Usually, doxorubicin -- let's callit \"dox\" -- is the cancer drug that is the first line of treatmentfor breast cancer."}, {"zh-tw": "於是我們首先只投放阿黴素來治療動物。腫瘤生長速度減緩了，但仍生長迅速，在兩週後，腫瘤的大小就增加了一倍。", "en": "So, we first treated our animalswith a dox core, dox only. The tumor slowed their rate of growth, but they still grew rapidly, doubling in sizeover a period of two weeks."}, {"zh-tw": "接下來，我們試了我們的綜合超級武器，用化療泵注射siRNA奈米粒子，加上，在內核放置阿黴素。", "en": "Then, we triedour combination superweapon. A nanolayer particle with siRNAagainst the chemo pump, plus, we have the dox in the core."}, {"zh-tw": "看！我們發現腫瘤不僅停止生長而且還縮小，有些腫瘤甚至完全消失腫瘤真的復原了。", "en": "And look -- we found that not onlydid the tumors stop growing, they actually decreased in size and were eliminated in some cases. The tumors were actually regressing."}, {"zh-tw": "這個方法最棒的地方是可以個人化。我們針對不同的突變和腫瘤的防護機制添加不同層次的 siRNA，", "en": "What's great about this approachis that it can be personalized. We can add many different layers of siRNA to address different mutationsand tumor defense mechanisms."}, {"zh-tw": "我們也可以把不同的藥物放進毫微粒核心。當醫生學習如何替病人檢測以及了解特定腫瘤的基因類型時，他們可以幫助我們決定哪類病人可以受惠於這個療法和採用哪種基因阻斷器。", "en": "And we can put different drugsinto the nanoparticle core. As doctors learn how to test patients and understand certaintumor genetic types, they can help us determine which patientscan benefit from this strategy and which gene blockers we can use."}, {"zh-tw": "卵巢癌對我而言具有特別的意義。它是一種很具攻擊性的癌症，部分原因是因為它通常在病症末期才被診斷出來，那時候癌細胞已經根深蒂固而且它有多種基因突變。", "en": "Ovarian cancer strikesa special chord with me. It is a very aggressive cancer, in part because it's discoveredat very late stages, when it's highly advanced and there are a numberof genetic mutations."}, {"zh-tw": "經過第一輪化療後，有 75％ 的病人會再次復發癌症。而且它通常會以抗藥性的型態回到身體。", "en": "After the first round of chemotherapy, this cancer comes backfor 75 percent of patients. And it usually comes backin a drug-resistant form."}, {"zh-tw": "惡性的卵巢癌是最壞的超級壞蛋之一。我們現在要把我們的超級武器瞄準它，", "en": "High-grade ovarian cancer is one of the biggestsupervillains out there. And we're now directing our superweapon toward its defeat."}, {"zh-tw": "希望能夠將它擊潰。作為一個研究員，我通常不會替病患做臨床治療。但最近我遇見一位卵巢癌倖存者媽媽Mimi和她的女兒Paige，", "en": "As a researcher, I usually don't get to work with patients. But I recently met a mother who is an ovarian cancer survivor,Mimi, and her daughter, Paige."}, {"zh-tw": "我深受他們母女兩人的樂觀和力量啟發，她們的故事展現了勇氣和互相扶持。在活動中，我們談論關於治療癌症的不同科技。", "en": "I was deeply inspiredby the optimism and strength that both mother and daughter displayed and by their story of courage and support. At this event, we spokeabout the different technologies directed at cancer."}, {"zh-tw": "Mimi 的雙眼泛淚她說她了解我們這些努力的成果可以讓她對下一代充滿了希望，包括她的親生女兒。這令我非常感動。", "en": "And Mimi was in tears as she explained how learningabout these efforts gives her hope for future generations, including her own daughter. This really touched me."}, {"zh-tw": "我們不只是做精密的科學研究，還能改變人們的人生。", "en": "It's not just about buildingreally elegant science. It's about changing people's lives."}, {"zh-tw": "這是在分子尺度中運用工程的力量。我知道在像Paige這樣的學生，在進入職涯後，他們會開創很多嶄新的可能性，來解決世界上的重大醫療衛生議題——包括卵巢癌、精神疾病、傳染病就像化學工程已為我開了一扇門，提供我世上最小的分子規模工程，來治癒世上大規模的人類。", "en": "It's about understandingthe power of engineering on the scale of molecules. I know that as students like Paigemove forward in their careers, they'll open new possibilities in addressing some of the bighealth problems in the world -- including ovarian cancer, neurologicaldisorders, infectious disease -- just as chemical engineering hasfound a way to open doors for me, and has provided a way of engineering on the tiniest scale,that of molecules, to heal on the human scale."}, {"zh-tw": "謝謝", "en": "Thank you."}], "title": "Paula Hammond A New Superweapon In The Fight Against Cancer"}
