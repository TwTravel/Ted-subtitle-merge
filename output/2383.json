I could access newspapersat any time and every day."}, {"zh-tw": "我甚至可以自己找資料,我真想幫助盲人們, 讓他們能可以使用網路,後來我發現把網頁轉為合成語音的方法,也大幅簡化使用者的介面.", "en": "I could even searchfor any information by myself. I desperately wanted to help the blindpeople have access to the Internet, and I found ways to render the webinto synthesized voice, which dramatically simplifiedthe user interface."}, {"zh-tw": "促使我在1997年創立了頁面閱讀器,起初只有日語，後來譯成11種語言.我在建立頁面閱讀器的時候,收到許多使用者回應", "en": "This led me to developthe Home Page Reader in 1997, first in Japanese and later,translated into 11 languages.
