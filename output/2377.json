As you pass through the portalbetween light and dark, you enter a subterranean world -- a place of perpetual gloom,of earthy smells, of hushed silence."}, {"zh-tw": "在很久以前的歐洲古人也曾經遊走過這地底世界作為他們旅程的印記他們留下了神秘的刻畫和壁畫像這組在西班牙Ojo Guareña的人形、三角形和鋸齒形的圖樣", "en": "Long ago in Europe, ancient people also enteredthese underground worlds. As witness to their passage, they left behind mysteriousengravings and paintings, like this panel of humans, trianglesand zigzags from Ojo Guareña in Spain."}, {"zh-tw": "你正追尋這些早期畫家的踪跡在這超乎現實世界之處幾乎難以想像你能夠聽到皮靴踩在鬆軟土地上那含糊的腳步聲或在下一個轉彎處看到火把的閃爍", "en": "You now walk the same pathas these early artists. And in this surreal, otherworldly place, it's almost possible to imagine that you hear the muffled footfallof skin boots on soft earth, or that you see the flickering of a torcharound the next bend."}, {"zh-tw": "當我在山洞裡我常常思考是甚麼東西推動這些人去深入如此險窄的通道來留下他們的印記？這段短片是在西班牙Cudon的一個山洞的前半個公里或者大概三分之一英里的地下道在某山洞頂部的一系列的紅色壁畫這區域從未被探究過當我們繼續往前的軍人式爬行，洞頂變得越來越低直到洞頂低到連我的丈夫和攝影師Dylan沒辦法用DSLR相機對焦到洞頂為止", "en": "When I'm in a cave, I often find myself wonderingwhat drove these people to go so deep to brave dangerous and narrowpassageways to leave their mark? In this video clip, that was shot half a kilometer,or about a third of a mile, underground, in the cave of Cudon in Spain, we found a seriesof red paintings on a ceiling in a previously unexploredsection of the cave. As we crawled forward, military-style,with the ceiling getting ever lower, we finally got to a pointwhere the ceiling was so low that my husbandand project photographer, Dylan, could no longer achieve focuson the ceiling with his DSLR camera."}, {"zh-tw": "所以當他在拍我的時候我一直尾隨紅壁畫的踪跡手裡持著單束光源還有一架留給這種特別時刻使用的傻瓜相機在地底半公里之深。", "en": "So while he filmed me, I kept following the trail of red paintwith a single light and a point-and-shoot camerathat we kept for that type of occasion. Half a kilometer underground."}, {"zh-tw": "天啊在那裡拿著電筒或石燈是要幹嘛？我是說，是我的話就很合理對吧？但你知道嗎？這就是我想要透過我的研究來解答的問題", "en": "Seriously. What was somebody doing down therewith a torch or a stone lamp? I mean -- me, it makes sense, right? But you know, this is the kind of question thatI'm trying to answer with my research."}, {"zh-tw": "我研究的是世上最古老的藝術之一皆出自於歐洲的早期畫家的手中大約是一萬到四萬年前", "en": "I study some of the oldestart in the world. It was created by theseearly artists in Europe, between 10,000 and 40,000 years ago."}, {"zh-tw": "而事實上我不是衝著它們的美而去研究的雖然某部分是我感興趣的是現代思維的發展創意、想像力和抽象思維的演進以及作為人類的真諦", "en": "And the thing is that I'm not just studying itbecause it's beautiful, though some of it certainly is. But what I'm interested inis the development of the modern mind, of the evolution of creativity,of imagination, of abstract thought, about what it means to be human."}, {"zh-tw": "雖然所有的生物各自利用自己的方式互相溝通唯有人類的溝通方式真正鶴立雞群我們對於分享與合作的嚮往和能力成為了人類成功的基石", "en": "While all species communicatein one way or another, only we humans have reallytaken it to another level. Our desire and abilityto share and collaborate has been a huge part of our success story."}, {"zh-tw": "我們的現代世界建立在全球化的資訊交換網絡之上一大部分緣於我們溝通的能力--特別是圖像跟文字的溝通儘管如此我們承接的是古人的思想成就以致於我們容易忘記有些能力並非該時代的範疇", "en": "Our modern world is based on a globalnetwork of information exchange made possible, in large part,by our ability to communicate -- in particular, using graphicor written forms of communication. The thing is, though, that we've been buildingon the mental achievements of those that came before us for so long that it's easy to forget that certainabilities haven't already existed."}, {"zh-tw": "這是我深入我們的歷史以來發現到最有趣的體悟。那些人根本沒有巨人的肩膀可以站", "en": "It's one of the thingsI find most fascinating about studying our deep history. Those people didn't have the shouldersof any giants to stand on."}, {"zh-tw": "他們就是最原始的巨人肩膀而雖然大量的重要發明出自於那遠古的時代我想要跟你分享的是圖像溝通的發明", "en": "They were the original shoulders. And while a surprising numberof important inventions come out of that distant time, what I want to talk to you about todayis the invention of graphic communication."}, {"zh-tw": "主要的溝通方式一共有三種口語手勢--像手語之類的以及圖像溝通口語和手勢的溝通本質上是短暫的", "en": "There are threemain types of communication, spoken, gestural --so things like sign language -- and graphic communication. Spoken and gestural areby their very nature ephemeral."}, {"zh-tw": "訊息的傳送需要近距離的接觸而訊息只要傳送完畢就會永遠消失", "en": "It requires close contactfor a message to be sent and received. And after the momentof transmission, it's gone forever."}, {"zh-tw": "反之，圖像溝通打斷這種關係自從圖像溝通問世，我們首次能夠讓訊息的傳送和留存超越當下的時空限制", "en": "Graphic communication, on the other hand,decouples that relationship. And with its invention,it became possible for the first time for a message to betransmitted and preserved beyond a single moment in place and time."}, {"zh-tw": "歐洲是我們最早發現在岩壁、岩棚甚至一些僅存的開放區域有圖樣記號規律出現的地方但這不是我們所認識的現代歐洲", "en": "Europe is one of the first places that we start to see graphic marksregularly appearing in caves, rock sheltersand even a few surviving open-air sites. But this is not the Europe we know today."}, {"zh-tw": "那是一個被高聳的冰原充滿的世界各個都三到四公里高被大片的草原和凍原覆蓋這，就是冰河時期", "en": "This was a world dominatedby towering ice sheets, three to four kilometers high, with sweeping grass plainsand frozen tundra. This was the Ice Age."}, {"zh-tw": "自從上個世紀以來超過350個冰河時期的石畫區在歐洲大陸被發掘出來其中刻有動物、抽象圖案甚至一些少見的人類圖案像這些在西西里的阿達拉山洞(Grotta dell'Addaura)看到的雕刻它們讓我們一窺這些早期畫家的創意和想像力", "en": "Over the last century, more than 350 Ice Age rock art siteshave been found across the continent, decorated with animals, abstract shapesand even the occasional human like these engraved figuresfrom Grotta dell'Addaura in Sicily. They provide us with a rare glimpse into the creative world and imaginationof these early artists."}, {"zh-tw": "自從發掘出它們動物雕刻圖一直都是研究的焦點像這匹在西班牙的古拉維拉(Cullalvera)找到的黑馬圖或是這隻在帕斯加(La Pasiega)看到的奇特紫水牛但對我而言，反而是抽像圖案，所謂的幾何圖形燃起了我研究這類藝術的興趣。", "en": "Since their discovery, it's been the animals that have receivedthe majority of the study like this black horsefrom Cullalvera in Spain, or this unusual purple bisonfrom La Pasiega. But for me, it was the abstract shapes,what we call geometric signs, that drew me to study the art."}, {"zh-tw": "詭異的是，在大部分的地點幾何圖形的數量遠超於動物和人類的圖案可是我在2007年開始從事研究時這些圖案根本沒有明確的數量和清單更沒有人有興趣去知道究竟不同的時間、地點有否出現過相似的圖案", "en": "The funny this is that at most sites the geometric signs far outnumberthe animal and human images. But when I started on this back in 2007, there wasn't even a definitive listof how many shapes there were, nor was there a strong sense of whether the same onesappeared across space or time."}, {"zh-tw": "在我還未開始解除我的疑惑之前需要先編輯一個資料庫來包含所有石畫地點的所有幾何圖形問題是，雖然在某些地點的圖案非常明確這通常都是那些可愛的動物圖案，仍有一大部分仍然非常含糊不清--根本沒有細節或註解可以參考", "en": "Before I could evenget started on my questions, my first step was to compile a database of all known geometric signsfrom all of the rock art sites. The problem was that while they werewell documented at some sites, usually the oneswith the very nice animals, there was also a large number of themwhere it was very vague -- there wasn't a lotof description or detail."}, {"zh-tw": "有些甚至超過半世紀以來都杳無人跡這些就是我實地考察的重點", "en": "Some of them hadn't been visitedin half a century or more. These were the onesthat I targeted for my field work."}, {"zh-tw": "兩年過去了我不離不棄的丈夫跟我一起在地底下花了超過300小時在位於法國、西班牙和西西里的52個山洞攀越和爬行這完全是划得來的", "en": "Over the course of two years, my faithful husband Dylan and Ieach spent over 300 hours underground, hiking, crawling and wrigglingaround 52 sites in France, Spain, Portugal and Sicily. And it was totally worth it."}, {"zh-tw": "在去過的75%地點中我們發現全新、不見經傳的幾何圖形我深知我正需要這種精確的程度來回答更重要的問題", "en": "We found new, undocumented geometric signsat 75 percent of the sites we visited. This is the level of accuracyI knew I was going to need if I wanted to start answeringthose larger questions."}, {"zh-tw": "那讓我們去尋找答案吧排除一堆異類之外，剩下32中幾何圖形", "en": "So let's get to those answers. Barring a handful of outliers,there are only 32 geometric signs."}, {"zh-tw": "歷遍三萬年的時間，橫跨整個歐洲版圖只有32個符號多麼渺小的數字啊", "en": "Only 32 signs across a 30,000-year time spanand the entire continent of Europe. That is a very small number."}, {"zh-tw": "如果這些只是隨意的塗鴉或裝飾理論上應該會看到更多樣化的圖案可是我們發現同樣的符號經年累月的在各地不斷的重複著有些符號先盛後衰有些則是比較後期的創作", "en": "Now, if these were randomdoodles or decorations, we would expect to seea lot more variation, but instead what we findare the same signs repeating across both space and time. Some signs start out strong,before losing popularity and vanishing, while other signs are later inventions."}, {"zh-tw": "但65%的符號在那段時間內不斷的出現--比如線條、四方形三角形、橢圓形和圓形接近冰河時期末開始出現在庇里牛斯山上的萬年山洞有些符號的分佈範圍長達幾千公里有些的分佈則比較受限甚至當中只分佈在單一區域像這些被劃分的四方形只出現在北西班牙而有些學者認為這些可能是家族或氏族的象徵符號", "en": "But 65 percent of those signs stayedin use during that entire time period -- things like lines, rectanglestriangles, ovals and circles like we see herefrom the end of the Ice Age, at a 10,000-year-old sitehigh in the Pyrenees Mountains. And while certain signsspan thousands of kilometers, other signs had much morerestricted distribution patterns, with some being limitedto a single territory, like we see herewith these divided rectangles that are only found in northern Spain, and which some researchers have speculated could be some sortof family or clan signs."}, {"zh-tw": "順帶一提從法國到西班牙以及自印尼到澳洲出現的早期石畫的相似度驚人地高當中相同的符號在相隔很遠的地方同時出現尤其在三萬到四萬年前這段時間內我越來越認為這些創作的共同發源地能夠追朔到非洲", "en": "On a side note, there is surprising degreeof similarity in the earliest rock art found all the way from France and Spainto Indonesia and Australia. With many of the same signsappearing in such far-flung places, especially in that 30,000to 40,000-year range, it's starting to seem increasingly likely that this invention actually traces backto a common point of origin in Africa."}, {"zh-tw": "但恐怕那又會是下次演講的主題那我們回過頭來看看", "en": "But that I'm afraid,is a subject for a future talk. So back to the matter at hand."}, {"zh-tw": "無疑的，這些符號對於其創作者意義深遠例如這兩萬五千年在法國弗納斯屈厄山洞(La Roque de Venasque)的淺浮雕我們可能不知道它們的意義但那時的人肯定知道", "en": "There could be no doubt that these signswere meaningful to their creators, like these 25,000-year-oldbas-relief sculptures from La Roque de Venasque in France. We might not know what they meant,but the people of the time certainly did."}, {"zh-tw": "這些符號長時間以來，在各個地點的重複告訴我們這些畫家清楚知道自己在做什麼如果我們談論的是具體、具文化認同感和共識的幾何圖形那在我們眼前的很可能是世上最古老的圖案溝通系統之一", "en": "The repetition of the same signs,for so long, and at so many sites tells us that the artistswere making intentional choices. If we're talking about geometric shapes, with specific, culturally recognized,agreed-upon meanings, than we could very well be looking at one of the oldest systemsof graphic communication in the world."}, {"zh-tw": "當然這還稱不上的文字這裡的符號數量沒有多到可以代表所有口述的詞彙要知道這是完整書寫系統的必要因素", "en": "I'm not talking about writing yet. There's just not enoughcharacters at this point to have represented all of the wordsin the spoken language, something which is a requirementfor a full writing system."}, {"zh-tw": "同時這些符號的規律性還不至於能讓我們覺得它們是一種文字但我們卻發現到一些比較新奇 只出現一次的符號例如這個在西班牙的帕斯加(La Pasiega)出現的圖案，叫做『銘文』(The Inscription)左邊有對稱的筆劃中間可能是雙手的風格化圖案還有右邊看似掛號的符號", "en": "Nor do we see the signsrepeating regularly enough to suggest that they weresome sort of alphabet. But what we do haveare some intriguing one-offs, like this panel from La Pasiega in Spain,known as \"The Inscription,\" with its symmetrical markings on the left, possible stylized representationsof hands in the middle, and what looks a bitlike a bracket on the right."}, {"zh-tw": "世上最古老的圖案溝通--蘇美的楔形文字、埃及的象形文字以及中國的漢字皆在四五千年前出現每一個都萌芽於更早期的原型由數字記號和象形符號組成當中的意義和圖形是相符的鳥的圖形顧名思義就是鳥的意思", "en": "The oldest systems of graphiccommunication in the world -- Sumerian cuneiform, Egyptian hieroglyphs,the earliest Chinese script, all emerged between 4,000and 5,000 years ago, with each coming into existencefrom an earlier protosystem made up of counting marksand pictographic representations, where the meaningand the image were the same. So a picture of a bird would reallyhave represented that animal."}, {"zh-tw": "到後期的時候這些象形符號才變得更風格化直到難以辨認還有更多的符號陸續被發明來代表該語言中其餘的文字--比如代名詞、副詞、形容詞總而言之看來冰河時期歐洲的幾何圖形不太像是抽象的符號", "en": "It's only later that we start to seethese pictographs become more stylized, until they almost become unrecognizable and that we also start to seemore symbols being invented to represent all those othermissing words in language -- things like pronouns, adverbs, adjectives. So knowing all this, it seems highly unlikely thatthe geometric signs from Ice Age Europe were truly abstract written characters."}, {"zh-tw": "相反，有很高的可能性這些早期的畫家其實是在書寫數字記號像這些在西西里Riparo di Za Minic的線條又或者是在創造或風格化他們周遭的事物是否有些代表著武器或建築？或是天體，如星座之類的？甚至是河流、山川、樹木--自然景觀像是這些被奇怪的鐘狀符號圍繞著的黑色羽狀符號出現於西班牙的卡斯蒂略金字塔（El Castillo)", "en": "Instead, what's much more likely is that these early artistswere also making counting marks, maybe like this row of linesfrom Riparo di Za Minic in Sicily, as well as creatingstylized representations of things from the world around them. Could some of the signsbe weaponry or housing? Or what about celestial objectslike star constellations? Or maybe even rivers, mountains,trees -- landscape features, possibly like this black penniformsurrounded by strange bell-shaped signs from the site of El Castillo in Spain."}, {"zh-tw": "Penniform 在拉丁文裡是『羽狀』的意思但有沒有可能這其實是一種植物或樹木的示意圖？有些學者已經開始針對這些特定地點找到的符號提出疑問了但我相信是時候讓我們整體性的重溫這主題了諷刺的是當我精心的把這些符號歸納成一個類別我有預感下一步就是拆散它們來應付不同的符號的辨識和區分", "en": "The term penniformmeans \"feather-shaped\" in Latin, but could this actually bea depiction of a plant or a tree? Some researchers have begunto ask these questions about certain signs at specific sites, but I believe the time has cometo revisit this category as a whole. The irony in all of this, of course, is that having just carefully classifiedall of the signs into a single category, I have a feeling that my next stepwill involve breaking it back apart as different types of imageryare identified and separated off."}, {"zh-tw": "請不要誤會一個完整的書寫系統在後期所發明的文字本身確實是個令人敬佩的貢獻。但切記早期的書寫系統並不是無中生有的", "en": "Now don't get me wrong, the later creationof fully developed writing was an impressive feat in its own right. But it's important to remember that those early writing systemsdidn't come out of a vacuum."}, {"zh-tw": "即便是五千年前人們已經在更古老的東西上創造新的事物其根源可以追朔到千萬年前--到冰河時期歐洲的幾何圖形甚至更久遠以前直到最初始的那個當下有個人心血來潮畫出一個圖形符號而永遠改變了我們溝通的性質謝謝", "en": "And that even 5,000 years ago, people were already buildingon something much older, with its origins stretching backtens of thousands of years -- to the geometric signsof Ice Age Europe and far beyond, to that point, deepin our collective history, when someone first came up with the ideaof making a graphic mark, and forever changed the natureof how we communicate.
