Well, you don't knowbecause you couldn't understand it. It wasn't clear."}, {"zh-tw": "但希望它說得夠有說服力，至少可以是很吸引人的神祕。清晰還是神秘?身為一個圖像設計師，我每天都必須在工作中平衡這兩者；身為一個紐約客，讓我每天也得在生活中平衡這兩者。而這就是非常吸引我的兩個元素。", "en": "But hopefully, it was saidwith enough conviction that it was at leastalluringly mysterious. Clarity or mystery? I'm balancing these two thingsin my daily work as a graphic designer, as well as my daily life as a New Yorker every day, and there are two elementsthat absolutely fascinate me."}, {"zh-tw": "這個有個範例。有多少人知道這是什麼？好，現在又有多少人知道這是什麼？好，感謝天才查爾斯·舒茲另外兩條靈巧的筆畫，我們現在擁有七條靈巧的筆劃可以組合而成整個情感生活，在過去的五十多年中讓好幾億的粉絲深深著迷。", "en": "Here's an example. Now, how many people know what this is? Okay. Now how many peopleknow what this is? Okay. Thanks to two more deft strokesby the genius Charles M.

Clarity gets to the point."}, {"zh-tw": "它是率真的、誠實的、誠懇的。我們這樣問自己。(你什麼時候需要清晰?)現在，例如這個，無論我們能否看懂，它都必須非常非常清楚。", "en": "It's blunt. It's honest. It's sincere.

This is a rather recent exampleof urban clarity that I just love, mainly because I'm always lateand I am always in a hurry.

And sure enough, not long after, one evening after a Chinese meal, this arrived, and I thought,\"Ah, bing, ideagasm!\" I've always loved the hilariouslymysterious tropes of fortune cookies that seem to mean something extremely deep but when you think about them -- if youthink about them -- they really don't. This says, \"Hardly anyone knows how muchis gained by ignoring the future.\" Thank you."}, {"zh-tw": "但我們可以把這個視覺方言用在塞德里先生的著作上，而因為我們都很熟悉幸運餅乾裡的籤語的長相，我們甚至不用讓任何一塊餅乾出現。我們只要看到這個奇怪的東西，我們也知道我們都愛大衛·塞德里，自然就會期待可以享受閱讀這本書。", "en": "But we can take this visual vernacularand apply it to Mr. Sedaris, and we are so familiarwith how fortune cookie fortunes look that we don't even needthe bits of the cookie anymore.

So he was this skinny little urban guy and GQ magazine would send himdown the Colorado River whitewater rafting to seeif he would survive."}, {"zh-tw": "然後他必須描寫這段經歷，這讓他覺得自己是個騙子、並感到自我扭曲。所以我也希望這本書的封面也有自我扭曲的感覺，然後讓讀者不知不覺地有所反應。", "en": "And then he would write about it,and he felt that he was a fraud and that he was misrepresenting himself. And so I wanted the cover of this bookto also misrepresent itself and then somehow showa reader reacting to it."}, {"zh-tw": "這讓我想到路旁的塗鴉。我對塗鴉一向著迷。", "en": "This led me to graffiti. I'm fascinated by graffiti."}, {"zh-tw": "我相信任何住在都市環境裡的人一定隨時都看得到塗鴉，而且還有許多不同類型。這是我在下東城一帶拍到的路旁一個變電箱的照片，它已經被畫得亂七八糟。", "en": "I think anybody who livesin an urban environment encounters graffiti all the time,and there's all different sorts of it. This is a picture I tookon the Lower East Side of just a transformer box on the sidewalk and it's been tagged like crazy."}, {"zh-tw": "無論你看到這個，心裡想的是：「喔，這真是個迷人的城市裝飾」還是「這是非法濫用公家財產」，我們都得同意的事實是，你無法讀懂它。對吧? 沒有任何清楚的訊息在裡面。", "en": "Now whether you look at this and think,\"Oh, that's a charming urban affectation,\" or you look at it and say,\"That's illegal abuse of property,\" the one thing I think we can all agree on is that you cannot read it. Right? There is no clear message here."}, {"zh-tw": "但有我發現有另一種塗鴉更加有趣，我稱為社論性塗鴉。這是一張我最近在地鐵站拍到的照片，有時候你會看到許多淫穢、愚蠢的東西，但我想這個很有趣，這張海報上寫著Airbnb怎樣怎樣，然後有人拿了支麥克筆，把它改成他們心裡想說的話。", "en": "There is another kind of graffitithat I find far more interesting, which I call editorial graffiti. This is a picture I took recentlyin the subway, and sometimes you seelots of prurient, stupid stuff, but I thought this was interesting,and this is a poster that is saying rah-rah Airbnb, and someone has taken a Magic Marker and has editorialized aboutwhat they think about it."}, {"zh-tw": "這吸引了我的注意。我想著，這是否能應用在這本書上?所以我拿著這個人寫的書、開始閱讀，然後我想著，這傢伙不像他自己說的那樣；他是個騙子。", "en": "And it got my attention. So I was thinking, how do weapply this to this book? So I get the book by this person,and I start reading it, and I'm thinking, this guy is not who he says he is; he's a fraud."}, {"zh-tw": "所以我拿了支紅色麥克筆，出於煩躁地在封面上亂畫。設計完成。", "en": "And I get out a red Magic Marker, and out of frustration justscribble this across the front. Design done."}, {"zh-tw": "而且他們接受了！作者喜歡、出版社也喜歡，這本書就是這樣出現在世界上的，而在地鐵上看到大家讀著這本書、拿著它走來走去真的很逗趣，它們全都看起來有點像瘋子。(詹姆士 ·艾洛伊的小說《背叛》)好的，詹姆士 ·艾洛伊，很棒的犯罪小說作家，同時也是我的好友，我們合作好多年了。", "en": "And they went for it! Author liked it, publisher liked it, and that is how the bookwent out into the world, and it was really fun to seepeople reading this on the subway and walking around with itand what have you, and they all sort of lookedlike they were crazy.

Confidential.\" His most recent novel was called this,which is a very mysterious name that I'm sure a lot of people knowwhat it means, but a lot of people don't. And it's a story about a Japanese-Americandetective in Los Angeles in 1941 investigating a murder."}, {"zh-tw": "而不久後，珍珠港事件爆發，彷彿他的生活還不夠艱難似的，種族衝突又變得愈發激烈，日裔美籍拘留營很快地成立，局勢非常緊張；而最糟糕的事情是他還沒放棄破解這樁謀殺案。所以我第一個想法非常直接，就是，好吧，我們就把珍珠港和洛杉磯市景放在一起，把這個末日景象放在城市的地平線上。", "en": "And then Pearl Harbor happens, and as if his lifewasn't difficult enough, now the race relationshave really ratcheted up, and then the Japanese-Americaninternment camps are quickly created, and there's lots of tension and horrible stuff as he's stilltrying to solve this murder. And so I did at first thinkvery literally about this in terms of all right, we'll take Pearl Harborand we'll add it to Los Angeles and we'll make this apocalyptic dawnon the horizon of the city."}, {"zh-tw": "所以這張珍珠港事件的照片直接被移植在洛杉磯之上。我們總編說：「呃，這很有趣，但我想應該還能更好，你應該能讓它更簡單。」所以我回到畫板前，一如往常。", "en": "And so that's a picture from Pearl Harbor just grafted onto Los Angeles. My editor in chief said,\"You know, it's interesting but I think you can do betterand I think you can make it simpler.\" And so I went backto the drawing board, as I often do."}, {"zh-tw": "與此同時，注意我周遭的環境，我在中城區的一棟高樓裡工作，每天晚上，在我離開辦公室前，必須先按下這個按鈕才能出去，厚重的玻璃門才會打開，而我才能進到電梯裡。某天晚上，忽然之間我看著這個按鈕，並開始用過去不曾注意過的方式看它。", "en": "But also, being alive to my surroundings, I work in a high-rise in Midtown, and every night,before I leave the office, I have to push this button to get out, and the big heavy glass doors openand I can get onto the elevator.

And I thought this was so obvious that it had to have beendone a zillion times, and so I did a Google image search,and I couldn't find another book cover that looked quite like this, and so this is reallywhat solved the problem, and graphically it's more interesting and creates a bigger tensionbetween the idea of a certain kind of sunrisecoming up over L.A. and America."}, {"zh-tw": "(瑪莉‧羅曲的《大吞一口，然後呢?》－ 一場人體消化系統之旅)瑪莉‧羅曲是個很棒的作家，她擅長把可以很單調的科學主題變得一點都不單調、變得非常有趣。所以這個案子是和人體消化系統有關。", "en": "[\"'Gulp' A tour of the humandigestive system by Mary Roach.\"] Mary Roach is an amazing writer who takes potentially mundanescientific subjects and makes them not mundane at all;she makes them really fun.

But I think what we can all agree on is that actual photographsof human mouths, at least based on this, are off-putting."}, {"zh-tw": "所以為了這個封面，我畫了一張插畫，看起來實在比較可口，同時也提醒我們，要探討消化系統，最好還是從這端。我甚至不必說出下半句。", "en": "So for the cover, then,I had this illustration done which is literally more palatable and reminds us that it's bestto approach the digestive system from this end.
