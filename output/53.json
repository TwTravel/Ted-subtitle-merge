However, when we're not at TED,we are often told that a real sustainability policy agendais just not feasible, especially in large urban areaslike New York City."}, {"zh-tw": "這是因為大部分有決策權的人，不管是在公家單位或是私人企業，全都不知道自己已身處險境。今天我之所以會在這裡，有一部分是因為一隻狗，一隻我1998年的一場大雨裡，帶回家的一隻流浪小狗。", "en": "And that's because most peoplewith decision-making powers, in both the public and the private sector, really don't feelas though they're in danger. The reason why I'm here today,in part, is because of a dog -- an abandoned puppy I foundback in the rain, back in 1998."}, {"zh-tw": "她後來長的比我預期的還要大很多。當她加入我的生活時，我們正在抗議一個龐大的廢棄物處理廠的設置，他們計畫設在河東濱水區，完全不考慮我們這個區域已經為整個紐約市處理了超過四成的商業廢棄物。一座污水處理廠、一座淤泥處理廠、四座發電廠、加上世界上最大的食品分銷中心，還有其他產業，每週有超過6萬趟柴油卡車來到這個區域。", "en": "She turned out to bea much bigger dog than I'd anticipated. When she came into my life, we werefighting against a huge waste facility planned for the East River waterfront despite the fact thatour small part of New York City already handled more than 40 percentof the entire city's commercial waste: a sewage treatment pelletizing plant,a sewage sludge plant, four power plants, the world's largestfood-distribution center, as well as other industries that bringmore than 60,000 diesel truck trips to the area each week."}, {"zh-tw": "這一區同時也是全市公園對人口比最低的地方。所以當公園單位找上我，要我進行一項初始規模只有1萬美金的計畫，來發展濱水區域，我真的覺得他們的想法很有意義，但是太過天真了點。", "en": "The area also has one of the lowest ratiosof parks to people in the city. So when I was contactedby the Parks Department about a $10,000 seed-grant initiativeto help develop waterfront projects, I thought they were reallywell-meaning, but a bit naive."}, {"zh-tw": "我從小到大都住在這一區，但卻從不能走到河邊，因為河邊有我剛才提到的那些工廠。有一天早晨，我帶我的狗慢跑時，她把我拉到一個我以為只是個違法傾倒廢物的地方。", "en": "I'd lived in this area all my life,and you could not get to the river, because of all the lovely facilitiesthat I mentioned earlier. Then, while joggingwith my dog one morning, she pulled me into what I thoughtwas just another illegal dump."}, {"zh-tw": "到處都是成堆的垃圾，和其他我不會在這裡提到的東西，但她還是把我往前拖，像是在說：看，最後面就是河了！我知道這條早已被遺忘的巷尾，就像那隻帶我到這裡來、被遺棄的狗一樣被人遺忘，但我們應該拯救它。", "en": "There were weeds and piles of garbageand other stuff that I won't mention here, but she kept dragging me, and lo and behold, at the endof that lot was the river. I knew that this forgottenlittle street-end, abandoned like the dog that broughtme there, was worth saving."}, {"zh-tw": "我知道有一天這裡將會成為一個令人驕傲的起步點，成為南布朗克斯區重生的象徵。而像我的狗一樣，這個構想變得比我想像的還要大。", "en": "And I knew it would growto become the proud beginnings of the community-led revitalizationof the new South Bronx. And just like my new dog, it was an ideathat got bigger than I'd imagined."}, {"zh-tw": "我們在一路上獲得了許多的幫助。獵點河濱公園於是成為南布朗克斯區60年來第一座親水公園，我們將初始規模只有1萬美金的計畫，建成了300倍規模的3百萬美金的公園，", "en": "We garnered much support along the way, and the Hunts Point Riverside Parkbecame the first waterfront park that the South Bronx had hadin more than 60 years.

But those of us livingin environmental justice communities are the canary in the coal mine."}, {"zh-tw": "我們現在就有環保的問題，而且已經持續一陣子了。環境正義，如果你們有些人不太了解這個名詞的話，它的意思是：沒有一個社區應該比其他社區負擔更多的污染，卻比其他人獲取更少的環境利益。", "en": "We feel the problems right now,and have for some time. Environmental justice, for those of youwho may not be familiar with the term, goes something like this: no community should be saddledwith more environmental burdens and less environmental benefitsthan any other."}, {"zh-tw": "但不幸的是，種族和階級常常是最可靠的指標，可以用來判斷什麼人會有好東西，像是公園和樹木，以及什麼人會有不好的東西，像發電廠或廢棄物處理廠。而在美國生為一個黑人，我比白人多出兩倍的機會，會去住在一個會威脅我健康的空氣污染社區中。", "en": "Unfortunately, race and classare extremely reliable indicators as to where one might find the good stuff,like parks and trees, and where one might find the bad stuff,like power plants and waste facilities.

These land-use decisionscreated the hostile conditions that lead to problems like obesity,diabetes and asthma."}, {"zh-tw": "誰會願意離開家裡到充滿毒物的社區裡散步呢？我們的社區居民有27％過胖，這個比率就算以全國來說也算是高的，糖尿病則跟著肥胖而來，而每四個南布朗克斯區的小孩中，就有一個有氣喘。", "en": "Why would someone leave their home to gofor a brisk walk in a toxic neighborhood? Our 27 percent obesity rateis high even for this country, and diabetes comes with it. One out of four South Bronxchildren has asthma."}, {"zh-tw": "我們的氣喘住院率比全國平均高七倍。這些嚴重地衝擊到我們社區的每個人身上，", "en": "Our asthma hospitalization rate is seven times higherthan the national average. These impacts are coming everyone's way."}, {"zh-tw": "每個人都為這些廢棄物的處理付出代價，甚至承受污染所帶來的健康問題，而更明顯的是，我們將年輕的黑人及拉丁裔男性囚禁起來的成本更是無法估計，因為他們擁有大量未經開發的潛能。這裡有半數的居民生活在貧窮線之下，四分之一的人沒有工作，而低收入的市民，", "en": "And we all pay dearlyfor solid waste costs, health problems associatedwith pollution and more odiously, the cost of imprisoningour young black and Latino men, who possess untold amountsof untapped potential. Fifty percent of our residentslive at or below the poverty line; 25 percent of us are unemployed."}, {"zh-tw": "則經常把急診室當成他們基本的醫療照顧。這些高額的成本都要由全體納稅人買單，但卻無法產生相對應的效益。", "en": "Low-income citizens often useemergency-room visits as primary care. This comes at a high cost to taxpayersand produces no proportional benefits."}, {"zh-tw": "貧窮的人不只是窮而已，他們的身體也很不健康。幸好，還是有許多像我一樣的人在為他們找尋解決之道，讓他們短期內不必再住在這種有色人種的低收入社區，長期來說，則要保護我們全體不受傷害。", "en": "Poor people are not only still poor,they are still unhealthy. Fortunately, there are many peoplelike me who are striving for solutions that won't compromise the lives of low-income communities of colorin the short term, and won't destroy us all in the long term."}, {"zh-tw": "大家都不想要這樣，但是我們卻同樣受苦。我們還有什麼相似的地方呢？首先，我們每個都非常的漂亮都有高中畢業、大學、研究生學位，", "en": "None of us want that,and we all have that in common.

Well, first of all,we're all incredibly good-looking."}, {"zh-tw": "到過有趣的地方旅遊，沒有在青少年時就懷孕，財富來源穩定，從來沒被關過。好。很好。", "en": "Graduated high school, college,post-graduate degrees, traveled to interesting places,didn't have kids in your early teens, financially stable, never been imprisoned. OK. Good."}, {"zh-tw": "但除了身為一位黑人女性，我在其他方面也和你們不同。我親眼目睹了社區裡將進半數的建築被火災焚毀。", "en": "But, besides being a black woman, I am different from most of youin some other ways. I watched nearly half of the buildingsin my neighborhood burn down."}, {"zh-tw": "我大哥藍尼打過越戰，卻在離我們家幾步路外被人槍殺。天啊！我住的地方對街就有人在販賣毒品。", "en": "My big brother Lenny fought in Vietnam, only to be gunned downa few blocks from our home. Jesus."}, {"zh-tw": "是的，我是一個貧民區裡的黑人小孩。", "en": "I grew up with a crack houseacross the street. Yeah, I'm a poor black childfrom the ghetto."}, {"zh-tw": "就是這些事情讓你我不同。但你我之間共通的事物，又使我和社區裡的其他人不同，我就像是活在兩個世界的中間，但我投入全部的心力去爭取公平正義。", "en": "These things make me different from you. But the things we have in common set me apart from mostof the people in my community, and I am in between these two worlds with enough of my heartto fight for justice in the other."}, {"zh-tw": "我們為什麼會有這麼大的差異？在40年代末期，我爸爸，他是普爾曼的搬運工，也是奴隸的兒子，在南布朗克斯的獵點社區買了一間房子，幾年後他娶了我媽媽。在那個年代，社區裡大多是白人勞工階級，", "en": "So how did things get so different for us? In the late '40s, my dad --a Pullman porter, son of a slave -- bought a house in the Hunts Pointsection of the South Bronx, and a few years later, he married my mom. At the time, the community was a mostlywhite, working-class neighborhood."}, {"zh-tw": "但我爸爸並不孤單。而當其他像他一樣的人們追求自己的美國夢時，白人遷離南布朗克斯區和其他城市，變成越來越普遍的現象。", "en": "My dad was not alone. And as others like him pursuedtheir own version of the American dream, white flight became commonin the South Bronx and in many cities around the country."}, {"zh-tw": "而那些白人遷離的區域，包括我們這一區，就被銀行畫了紅線，禁止任何投資。許多地主認為，把他們的建築用火燒掉，收取的保險費還比在那種狀況下賣掉來的好，完全不考慮房客的死傷。", "en": "Red-lining was used by banks,wherein certain sections of the city, including ours, were deemedoff-limits to any sort of investment. Many landlords believed it was moreprofitable to torch their buildings and collect insurance money ratherthan to sell under those conditions -- dead or injured former tenantsnotwithstanding."}, {"zh-tw": "獵點社區以前曾經是個可以走路去工作的社區，但現在當地的居民要不沒有工作，要不就是連家也沒有。後來全國性的高速公路擴張計畫，更使我們雪上加霜。", "en": "Hunts Point was formerlya walk-to-work community, but now residents had neitherwork nor home to walk to. A national highway construction boomwas added to our problems."}, {"zh-tw": "在紐約州，羅勃．莫斯提出了一個很有野心的高速公路擴張計畫，其中一個主要目的就是要讓比較富有的威徹斯特郡居民能夠更容易到達曼哈頓，", "en": "In New York State, Robert Moses spearheadedan aggressive highway-expansion campaign. One of its primary goals wasto make it easier for residents of wealthy communitiesin Westchester County to go to Manhattan."}, {"zh-tw": "但介於其中的南布朗克斯，則一點好處也沒有。居民們常常在自己的房子要被夷平前不到一個月才收到通知，", "en": "The South Bronx, which lies in between,did not stand a chance. Residents were often givenless than a month's notice before their buildings were razed."}, {"zh-tw": "有六萬居民被迫搬遷。大家都認為南布朗克斯區是色情行業的大本營，", "en": "600,000 people were displaced. The common perception was that only pimps and pushersand prostitutes were from the South Bronx."}, {"zh-tw": "但如果你在一出生，就有人告訴你社區裡沒有一樣好東西，全都是壞人和醜陋的勾當，這怎麼不會對你產生影響呢？我們的房子現在一點價值也沒有，只因為它是我們的家，也是我們唯一的財產所以才保存下來。我很幸運，能在這個家裡得到滿滿的愛，還有師長的協助，以及朋友的幫忙，這樣就夠了。", "en": "And if you are toldfrom your earliest days that nothing good is going to comefrom your community, that it's bad and ugly, how could it not reflect on you? So now, my family's propertywas worthless, save for that it was our home,and all we had. And luckily for me, that homeand the love inside of it, along with help from teachers, mentorsand friends along the way, was enough."}, {"zh-tw": "這個故事有什麼值得一提的地方嗎？就規劃的角度而言，經濟的衰退，會導致環境的衰敗，還會引發社會的動亂。而這種不投資於我們社區的策略始於1960年代，因此導致目前我們所看到環境上的不公不義的現象。", "en": "Now, why is this story important? Because from a planning perspective, economic degradationbegets environmental degradation, which begets social degradation. The disinvestment that beganin the 1960s set the stage for all the environmentalinjustices that were to come."}, {"zh-tw": "我們被視為被廢棄的區域，而不合時宜的土地使用法規仍在沿用，大家繼續在我們的社區設置污染的設施，在大家決定土地使用政策時，是否有將這些因素考慮在內呢？這種政策會需要付出什麼樣的代價呢？誰要來背負這些成本呢？誰又從中獲利？我們的社區有又得到了什麼好處？而這就是大家所謂的規畫，完全沒有把我們的利益考慮在內。", "en": "Antiquated zoning and land-useregulations are still used to this day to continue putting pollutingfacilities in my neighborhood. Are these factors taken into considerationwhen land-use policy is decided? What costs are associatedwith these decisions? And who pays? Who profits? Does anything justifywhat the local community goes through? This was \"planning\" -- in quotes -- that did not haveour best interests in mind."}, {"zh-tw": "一旦我們瞭解了這整件事，我們就決定要自己做規畫。我剛才告訴各位的小公園，只是我們開始建造南布朗克斯區綠色走廊的第一階段。", "en": "Once we realized that, we decidedit was time to do our own planning. That small park I told you about earlier was the first stage of buildinga Greenway movement in the South Bronx."}, {"zh-tw": "我撰寫了一個125萬美元的聯邦交通預算計畫，要設計一個設有腳踏車道的河濱步道。這個建設計畫，可以讓大眾瞭解交通安全的重要性，也瞭解到這附近設有廢棄物處理廠及其他相關設施，如果我們能處理妥當，就不必犠牲居民的生活品質。", "en": "I wrote a one-and-a-quarter-milliondollar federal transportation grant to design the planfor a waterfront esplanade with dedicated on-street bike paths. Physical improvements help informpublic policy regarding traffic safety, the placement of the wasteand other facilities, which, if done properly, don't compromisea community's quality of life."}, {"zh-tw": "這個計畫讓附近的民眾可以有機會出來活動，也可以為地方帶來繁榮。想想看，到時會有腳踏車店、果汁攤，", "en": "They provide opportunitiesto be more physically active, as well as local economic development. Think bike shops, juice stands."}, {"zh-tw": "我們保留了二千萬美金來做第一階段的計畫。這是拉法葉大道，將由馬修-尼爾森建築師事務所重新設計。", "en": "We secured 20 million dollarsto build first-phase projects. This is Lafayette Avenue -- and that's redesignedby Mathews Nielsen Landscape Architects."}, {"zh-tw": "而一旦這條大道修整完畢，它會將南布朗克斯區與超過400公畝的蘭德島公園連接在一起。現在，這中間被一條寬約25英呎的河流隔開，但這條道路將會改變這一點。", "en": "And once this path is constructed,it'll connect the South Bronx with more than 400 acresof Randall's Island Park. Right now we're separated by about 25 feetof water, but this link will change that."}, {"zh-tw": "只要我們復育這附近的自然環境，大自然就會回饋給我們更多。我們有一個名為布朗克斯生態講座的訓練，可以為民眾講解生態復育的相關知識，這樣我們社區的居民就可以和別人一起競爭那些高薪的職位了。", "en": "As we nurture the natural environment,its abundance will give us back even more. We run a project called the Bronx[Environmental] Stewardship Training, which provides job training in the fieldsof ecological restoration, so that folks from our communityhave the skills to compete for these well-paying jobs."}, {"zh-tw": "漸漸地，我們這附近就會有許多綠領的工作出現，這裡的居民就可以在自家附近獲取經濟與人脈優勢。在羅勃．莫斯的計畫裡有一條謝瑞登快速道路，將附近的社區一分為二，但目前的使用率不高，", "en": "Little by little, we're seedingthe area with green-collar jobs -- and with people that have botha financial and personal stake in their environment. The Sheridan Expresswayis an underutilized relic of the Robert Moses era, built with no regard for the neighborhoodsthat were divided by it."}, {"zh-tw": "即使在尖峰時段，都沒有什麼車通行，因此我們的社區提出一個替代方案，希望能將高速公路移除。", "en": "Even during rush hour,it goes virtually unused. The community createdan alternative transportation plan that allows for the removalof the highway."}, {"zh-tw": "現在我們有一個大好機會，可以將所有的利益關係人聚在一起，重新思考該怎麼利用這28英畝的土地，要放進公園、人們可以負擔得起的房子，還要兼顧當地的經濟發展。我們也在我們的辦公大樓上，建造了紐約市第一個綠能涼爽屋頂的示範。", "en": "We have the opportunity now to bringtogether all the stakeholders to re-envision how this 28 acrescan be better utilized for parkland, affordable housingand local economic development. We also built New York City's first greenand cool roof demonstration project on top of our offices."}, {"zh-tw": "涼爽屋頂的表面能有效反射太陽能所產生的熱，是可以阻絕建築物或空氣升溫的屋頂。綠能屋頂則是佈滿土壤和綠色植物的屋頂。", "en": "Cool roofs are highly-reflectivesurfaces that don't absorb solar heat, and pass it on tothe building or atmosphere. Green roofs are soil and living plants."}, {"zh-tw": "兩者都能取代原本以石油做為原料而做成的吸熱屋頂，這些屋頂會加重都市熱島效應，並在烈焰下漸漸變質，讓我們吸入有毒的空氣。但綠能屋頂可以儲存75%的雨水，讓都市人不必再花大錢來解決用水問題，而原本這些負擔都會加諸在我們這種社區上的。", "en": "Both can be used insteadof petroleum-based roofing materials that absorb heat, contributeto urban \"heat island\" effect and degrade under the sun, which we in turn breathe. Green roofs also retainup to 75 percent of rainfall, so they reduce a city's need to fundcostly end-of-pipe solutions -- which, incidentally, are often located in environmental justicecommunities like mine."}, {"zh-tw": "當然，這些屋頂也為我們的小小朋友提供了棲地！看......很酷吧！總之，這個示範計畫是我們綠能屋頂安裝事業的跳板，可以為南布朗克斯社區帶來工作機會，並持續供給經濟動能。我也很喜歡！", "en": "And they provide habitatsfor our little friends! [Butterfly] So cool! Anyway, the demonstrationproject is a springboard for our own green roofinstallation business, bringing jobs and sustainableeconomic activity to the South Bronx.
