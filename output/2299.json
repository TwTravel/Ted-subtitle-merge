And I was just a little kid,so I didn't really understand why, but as I got older, I realized we haddrug addiction in my family, including later cocaine addiction."}, {"zh-tw": "於是我開始認真思考，其中的一個理由是百年前美英兩國帶頭禁止毒品使用而且我們也在世界各地強制提倡反毒我們已經反毒整整一個世紀了不斷逼迫癮君子戒毒並施以峻罰因為我們相信這些手段可以阻止他們並且刺激他們戒毒", "en": "I'd been thinking about it a lot lately,partly because it's now exactly 100 years since drugs were first bannedin the United States and Britain, and we then imposed thaton the rest of the world. It's a century since we madethis really fateful decision to take addicts and punish themand make them suffer, because we believed that would deter them;it would give them an incentive to stop."}, {"zh-tw": "幾年前我看著那些沾染上毒品的家人朋友不斷思索著如何幫助他們最後我發現有一堆難以置信的簡單問題是我根本無法解答的例如, 是什麼使我們成癮為何要繼續這種無效的反毒手段呢?是否有更好的解套方式呢?為此我研究了大量的資料仍然找不出我要的答案所以我想說好吧, 我親自去走訪世界各地的人染過毒品的人或研究專家與他們交談並嘗試得到答案", "en": "And a few years ago, I was looking atsome of the addicts in my life who I love, and trying to figure outif there was some way to help them. And I realized there were loadsof incredibly basic questions I just didn't know the answer to, like, what really causes addiction? Why do we carry on with this approachthat doesn't seem to be working, and is there a better way out therethat we could try instead? So I read loads of stuff about it, and I couldn't really findthe answers I was looking for, so I thought, okay, I'll go and sitwith different people around the world who lived this and studied this and talk to them and seeif I could learn from them."}, {"zh-tw": "誰也沒想到一走就四萬八千公里以上面訪無數個不同的人從來自布魯克林的布朗斯維爾區販毒的跨性別者至餵食貓鼬吃幻覺劑的科學家研究牠們是否喜歡結果貓鼬真的喜歡但只限於某種情況下一直走訪到唯一把毒品合法化的國家從大麻至古柯鹼都合法的國家葡萄牙最讓我驚訝的一件事是我們對成癮的認知幾乎不對若我們開始吸收與成癮相關的新知我們要改變的事恐怕比現有的毒品政策還多", "en": "And I didn't realize I would end upgoing over 30,000 miles at the start, but I ended up going and meetingloads of different people, from a transgender crack dealerin Brownsville, Brooklyn, to a scientist who spends a lot of timefeeding hallucinogens to mongooses to see if they like them -- it turns out they do, but onlyin very specific circumstances -- to the only country that's everdecriminalized all drugs, from cannabis to crack, Portugal. And the thing I realizedthat really blew my mind is, almost everything we thinkwe know about addiction is wrong, and if we start to absorbthe new evidence about addiction, I think we're going to have to changea lot more than our drug policies."}, {"zh-tw": "但我們從我們所知道的開始吧想像一下中間這排的觀眾", "en": "But let's start with what we thinkwe know, what I thought I knew. Let's think about this middle row here."}, {"zh-tw": "想像從今天開始的二十天你們每天使用海洛因三次有些人看起來很興奮喔!(觀眾笑聲)", "en": "Imagine all of you, for 20 days now, wentoff and used heroin three times a day.

Imagine you did that, right? What would happen? Now, we have a story about what wouldhappen that we've been told for a century."}, {"zh-tw": "我們都知道因為海洛因裡化學物質的勾引當你使用了一段時間你的身體便開始依賴這些化學物質的勾引所以你自然就會需要它二十天後你們都染上海洛因了吧我那時候也是這樣想的我開始發現事情不太對勁讓我這麼解釋好了", "en": "We think, because there arechemical hooks in heroin, as you took it for a while, your body would becomedependent on those hooks, you'd start to physically need them, and at the end of those 20 days,you'd all be heroin addicts. Right? That's what I thought. First thing that alerted me to the factthat something's not right with this story is when it was explained to me."}, {"zh-tw": "如果我今天走出TED演講會場不幸遭遇車禍並斷了腿我即被送往醫院並且注射大量的二乙酰嗎啡二乙酰嗎啡就是海洛因", "en": "If I step out of this TED Talk todayand I get hit by a car and I break my hip, I'll be taken to hospitaland I'll be given loads of diamorphine. Diamorphine is heroin."}, {"zh-tw": "其純度比街上賣的海洛因更純因為毒販賣的貨是被汙染的事實上, 其海洛因的成份微乎其微因此醫生提供的藥品是純度最高的而且你會長期接受這種藥物治療", "en": "It's actually much better herointhan you're going to buy on the streets, because the stuff you buyfrom a drug dealer is contaminated. Actually, very little of it is heroin, whereas the stuff you getfrom the doctor is medically pure."}, {"zh-tw": "現場有非常多的人你們也許都沒發現你們已經用過大量的海洛因了而你們正在聽這場演講的同時這件事也正在發生", "en": "And you'll be given it for quitea long period of time. There are loads of people in this room, you may not realize it,you've taken quite a lot of heroin."}, {"zh-tw": "假設我們對成癮的認知是對的那些人也暴露在化學物質的勾引下吧結果會如何呢?他們應該也會變成癮君子我們仔細的研究過這個問題", "en": "And anyone who is watching thisanywhere in the world, this is happening. And if what we believeabout addiction is right -- those people are exposedto all those chemical hooks -- What should happen?They should become addicts."}, {"zh-tw": "結果是否定的若您的祖母做了髖關節置換手術她不會出院後就成了癮君子吧", "en": "This has been studied really carefully. It doesn't happen; you will have noticedif your grandmother had a hip replacement, she didn't come out as a junkie."}, {"zh-tw": "我了解之後一切似乎很怪異所有我所學的跟我所以為的其實都相反這整件事都怪怪的直到我見到布魯斯‧亞歷山大他是溫哥華的心理學教授他做過一次不可思議的實驗我真的認為這實驗幫助我了解此議題亞歷山大教授跟我解釋說", "en": "And when I learned this,it seemed so weird to me, so contrary to everything I'd been told,everything I thought I knew, I just thought it couldn't be right,until I met a man called Bruce Alexander. He's a professorof psychology in Vancouver who carried out an incredible experiment I think really helps usto understand this issue."}, {"zh-tw": "我們腦子裡所想的成癮這件事有部分原因來自於一系列的實驗結果於二十世紀早期所完成的實驗都是很簡單的實驗如果你有點虐待傾向今晚你可以在家實驗", "en": "Professor Alexander explained to me, the idea of addiction we've allgot in our heads, that story, comes partly from a series of experiments that were done earlierin the 20th century. They're really simple."}, {"zh-tw": "你把一隻老鼠放進籠子裡並放置兩瓶水在裡面一瓶是純水另一瓶水添加少許的海洛因或古柯鹼", "en": "You can do them tonight at homeif you feel a little sadistic. You get a rat and you put it in a cage,and you give it two water bottles: One is just water, and the other is waterlaced with either heroin or cocaine."}, {"zh-tw": "你會發現老鼠總是喜歡有毒的水總是死得特別快你看吧這就是我們知道的結果", "en": "If you do that, the rat will almost alwaysprefer the drug water and almost alwayskill itself quite quickly. So there you go, right?That's how we think it works."}, {"zh-tw": "在1970年代亞歷山大教授在過程中觀察此實驗然後他發現一個狀況他說我們把老鼠放在空籠子裡", "en": "In the '70s, Professor Alexander comesalong and he looks at this experiment and he noticed something. He said ah, we're puttingthe rat in an empty cage."}, {"zh-tw": "牠們無所事事當然只能吸毒我們嘗試不同的方法吧", "en": "It's got nothing to doexcept use these drugs. Let's try something different."}, {"zh-tw": "所以亞歷山大教授製作一個籠子叫做\"老鼠樂園\"基本上是老鼠玩樂的天堂牠們有大量的起司吃也有很多顏色的鼠球可玩還有無數條小隧道", "en": "So Professor Alexander built a cagethat he called \"Rat Park,\" which is basically heaven for rats. They've got loads of cheese,they've got loads of colored balls, they've got loads of tunnels."}, {"zh-tw": "最重要的是牠們有很多朋友可以一直交配然而我們同樣提供牠們自來水和毒水", "en": "Crucially, they've got loads of friends.They can have loads of sex. And they've got both the water bottles,the normal water and the drugged water."}, {"zh-tw": "令人訝異的是在老鼠樂園中牠們不喜歡喝毒水幾乎從不使用", "en": "But here's the fascinating thing: In Rat Park, they don'tlike the drug water. They almost never use it."}, {"zh-tw": "沒有一隻因為忍不住而飲用沒有一隻服藥過量", "en": "None of them ever use it compulsively. None of them ever overdose."}, {"zh-tw": "這數字從它們遭隔離而百分百引用毒水到它們擁有快樂和生命的聯繫後掉到零用量第一次看到這個情況亞歷山大教授認為也許這只是有關老鼠的事它們與我們不同", "en": "You go from almost 100 percent overdosewhen they're isolated to zero percent overdose when theyhave happy and connected lives. Now, when he first saw this,Professor Alexander thought, maybe this is just a thing about rats,they're quite different to us."}, {"zh-tw": "也許牠們不同於我們所愛來的多元但你知道的慶幸的是, 這有做過人體實驗發生在同個原則同個時間那就是越戰", "en": "Maybe not as different as we'd like,but, you know -- But fortunately, there wasa human experiment into the exact same principle happeningat the exact same time. It was called the Vietnam War."}, {"zh-tw": "在越南 有百分之二十的美軍使用大量的海洛因若你看那時候的新聞會發現大家都擔心得要命因為我們可能會有成千上萬的吸毒犯在美國的街上遊蕩當戰爭結束後證明了實驗的結果那些使用大量海洛因的軍人回鄉後", "en": "In Vietnam, 20 percent of all Americantroops were using loads of heroin, and if you look at the newsreports from the time, they were really worried, becausethey thought, my God, we're going to have hundreds of thousands of junkieson the streets of the United States when the war ends; it made total sense. Now, those soldiers who were usingloads of heroin were followed home."}, {"zh-tw": "普通精神病學文獻做了詳細的調查他們最後怎麼了呢?最後他們竟然沒有去戒毒所他們也沒有染上毒癮百分之九十五的人直接停止使用", "en": "The Archives of General Psychiatrydid a really detailed study, and what happened to them? It turns out they didn't go to rehab.They didn't go into withdrawal. Ninety-five percent of them just stopped."}, {"zh-tw": "現在您若相信有關化學掛勾的事您會覺得那根本是無稽之談但亞歷山大教授便開始去想或許成癮有另外的解讀他提到如果成癮跟化學掛勾也許無關呢?而是跟你所處的環境有關呢?或許上癮和嘗試適應你的環境有關？有了以上觀點另一位來自荷蘭的教授彼得‧寇恩他說也許我們根本不應該用\"成癮\"一詞", "en": "Now, if you believe the storyabout chemical hooks, that makes absolutely no sense,but Professor Alexander began to think there might be a differentstory about addiction. He said, what if addiction isn'tabout your chemical hooks? What if addiction is about your cage? What if addiction is an adaptationto your environment? Looking at this, there was another professorcalled Peter Cohen in the Netherlands who said, maybe we shouldn'teven call it addiction."}, {"zh-tw": "或許我們應該稱之為\"連結\"人類天生最原始的需求便是連結彼此而當我們開心又健康時我們會去連結彼此的關係但如果你無法這麼做的話是因為你心裡有創傷或受孤立或是遭生活壓力擊敗所致你需要跟某物做連結以幫助你舒緩壓力", "en": "Maybe we should call it bonding. Human beings have a naturaland innate need to bond, and when we're happy and healthy,we'll bond and connect with each other, but if you can't do that, because you're traumatized or isolatedor beaten down by life, you will bond with somethingthat will give you some sense of relief."}, {"zh-tw": "而這東西也許是賭博也許是色情書刊也許是古柯鹼也許是大麻煙但你會需要一個連結在因為這是我們人類的本性也是我們人類的基本需求", "en": "Now, that might be gambling,that might be pornography, that might be cocaine,that might be cannabis, but you will bond and connectwith something because that's our nature. That's what we want as human beings."}, {"zh-tw": "最初我覺得這件事難以理解但有個方法幫助我去思考我看到我座位旁有一罐水我看到你們很多人也有水忘掉毒品, 忘掉反毒戰爭", "en": "And at first, I found this quitea difficult thing to get my head around, but one way that helped meto think about it is, I can see, I've got over by my seata bottle of water, right? I'm looking at lots of you, and lotsof you have bottles of water with you. Forget the drugs. Forget the drug war."}, {"zh-tw": "在完全合法情況下這些水可能都是伏特加吧?我們可能都會醉倒在一起或許演講之後我會 －但我們沒醉呀因為你們都有接近海量的酒量這是參加TED演講的成果我猜你們都可以承受未來六個月每天喝伏特加", "en": "Totally legally, all of those bottlesof water could be bottles of vodka, right? We could all be getting drunk --I might after this --  -- but we're not. Now, because you've been able to affordthe approximately gazillion pounds that it costs to get into a TED Talk,I'm guessing you guys could afford to be drinking vodkafor the next six months."}, {"zh-tw": "而你最後卻不會成為遊民你不會這麼做的原因是不是因為有人阻止你", "en": "You wouldn't end up homeless. You're not going to do that,and the reason you're not going to do that is not because anyone's stopping you."}, {"zh-tw": "而是因為你有很多的連結在這些連結是你希望能參與的你有你愛的工作你有你愛的人", "en": "It's because you've gotbonds and connections that you want to be present for. You've got work you love.You've got people you love."}, {"zh-tw": "你有健康的關係然而成癮最核心的關鍵我了解後,相信證據所建議的方式是有關你無法忍受在生活中扮演的角色", "en": "You've got healthy relationships. And a core part of addiction, I came to think, and I believethe evidence suggests, is about not being able to bearto be present in your life."}, {"zh-tw": "這件事有個顯著的涵義在最顯著的例子是在\"反毒之戰\"裡", "en": "Now, this has reallysignificant implications. The most obvious implicationsare for the War on Drugs."}, {"zh-tw": "在亞利桑那州, 我跟一群婦女出去她們受迫穿上\"我是吸毒犯\"的衣服用鍊子栓成串的囚犯挖墳墓人們看到都嘲笑她們當那些婦女出獄後她們便留下了犯罪紀錄代表她們永遠無法在合法的經濟體制工作顯然這個鍊子栓成串的囚犯的例子太過極端了但事實上世界各地都有類似的情形我們對待染毒者的方式也差不多", "en": "In Arizona, I went outwith a group of women who were made to wear t-shirtssaying, \"I was a drug addict,\" and go out on chain gangs and dig graveswhile members of the public jeer at them, and when those women get out of prison,they're going to have criminal records that mean they'll never workin the legal economy again. Now, that's a very extreme example,obviously, in the case of the chain gang, but actually almosteverywhere in the world we treat addicts to some degree like that."}, {"zh-tw": "我們懲罰她們, 讓他們羞愧也留下犯罪紀錄我們阻止她們擁有再次連結的機會", "en": "We punish them. We shame them.We give them criminal records. We put barriers between them reconnecting."}, {"zh-tw": "加拿大有位醫生叫嘉柏‧馬鐵他非常傑出他告訴我若你想設計一個使上癮問題更糟的系統這就是那個系統現在有一個地方決定去執行相反的模式而我觀察了它們的運作方法", "en": "There was a doctor in Canada,Dr. Gabor Maté, an amazing man, who said to me, if you wanted to designa system that would make addiction worse, you would design that system. Now, there's a place that decidedto do the exact opposite, and I went there to see how it worked."}, {"zh-tw": "西元兩千年的時候葡萄牙是歐洲毒品最氾濫的國家百分之一的人口都有吸食海洛因真的無法想像每年他們都大量效法美國的方式", "en": "In the year 2000, Portugal hadone of the worst drug problems in Europe.

And they set up a panel led byan amazing man called Dr. João Goulão, to look at all this new evidence, and they came back and they said, \"Decriminalize all drugsfrom cannabis to crack, but\" -- and this is the crucial next step -- \"take all the money we used to spendon cutting addicts off, on disconnecting them, and spend it insteadon reconnecting them with society.\" And that's not really what we think ofas drug treatment in the United States and Britain."}, {"zh-tw": "他們的確也有戒毒中心也做心理治療多少都有些價值在然而跟我們的作法完全不同在於他們提供染毒者大量不同的職缺提供微型貸款給他們創業", "en": "So they do do residential rehab, they do psychological therapy,that does have some value.
