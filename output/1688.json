Being gay and fathering triplets is by far the most socially innovative,socially entrepreneurial thing I have ever done."}, {"zh-tw": "我真正要談的公益創新是關於慈善我想講的是我們從小怎樣被灌輸對於幫助別人﹐慈善和非牟利團體的看法其實它們潛意識破壞我們所愛護的以及我們潛在去改變世界的渴望", "en": "The real social innovation I wantto talk about involves charity. I want to talk about how the thingswe've been taught to think about giving and about charity and about the nonprofit sector, are actually underminingthe causes we love, and our profound yearningto change the world."}, {"zh-tw": "我說這個以前﹐我想問一下我們其實相不相信非牟利組織擔任著改變世界的重要角色很多人說既然一般的企業幫助促進發展中的經濟體那麼就由社會型企業來負責餘下的那部分", "en": "But before I do that,I want to ask if we even believe that the nonprofit sectorhas any serious role to play in changing the world. A lot of people say now that businesswill lift up the developing economies, and social businesswill take care of the rest."}, {"zh-tw": "我相信企業會帶動很大部份的人性前進但同時, 它亦會放棄10%或以上的那些最不幸﹐最弱勢的人群", "en": "And I do believe that business will movethe great mass of humanity forward.

Why have our breast cancercharities not come close to finding a cure for breast cancer, or our homeless charities not come close to ending homelessness in any major city?

They might be smart. It's cheaper for that person to donate 100,000 dollars every yearto the hunger charity; save 50,000 dollars on their taxes -- so still be roughly 270,000 dollarsa year ahead of the game -- now be called a philanthropistbecause they donated 100,000 dollars to charity; probably sit on the boardof the hunger charity; indeed, probably supervise the poor SOB who decided to become the CEOof the hunger charity; and have a lifetimeof this kind of power and influence and popular praise still ahead of them."}, {"zh-tw": "第二方面的歧視來自宣傳跟廣告我們告訴牟利機構，\"花，花，把錢都花在廣告上直到榨乾最後一滴價值\"但我們偏不喜歡看到我們的捐款被花在為慈善做廣告上", "en": "The second area of discriminationis advertising and marketing. So we tell the for-profit sector,\"Spend, spend, spend on advertising, until the last dollar no longerproduces a penny of value.\" But we don't like to see our donationsspent on advertising in charity."}, {"zh-tw": "我們的態度是，\"聽著，如是你真的要做那件事情你在清晨四點鐘做，我沒意見。但我真的不想看到我的捐款用在廣告上我是想它用在有需要的人身上啊。\"誰說投資在廣告上就不能帶來巨大的收益去幫助有需要的人", "en": "Our attitude is, \"Well, look,if you can get the advertising donated, you know, to air at four o'clockin the morning, I'm okay with that.

They raised more moneymore quickly for these causes than any events in history, all based on the ideathat people are weary of being asked to do the leastthey can possibly do."}, {"zh-tw": "人們渴望瞭解自己在所關注的事業上在所關注的事業上盡力得到的結果。但得有人邀請他們", "en": "People are yearning to measurethe full distance of their potential on behalf of the causesthat they care about deeply. But they have to be asked."}, {"zh-tw": "我們之所以有那麼多參賽者全靠放在紐約時代雜誌波士頓環球報的整版廣告，還有電台，電視黃金時段的廣告你知道如果我們把宣傳放在自助洗衣店門口會有多少人參加嗎?慈善捐助在美國一直停滯不前從1970年至今一直維持在國内生產總值的2%", "en": "We got that many people to participate by buying full-page adsin The New York Times, in The Boston Globe, in prime timeradio and TV advertising. Do you know how many peoplewe would've gotten if we put up fliers in the laundromat? Charitable giving has remained stuckin the U.S., at two percent of GDP, ever since we startedmeasuring it in the 1970s."}, {"zh-tw": "這個告訴我們很重要的一個事情就是四十年來，非牟利行業到現在還有從牟利行業那處爭得一點點市場試想一下一個連市場行銷都不被允許的行業又如何能夠從另一個行業那裡拿走市場?我們會告訴消費品品牌\"你該宣傳產品所有的好處\"但那邊，我們告訴慈善機構，\"你不能夠宣傳你做過什麼好事\"那你認為消費者的鈔票會落入哪一邊?第三樣歧視是為提高收益而創新所承受的風險", "en": "That's an important fact,because it tells us that in 40 years, the nonprofit sector has not been ableto wrestle any market share away from the for-profit sector. And if you think about it,how could one sector possibly take market shareaway from another sector if it isn't really allowed to market? And if we tell the consumer brands, \"You may advertiseall the benefits of your product,\" but we tell charities, \"You cannotadvertise all the good that you do,\" where do we think the consumerdollars are going to flow? The third area of discriminationis the taking of risk in pursuit of new ideasfor generating revenue."}, {"zh-tw": "迪士尼可以虧掉一部二億元的電影沒有人會起訴它但要是你為了貧困籌了區區一百萬的款項而在頭一年沒有達到75%的盈餘你的聲譽就會遭到質疑", "en": "So Disney can make a new$200 million movie that flops, and nobody calls the attorney general. But you do a little $1 millioncommunity fundraiser for the poor, and it doesn't produce a 75 percent profitto the cause in the first 12 months, and your characteris called into question."}, {"zh-tw": "所以非牟利機構其實真的對大膽的，銳意進取的大型的籌款活動卻步怕的是一旦失敗它們便會聲名狼藉你該知道禁止失敗我們便會泄氣。", "en": "So nonprofits are really reluctantto attempt any brave, daring, giant-scalenew fundraising endeavors, for fear that if the thing fails, their reputations will be draggedthrough the mud. Well, you and I know when you prohibit failure,you kill innovation."}, {"zh-tw": "要是在籌款活動上沒有創新，就不會有任何收入提高要是沒有收入，你便不會發展不能夠發展，你便不能夠解決龐大的社會問題第四點是時間。", "en": "If you kill innovation in fundraising,you can't raise more revenue; if you can't raise more revenue,you can't grow; and if you can't grow, you can'tpossibly solve large social problems. The fourth area is time."}, {"zh-tw": "亞馬遜網站連續六年沒有發盈利給投資者人們都還有耐性他們知道這是一個在市場中獨佔鰲頭的長線項目", "en": "So Amazon went for six yearswithout returning any profit to investors, and people had patience. They knew that there was a long-termobjective down the line, of building market dominance."}, {"zh-tw": "但要是公益機構夢想要花六年創做一個龐大項目而這些錢都不會被用在有需要的人上全部金錢都用在投資在項目上它一定不會有好日子過最後是盈餘", "en": "But if a nonprofit organizationever had a dream of building magnificent scalethat required that for six years, no money was going to go to the needy, it was all going to be investedin building this scale, we would expect a crucifixion. The last area is profit itself."}, {"zh-tw": "牟利商業可以靠分紅來吸引人們來投資它們的新概念但非牟利機構不可以，牟利能夠獨霸市場但非牟利機構得不到成長跟機會以及理想的資本你用五根指頭算算，你未能把能幹的人從牟利機構中挖過來你不能夠像牟利機構般宣傳，賣廣告去吸引新客戶你沒有牟利機構的能力承受追求那些客戶的風險你沒有像牟利機構那樣多的時間去找那些客戶你沒有股票市場去支助你所有這些行為就算你一開始能這麼做相較於牟利企業非牟利機構已經在非牟利機構已經在每個層面上", "en": "So the for-profit sectorcan pay people profits in order to attract their capitalfor their new ideas, but you can't pay profitsin a nonprofit sector, so the for-profit sector has a lock on the multi-trillion-dollarcapital markets, and the nonprofit sector is starvedfor growth and risk and idea capital. Well, you put thosefive things together -- you can't use money to lure talentaway from the for-profit sector; you can't advertiseon anywhere near the scale the for-profit sectordoes for new customers; you can't take the kinds of risksin pursuit of those customers that the for-profit sector takes; you don't have the same amount of timeto find them as the for-profit sector; and you don't have a stock marketwith which to fund any of this, even if you could do itin the first place -- and you've just put the nonprofit sector at an extreme disadvantageto the for-profit sector, on every level."}, {"zh-tw": "都處於極端的劣勢要是你對這雙種標準的效果有所質疑這些統計數字能叫你醒悟過來從1970年 到2009年真正超越了五百萬年收入大關的非牟利機構有144個如此同時，能夠跨過那收入關卡的牟利機構有46,136個", "en": "If we have any doubts about the effectsof this separate rule book, this statistic is sobering: From 1970 to 2009, the number of nonprofits that really grew, that crossed the $50 millionannual revenue barrier, is 144.

All of the scale goesto Coca-Cola and Burger King."}, {"zh-tw": "我們為何會這樣想?美國的這些狂熱信條來源于從前的清教徒的教義清教徒們，或者按他們自己的說法，來這裡出於宗教理由但他們也是為了賺大錢", "en": "So why do we think this way? Well, like most fanaticaldogma in America, these ideas come from old Puritan beliefs. The Puritans came herefor religious reasons, or so they said, but they also came here becausethey wanted to make a lot of money."}, {"zh-tw": "他們是虔誠的教徒也是激進的資本家比起其他殖民者他們被指責使用極端手段來牟利但同時﹐清教徒也是加爾文主義者所以他們被教導要怨恨自己", "en": "They were pious people, but they were alsoreally aggressive capitalists, and they were accused of extreme formsof profit-making tendencies, compared to the other colonists.

This created a real problemfor these people."}, {"zh-tw": "他們不辭萬里越洋來賺錢但賺這些錢又會把你直接推向地獄他們該怎樣做?慈善公益就是他們的答案", "en": "Here they've come all the way acrossthe Atlantic to make all this money, but making all this moneywill get you sent directly to Hell. What were they to do about this? Well, charity became their answer."}, {"zh-tw": "這是他們經濟的避難所他們可以繼續每一塊錢裡的五分錢懺悔理所當然地﹐要是慈善是你為牟利而懺悔那你怎樣能夠以它來賺錢?在幫助別人的國度裡﹐經濟獎勵是不容許的因為那會促使你去為自己賺錢﹐四百年來﹐從來沒有聲音介入說\"這只會適得其反﹐這是不公平的\"現在總有一個非常危險的問題縈繞著這種觀念\"我的捐款有多少是落到慈善事業?有多少落入慈善機構的營運開銷?\"這問題漏洞百出", "en": "It became this economic sanctuary, where they could do penancefor their profit-making tendencies -- at five cents on the dollar. So of course, how could youmake money in charity if charity was your penancefor making money? Financial incentive was exiledfrom the realm of helping others, so that it could thrive in the areaof making money for yourself, and in 400 years, nothing has intervened to say, \"That's counterproductiveand that's unfair.\" Now, this ideology gets policedby this one very dangerous question, which is, \"What percentage of my donationgoes to the cause versus overhead?\" There are a lot of problemswith this question."}, {"zh-tw": "我只說兩個第一﹐ 我們認為開銷是無意義的它並不屬於慈善事業", "en": "I'm going to just focus on two. First, it makes us thinkthat overhead is a negative, that it is somehow not part of the cause."}, {"zh-tw": "但它絕對是﹐ 特別是假如它們被用於機構發展日常開銷在某種程度上是慈善事業的大敵由此衍生了第二個更大的問題它逼迫這些機構拋開它們確實需要用以發展的營運開銷來運作為的只是將此開銷控制在低水準", "en": "But it absolutely is, especiallyif it's being used for growth. Now, this idea that overheadis somehow an enemy of the cause creates this second, much larger problem, which is, it forces organizationsto go without the overhead things they really need to grow, in the interest of keeping overhead low."}, {"zh-tw": "我們提倡的是﹐慈善團體應該盡可能得在像籌款這些活動上削減開支在這種觀念下﹐你在籌款上花費越少便會有更多的錢花在慈善上假如在一個我們無法把事業做大的蕭條社會那確是真的", "en": "So we've all been taughtthat charities should spend as little as possible on overheadthings like fundraising under the theory that, well, the lessmoney you spend on fundraising, the more money there isavailable for the cause. Well, that's trueif it's a depressing world in which this pie cannotbe made any bigger."}, {"zh-tw": "但如果是在一個正常社會,越多捐款便會有更多資金讓這餅變大我們就是在背道而馳我們該投資更多錢在籌款上而不是更少因為籌款更有可能大量積聚財富用我們真的關心的事情上我給你們兩個例子", "en": "But if it's a logical worldin which investment in fundraising actually raises more fundsand makes the pie bigger, then we have it precisely backwards, and we should be investing more money,not less, in fundraising, because fundraising is the one thing that has the potentialto multiply the amount of money available for the causethat we care about so deeply.
