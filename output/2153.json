Now, I think that we can all agree that mathematiciansare famously excellent at finding love. But it's not just becauseof our dashing personalities, superior conversational skillsand excellent pencil cases."}, {"zh-tw": "也是因為我們真的花了許多時間精力在數學上，計算如何找到完美的伴侶。現在，在此學科中我最愛的論文，名為「為甚麼我沒有女友」Peter Backus 試著計算他尋得真愛的機會。", "en": "It's also because we've actually donean awful lot of work into the maths of how to find the perfect partner. Now, in my favorite paperon the subject, which is entitled, \"Why I Don't Have a Girlfriend\" -- Peter Backus tries to ratehis chances of finding love."}, {"zh-tw": "現在，Peter 不是一個非常貪心的人。在英國所有適宜的女性對象中，Peter 所看的，就只是那個住在他附近的對象、某個處於適宜的年齡階段的女人、某個擁有大學文憑、某個他很有可能相處地不錯的對象、某個有魅力的女子，以及......某個認為他也富有魅力的對象。", "en": "Now, Peter's not a very greedy man. Of all of the available women in the UK, all Peter's looking foris somebody who lives near him, somebody in the right age range, somebody with a university degree, somebody he's likely to get on well with, somebody who's likely to be attractive, somebody who's likelyto find him attractive."}, {"zh-tw": "結果他估計在全英國大概有 26 位此類女性。這看來很不妙，不是嗎，Peter？我們好好思考一下這件事，在無數聰明外星生命形式存在的情況下，那是少於 400 倍數的估計呀。", "en": "And comes up with an estimateof 26 women in the whole of the UK. It's not looking very good, is it Peter? Now, just to put that into perspective, that's about 400 times fewerthan the best estimates of how many intelligentextraterrestrial life forms there are."}, {"zh-tw": "那也給了 Peter 一個在某晚遇見一個特別的女子28 萬 5 千之 1 的機會。我想，那就是為什麼數學家不再怎麼想晚上出去約會了的原因了吧。", "en": "And it also gives Petera 1 in 285,000 chance of bumping into any oneof these special ladies on a given night out. I'd like to thinkthat's why mathematicians don't really bothergoing on nights out anymore."}, {"zh-tw": "重點是，我個人其實並不同意這種悲觀的看法，因為我知道，如同你們所有所知道的，愛情並不是這樣發生的。", "en": "The thing is that I personallydon't subscribe to such a pessimistic view. Because I know,just as well as all of you do, that love doesn't really work like that."}, {"zh-tw": "人類的情感不是那樣地秩序井然、乾淨利落、邏輯清晰，和容易預測。但我也知道那並不意謂著數學無法提供幫助，因為愛情，如同生命中多數的事物一般，充斥著許多規律，而數學最終就是那研究規律的學說。", "en": "Human emotion isn't neatly orderedand rational and easily predictable. But I also know that that doesn't mean that mathematics hasn't got somethingthat it can offer us, because, love, as with most of life,is full of patterns and mathematics is, ultimately,all about the study of patterns."}, {"zh-tw": "從預測天候，到預測股票市場的開高走低，到星球的運轉，或都市的發展。如果我們對自己誠實的話，上述那些東西，沒有一個是井然有序以及容易預測的。", "en": "Patterns from predicting the weatherto the fluctuations in the stock market, to the movement of the planetsor the growth of cities. And if we're being honest,none of those things are exactly neatly orderedand easily predictable, either."}, {"zh-tw": "因為我相信，數學的力量非常強大，以至於它讓我們得以以新方法重新看待任何事物。就算是和愛情一般神秘的東西也是。", "en": "Because I believe that mathematicsis so powerful that it has the potential to offer us a new way of lookingat almost anything. Even something as mysterious as love."}, {"zh-tw": "為了試著說服你們數學的神妙用處，我想要給大家三個最重要的在數學上可以驗證的愛情秘訣。好，首先最重要的秘技一：如何贏得線上交友的機會。", "en": "And so, to try to persuade you of how totally amazing, excellentand relevant mathematics is, I want to give you my top threemathematically verifiable tips for love. OK, so Top Tip #1: How to win at online dating."}, {"zh-tw": "我最愛的線上交友網站是 OkCupid（網站名：好吧，丘比特），這並不僅僅因為這網站是由一群數學家所架設的。因為他們是數學家，他們已經蒐集了近乎這十年來所有該網站使用者的資料。", "en": "So my favorite online datingwebsite is OkCupid, not least because it was startedby a group of mathematicians. Now, because they're mathematicians, they have been collecting data on everybody who uses their sitefor almost a decade."}, {"zh-tw": "他們試著尋找我們在線上談論自己的方式的模式，以及我們和他人互動的模式。他們發現了一些重要的有趣結果。", "en": "And they've been tryingto search for patterns in the way that we talk about ourselves and the way that we interactwith each other on an online dating website. And they've come up with someseriously interesting findings."}, {"zh-tw": "但我特別喜歡的結果之一是在線上交友網站上你的魅力程度並無法預測你的受歡迎程度，事實上，讓人們覺得你很醜可以讓你擁有優勢。讓我向各位展示這是怎麼一回事。", "en": "But my particular favorite is that it turns outthat on an online dating website, how attractive you aredoes not dictate how popular you are, and actually, having peoplethink that you're ugly can work to your advantage. Let me show you how this works."}, {"zh-tw": "在 OkCupid 的一個自願欄目中，你可以評價人們的魅力值，從 1 到 5 。現在，如果我們比較這個分數，平均分數，有多少人收到訊息，你就可以開始理解在一個線上約會網站上魅力指數與受歡迎程度有關。", "en": "In a thankfully voluntarysection of OkCupid, you are allowed to ratehow attractive you think people are on a scale between one and five. Now, if we compare this score,the average score, to how many messagesa selection of people receive, you can begin to get a sense of how attractiveness links to popularityon an online dating website."}, {"zh-tw": "這是 OkCupid 得到的圖表。一件重要的值得注意的事是並不是越有魅力的人，收到的訊息越多。", "en": "This is the graph the OkCupid guyshave come up with. And the important thing to noticeis that it's not totally true that the more attractive you are,the more messages you get."}, {"zh-tw": "問題是，為什麼上面的這些人比下面這些人要受歡迎得多，即便他們都有相同的魅力值？原因是，並不是直觀的外貌是重要的。讓我來談談他們的發現，以一個案例說明。", "en": "But the question arises thenof what is it about people up here who are so much more popularthan people down here, even though they have the samescore of attractiveness? And the reason why is that it's not juststraightforward looks that are important. So let me try to illustratetheir findings with an example."}, {"zh-tw": "如果你拿 Portia de Rossi 為例，每個人都同意 Portia de Rossi 是個非常美麗的女人，沒有人覺得她醜，但她也不是超級名模。", "en": "So if you take someone likePortia de Rossi, for example, everybody agrees that Portia de Rossiis a very beautiful woman. Nobody thinks that she's ugly,but she's not a supermodel, either."}, {"zh-tw": "如果你拿某個人，比如Sarah Jessica Parker（譯注：慾望城市女主角）來和她比較許多人，包括我自己，我應該會說，Sarah Jessica Parker 魅力極為出眾，有可能是地表上最美麗的物種之一。但許多其他人，比如，大多數的網友", "en": "If you compare Portia de Rossito someone like Sarah Jessica Parker, now, a lot of people,myself included, I should say, think that Sarah Jessica Parkeris seriously fabulous and possibly oneof the most beautiful creatures to have ever have walkedon the face of the Earth. But some other people,i.e., most of the Internet ..."}, {"zh-tw": "似乎都認為她看起來像馬。如果你問人們他們覺得自己有多美，Sarah Jessica Parker 或 Portia de Rossi你要他們給自己打分，從 1 到 5，我猜他們也會大約給一個和大家都差不多的數字。", "en": "seem to think that she looksa bit like a horse. Now, I think that if you ask peoplehow attractive they thought Jessica Parker or Portia de Rossi were, and you ask them to givethem a score between one and five I reckon that they'd average outto have roughly the same score."}, {"zh-tw": "但是人們投票的方式各自不同。因此 Portia 的分數會聚集在 4 分左右，因為所有人都同意，她非常美麗，然而人們對 Sarah Jessica Parker卻有截然不同的意見。", "en": "But the way that people would votewould be very different. So Portia's scores wouldall be clustered around the four because everybody agreesthat she's very beautiful, whereas Sarah Jessica Parkercompletely divides opinion."}, {"zh-tw": "她的分差懸殊很大。然而事實上，就是那分差別具意義，", "en": "There'd be a huge spread in her scores. And actually it's this spread that counts."}, {"zh-tw": "那差異讓你在交友網站上受歡迎。所以那意味著如果有些人認為你別具魅力，你最好有其他人認為你很醜。", "en": "It's this spreadthat makes you more popular on an online Internet dating website. So what that means then is that if some peoplethink that you're attractive, you're actually better off having some other peoplethink that you're a massive minger."}, {"zh-tw": "那遠優於所有人認為你是鄰家的可愛女孩。當你們開始思考一下這些寄送訊息的人的話，這開始變得合理些了。", "en": "That's much betterthan everybody just thinking that you're the cute girl next door. Now, I think this beginsto make a bit more sense when you think in terms of the peoplewho are sending these messages."}, {"zh-tw": "這麼說吧，假設你認為那個人很美，但你同時猜想其他人並不會和你有同樣的審美觀。那就意味著，你的競爭對手略少，這就給你增加了額外的動機去與他/她認識。", "en": "So let's say that you thinksomebody's attractive, but you suspect that other peoplewon't necessarily be that interested. That means there'sless competition for you and it's an extra incentivefor you to get in touch."}, {"zh-tw": "與之相對的情況是，你認為某人很有吸引力，但你猜想所有其他的人都認為那人很有吸引力，嗯，讓我們面對事實為什麼要自取其辱呢？這就是最有趣的部分。", "en": "Whereas compare thatto if you think somebody is attractive but you suspect that everybodyis going to think they're attractive. Well, why would you botherhumiliating yourself, let's be honest? But here's where the reallyinteresting part comes."}, {"zh-tw": "因為當人們去選擇他們在交友網站上使用的照片時，他們總是試圖最小化其他人認為不吸引人之處的可能性。最經典的例子是，那些體重略重的人故意選擇一個剪裁非常不正確的照片，例如那些禿頭的男士，故意去選擇他們帶著帽子的照片。", "en": "Because when people choose the picturesthat they use on an online dating website, they often try to minimize the things that they think some peoplewill find unattractive. The classic example is peoplewho are, perhaps, a little bit overweight deliberately choosinga very cropped photo, or bald men, for example, deliberately choosing pictureswhere they're wearing hats."}, {"zh-tw": "但你的行為是與你的目標相悖的，如果你想要在網上交友成功。你真的應該，去選擇讓你看起來與眾不同的照片，即便你認為某些人會對此失去興趣。", "en": "But actually this is the oppositeof what you should do if you want to be successful. You should really, instead, play up to whatever it isthat makes you different, even if you think that some peoplewill find it unattractive."}, {"zh-tw": "因為那些喜歡你的人無論如何都會去喜歡你，而那些不重要的路人只是渲染你的優勢。好了，最高秘訣 2 號：如何選擇完美的伴侶。", "en": "Because the people who fancy youare just going to fancy you anyway, and the unimportant losers who don't,well, they only play up to your advantage. OK, Top Tip #2:How to pick the perfect partner."}, {"zh-tw": "讓我們想像你的約會精彩成功，但問題來了你如何將那成功的約會轉變成長期的幸福，尤其是，你要如何選擇在哪個時刻安定下來？一般來說，並不建議人們立刻與第一個出現對你表達好感的人結婚。", "en": "So let's imagine thenthat you're a roaring success on the dating scene. But the question arisesof how do you then convert that success into longer-term happiness, and in particular, how do you decidewhen is the right time to settle down? Now generally,it's not advisable to just cash in and marry the first person who comes alongand shows you any interest at all."}, {"zh-tw": "但是，一般來說，如果你想要最大化你未來數十年幸福婚姻的機會，你也不願等待太久。我最喜歡的作家珍．奧斯汀這樣說：「一個未婚的 27 歲女子就別指望再能感受或觸動愛情了。」", "en": "But, equally, you don't reallywant to leave it too long if you want to maximize your chanceof long-term happiness. As my favorite author,Jane Austen, puts it, \"An unmarried woman of seven and twenty can never hope to feelor inspire affection again.\" Thanks a lot, Jane."}, {"zh-tw": "這太嚴重了，珍，你對愛瞭解多少呢？那麼問題來了，你怎麼知道哪個時刻是該要安定下來的時刻，畢竟生命中你有很多可能的對象？幸好，我們可以運用一點數學來幫助我們計算解決這個問題，這理論名叫 「最優停止理論」。那麼讓我們來想像一下，你在 15 歲的時候開始交往，理想狀態下，你在 35 歲的時候會結婚。", "en": "What do you know about love? So the question is then, how do you know whenis the right time to settle down, given all the peoplethat you can date in your lifetime? Thankfully, there's a rather delicious bitof mathematics that we can use to help us out here,called optimal stopping theory. So let's imagine, then, that you start dating when you're 15 and ideally, you'd like to be marriedby the time that you're 35."}, {"zh-tw": "你的人生中有很多潛在的約會對象，他們都有各自的優點。規則是，你一旦跳進婚姻，你就不能繼續前進尋找你可能可以有的對象，你也不能回頭來改變你的主意。", "en": "And there's a number of people that you could potentiallydate across your lifetime, and they'll be at varyinglevels of goodness. Now the rules are that onceyou cash in and get married, you can't look ahead to seewhat you could have had, and equally, you can't go backand change your mind."}, {"zh-tw": "我個人的經驗看來，一般人們不希望在被拒絕又過了多年後被找回來，也許只有我這樣想。數學告訴我們你應該拒絕認為會和在你人生約會週期前 37% 時段出現的任何人有嚴肅認真的婚姻關係。", "en": "In my experience at least, I find that typically peopledon't much like being recalled years after being passed upfor somebody else, or that's just me. So the math says thenthat what you should do in the first 37 percentof your dating window, you should just reject everybodyas serious marriage potential."}, {"zh-tw": "接著，你要選擇下一個人，那個比你以前約會對象都好的人。這裡舉個例子。", "en": "And then, you should pickthe next person that comes along that is better than everybodythat you've seen before. So here's the example."}, {"zh-tw": "如果你這麼做，從數學證明來看可以認為，事實上這可能是最好的選擇來最大化你找到完美伴侶的機會。現在不幸的是，我必須告訴你這個方法也是有風險的。", "en": "Now if you do this, it can bemathematically proven, in fact, that this is the best possible way of maximizing your chancesof finding the perfect partner. Now unfortunately, I have to tell you thatthis method does come with some risks."}, {"zh-tw": "比如，想像一下，假設你的完美伴侶出現在你約會歷程的前 37%那就很不幸了，你會拒絕他們。", "en": "For instance, imagineif your perfect partner appeared during your first 37 percent. Now, unfortunately,you'd have to reject them."}, {"zh-tw": "如果你相信數學，恐怕你不會再找到比你以往見過更好的對象，你就會持續拒絕每個人然後孤獨終老。可能會被貓咪包圍一點點啃食你的遺骸。", "en": "Now, if you're following the maths, I'm afraid no one else comes along that's better than anyoneyou've seen before, so you have to go onrejecting everyone and die alone. Probably surrounded by cats ..."}, {"zh-tw": "好，另一個風險是，讓我們想像，相反的，你約會歷程前 37% 裡第一個對象極度愚蠢、無聊又很糟糕。", "en": "nibbling at your remains. OK, another risk is,let's imagine, instead, that the first people that you datedin your first 37 percent are just incredibly dull,boring, terrible people."}, {"zh-tw": "沒關係，因為你還處於拒絕對象的階段，沒問題，你可以拒絕他們。但想像一下，下一個出現的人只是沒那麼無聊、愚蠢，", "en": "That's OK, becauseyou're in your rejection phase, so that's fine, you can reject them. But then imaginethe next person to come along is just marginally less boring,dull and terrible ..."}, {"zh-tw": "比你以前的對象都略好那麼一點。如果你遵循數學，恐怕你要和他們結婚", "en": "than everybody that you've seen before. Now, if you are following the maths,I'm afraid you have to marry them ..."}, {"zh-tw": "然後沈浸在一段，實話說，次優的關係中。很抱歉。", "en": "and end up in a relationshipwhich is, frankly, suboptimal. Sorry about that."}, {"zh-tw": "但我認為，機會還是有的賀曼公司迎合市場需求出售這樣的情人節賀卡。", "en": "But I do think that there's an opportunityhere for Hallmark to cash in on and really cater for this market. A Valentine's Day card like this."}, {"zh-tw": "「我親愛的丈夫，你沒有我約會歷程中前 37% 的男士那麼糟糕。」這比一般的賀卡浪漫很多。這個數學方法不能保證100% 的成功率，但也沒有更好的策略了。", "en": "\"My darling husband,you are marginally less terrible than the first 37 percentof people I dated.\" It's actually more romanticthan I normally manage. OK, so this method doesn't give youa 100 percent success rate, but there's no other possiblestrategy that can do any better."}, {"zh-tw": "事實上，在動物界，某個特定種類的魚遵循使用這樣的策略。在交配期，牠們拒絕出現在前 37% 的每個求婚者，接著牠們選擇 37% 後出現的下一個比所見過的魚體型更加龐大，更加結實的魚。", "en": "And actually, in the wild,there are certain types of fish which follow and employthis exact strategy. So they reject every possiblesuitor that turns up in the first 37 percentof the mating season, and then they pick the next fishthat comes along after that window that's, I don't know, bigger and burlier than all of the fishthat they've seen before."}, {"zh-tw": "我想作為人類我們潛意識裡也在做同樣的選擇。我們給自己更多時間尋找，在我們年輕的時候感受婚戀市場。", "en": "I also think that subconsciously,humans, we do sort of do this anyway. We give ourselves a little bit of timeto play the field, get a feel for the marketplaceor whatever when we're young."}, {"zh-tw": "我們只有在 20 歲年齡段的中後期才會很真尋找潛在的結婚對象。我想這證明了，即使不確定是否需要，每個人的大腦都預配了點數學能力。", "en": "And then we only start looking seriouslyat potential marriage candidates once we hit our mid-to-late 20s. I think this is conclusive proof,if ever it were needed, that everybody's brains are prewiredto be just a little bit mathematical."}, {"zh-tw": "好，上述就是最高秘訣 2 號。現在，最高秘訣 3 號：如何避免離婚。", "en": "OK, so that was Top Tip #2. Now, Top Tip #3: How to avoid divorce."}, {"zh-tw": "好的，讓我們想像一下你找到了你的完美對象，你和他/她進入了一生的婚姻關係。我假設每個人都不希望離婚，當然，也許除了 Piers Morgan 的太太？可是，現代婚姻一個悲傷的事實就是美國離婚率高達 50%，世界其他國家也離這個數據不遠。", "en": "OK, so let's imagine thenthat you picked your perfect partner and you're settling intoa lifelong relationship with them. Now, I like to think that everybodywould ideally like to avoid divorce, apart from, I don't know,Piers Morgan's wife, maybe? But it's a sad fact of modern life that one in two marriagesin the States ends in divorce, with the rest of the worldnot being far behind."}, {"zh-tw": "當然，你可以認為婚姻破裂的原因不是數學運算理想的數據源。一方面來說，很難瞭解到你該去測量什麼或者是你該去量化什麼。", "en": "Now, you can be forgiven, perhaps for thinking that the argumentsthat precede a marital breakup are not an ideal candidatefor mathematical investigation. For one thing, it's very hard to know what you should be measuringor what you should be quantifying."}, {"zh-tw": "但這並沒有阻止心理學家John Gottman 做這樣的研究。Gottman 觀察了數百對夫婦的對談盡可能錄下來所有資訊。", "en": "But this didn't stop a psychologist,John Gottman, who did exactly that. Gottman observed hundreds of coupleshaving a conversation and recorded, well,everything you can think of."}, {"zh-tw": "記錄了對話的內容、皮膚的傳導性、面部表情、心跳、血壓，基本上除了「太太永遠是對的」以外的所有東西，當然，太太永遠是對的。但是，Gottman 和他的團隊發現最能夠準確預測這對夫妻是否未來會離婚的是雙方在對話過程中積極還是消極。", "en": "So he recorded what was saidin the conversation, he recorded their skin conductivity, he recorded their facial expressions, their heart rates, their blood pressure, basically everything apart from whetheror not the wife was actually always right, which incidentally she totally is. But what Gottman and his team found was that one of the mostimportant predictors for whether or not a coupleis going to get divorced was how positive or negative each partnerwas being in the conversation."}, {"zh-tw": "那些離婚風險很低的夫妻在 Gottman 的測試中得到了更多正面而不是負面的分數。相反的，在糟糕的關係中，我是指那些可能離婚的夫妻，他們發現自己沈浸在消極的漩渦中。", "en": "Now, couples that were very low-risk scored a lot more positive pointson Gottman's scale than negative. Whereas bad relationships, by which I mean,probably going to get divorced, they found themselves gettinginto a spiral of negativity."}, {"zh-tw": "就用這些非常簡單的方法，Gottman 和他的團隊能夠準確預測一對夫妻是否會離婚,準確率高達 90%。但是，直到他與數學家 James Murray 聯手，他們才真正找出那些消極漩渦是如何產生，為什麼產生的。", "en": "Now just by using these very simple ideas, Gottman and his group were able to predict whether a given couplewas going to get divorced with a 90 percent accuracy. But it wasn't until he teamed upwith a mathematician, James Murray, that they really started to understand what causes these negativity spiralsand how they occur."}, {"zh-tw": "結果是他們發現我認為不可思議太令人驚嘆的簡單而有趣。這些算式，他們用來預測妻子或是丈夫是如何去回應他們下一段對話，他們的積極或消極程度是多少。", "en": "And the results that they found, I think, are just incrediblyimpressively simple and interesting. So these equations predict how the wifeor husband is going to respond in their next turn of the conversation, how positive or negativethey're going to be."}, {"zh-tw": "這些算式，取決於當他們獨處時各自的情緒，當他們和伴侶在一起時候的情緒，但最重要的是，取決於丈夫和妻子相互間的影響。在這個階段我認為最重要的是，這個一模一樣的算式同時也可以完美預測兩個國家是否會開戰。", "en": "And these equations depend on the mood of the personwhen they're on their own, the mood of the person whenthey're with their partner, but most importantly, they depend on how much the husband and wifeinfluence one another. Now, I think it's importantto point out at this stage, that these exact equationshave also been shown to be perfectly able at describing what happens between two countriesin an arms race."}, {"zh-tw": "因此，對沈浸於消極情緒在離婚邊緣搖擺的夫妻──實際在數學上等同於即將開始一場核戰爭。事實上，這個算式最重要的部分是人們給對方帶來的影響，尤其是消極閾值。消極閾值，你可以認為它指的是丈夫討厭到什麼程度就能惹到妻子真的暴怒，或者是相反。", "en": "So that an arguing couplespiraling into negativity and teetering on the brink of divorce is actually mathematically equivalentto the beginning of a nuclear war. But the really important termin this equation is the influence that peoplehave on one another, and in particular, something called\"the negativity threshold.\" Now, the negativity threshold, you can think of ashow annoying the husband can be before the wife starts to getreally pissed off, and vice versa."}, {"zh-tw": "我一直認為美好的婚姻是基於妥協和理解並且給對方留足獨處空間。我會想，最成功的關係是當那裡有非常高的消極閾值時", "en": "Now, I always thought that good marriageswere about compromise and understanding and allowing the personto have the space to be themselves. So I would have thought that perhapsthe most successful relationships were ones where there wasa really high negativity threshold."}, {"zh-tw": "夫妻共同選擇不去理會這些問題。只有在非常嚴重的時候才會嚴肅討論。事實上，團隊得出的數學運算結果和後續研究成果顯示完全相反的結果。", "en": "Where couples let things go and only brought things upif they really were a big deal. But actually, the mathematicsand subsequent findings by the team have shown the exact opposite is true."}, {"zh-tw": "最完美的夫妻，最成功的夫妻，有著很低的消極閾值。這些夫妻不會忽視矛盾給對方抱怨的空間。", "en": "The best couples,or the most successful couples, are the ones with a really lownegativity threshold. These are the couplesthat don't let anything go unnoticed and allow each othersome room to complain."}, {"zh-tw": "這些夫妻持續努力修復他們的關係，他們對自己的婚姻有著非常積極的預期。他們不會忽略矛盾，他們不會讓一件件瑣碎的小事堆積成為巨大的問題。", "en": "These are the couples that are continuallytrying to repair their own relationship, that have a much more positiveoutlook on their marriage. Couples that don't let things go and couples that don't let trivial thingsend up being a really big deal."}, {"zh-tw": "當然，這不僅僅是一個低消極閾值和對成功關係毫不妥協的態度。但我認為，很有趣的是真的有數學證據來證明你永遠不該長時間積攢憤怒，太陽要下山了。（譯注：這句話出自聖經）", "en": "Now of course, it takes a bit morethan just a low negativity threshold and not compromisingto have a successful relationship.

But I hope, that aside fromtheir use as tips, they also give you a little bit of insightinto the power of mathematics."}, {"zh-tw": "對我來說，算式和符號不僅僅是一樣東西。它們表達出自然令人贊嘆的豐富性以及簡化那些我們身邊扭曲、旋轉、包圍、進化的事物，從世界是如何運作的，到人類行為舉止。", "en": "Because for me, equationsand symbols aren't just a thing. They're a voice that speaks outabout the incredible richness of nature and the startling simplicity in the patterns that twist and turnand warp and evolve all around us, from how the world works to how we behave."}, {"zh-tw": "我希望，也許你們中的一部分人能夠瞭解一些愛的數學運算，能夠讓你愛數學稍微多一點。謝謝。（鼓掌）", "en": "So I hope that perhaps,for just a couple of you, a little bit of insightinto the mathematics of love can persuade you to havea little bit more love for mathematics.
