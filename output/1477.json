But you know, these shells,they're hard to find."}, {"zh-tw": "它們被埋在沙子裡，很難發現無論如何，久而久之我就抓到訣竅了", "en": "They're covered in sand,they're difficult to see. However, over time,I got used to looking for them."}, {"zh-tw": "我開始依據它們的形狀和圖案幫助我找尋沙海膽我對尋寶的熱愛也就此產生了我迷上了與過去有關的事物和考古學", "en": "I started seeing shapes and patterns that helped meto collect them. This grew into a passionfor finding things, a love for the past and archaeology."}, {"zh-tw": "終於，在我開始研究埃及古物學後我發現光用肉眼探尋是不夠的因為在埃及，我眼中的沙灘忽然間從緬因州的小沙灘變成了一條八百英哩長的尼羅河沙灘從緬因州的小沙灘變成了一條八百英哩長的尼羅河沙灘", "en": "And eventually, when I startedstudying Egyptology, I realized that seeingwith my naked eyes alone wasn't enough. Because all of the sudden, in Egypt, my beach had grownfrom a tiny beach in Maine to one eight hundred miles long, next to the Nile."}, {"zh-tw": "從緬因州的小沙灘變成了一條八百英哩長的尼羅河沙灘而我的沙海膽也變得和城市一樣巨大而我的沙海膽也變得和城市一樣巨大就是因為這樣，我才開始使用衛星影像", "en": "And my sand dollars had grownto the size of cities. This is really what brought meto using satellite imagery."}, {"zh-tw": "如果想把過去完整的呈現出來，我就得從不同的角度看事情所以我想舉個例子，讓各位知道我們是如何用紅外線來進行另類觀測所以我想舉個例子，讓各位知道我們是如何用紅外線來進行另類觀測", "en": "For trying to map the past,I knew that I had to see differently. So I want to show you an exampleof how we see differently using the infrared."}, {"zh-tw": "這是尼羅河三角洲東部的邦狄克斯這是尼羅河三角洲東部的邦狄克斯這個地點看起來呈現褐色但如果我們用用紅外線加工處理並加上假色影像這個地點瞬間變成了亮粉色", "en": "This is a site locatedin the eastern Egyptian delta called Mendes. And the site visibly appears brown, but when we use the infrared and we process it, all of the sudden, using false color, the site appears as bright pink."}, {"zh-tw": "現在你們看到的是古代埃及人築屋的建材和活動對地表造成的化學轉變是古代埃及人築屋的建材和活動對地表造成的化學轉變是古代埃及人築屋的建材和活動對地表造成的化學轉變今天我想和各位分享的是我們如何藉由衛星資料找到了一座消失了幾千年的埃及古城---伊塔威找到了一座消失了幾千年的埃及古城---伊塔威找到了一座消失了幾千年的埃及古城---伊塔威", "en": "What you are seeing are the actual chemical changesto the landscape caused by the buildingmaterials and activities of the ancient Egyptians. What I want to share with you today is how we've used satellite data to find an ancient Egyptian city, called Itjtawy, missing for thousands of years."}, {"zh-tw": "伊塔威曾是古埃及的首都維持了超過四百年之久這段時間大約在四千多年前古埃及的中王國時期這段時間大約在四千多年前古埃及的中王國時期伊塔威的地點位於埃及的法尤姆市它的位置非常重要因為在中王國時期，曾有一次偉大的古埃及文藝復興包括藝術、建築和宗教層面", "en": "Itjtawy was ancient Egypt's capital for over four hundred years, at a period of timecalled the Middle Kingdom, about four thousand years ago. The site is locatedin the Faiyum of Egypt, and the site is really important, because in the Middle Kingdomthere was this great renaissance for ancient Egyptian art,architecture and religion."}, {"zh-tw": "埃及學家早就知道伊塔威的大概位置約莫位於某兩任法老所建的金字塔群附近也就是圖中的紅色圈圈裡在這廣大沖積平原中的某處這個區域非常的寬廣長寬各為四英哩和三英哩", "en": "Egyptologists have always knownthe site of Itjtawy was located somewhere near the pyramidsof the two kings who built it, indicated within the red circles here, but somewhere withinthis massive flood plain. This area is huge -- it's four miles by three miles in size."}, {"zh-tw": "尼羅河曾流經伊塔威旁邊但後來改變了流向並往東移覆蓋了整座城市我們該如何在寬廣的平原中尋找一座埋藏在地底的城市呢？我們該如何在寬廣的平原中尋找一座埋藏在地底的城市呢？漫無目的的尋找只會像大海撈針一樣不切實際漫無目的的尋找只會像大海撈針一樣不切實際漫無目的的尋找只會像大海撈針一樣不切實際", "en": "The Nile used to flowright next to the city of Itjtawy, and as it shifted and changedand moved over time to the east, it covered over the city. So, how do you find a buried city in a vast landscape? Finding it randomlywould be the equivalent of locating a needle in a haystack, blindfolded, wearing baseball mitts."}, {"zh-tw": "因此我們採用太空總署的地形資料繪出地表景物上極細微的變化由此可見尼羅河曾經流過的地方", "en": "So what we did iswe used NASA topography data to map out the landscape,very subtle changes. We started to be able to seewhere the Nile used to flow."}, {"zh-tw": "你會發現更多的細節，更有趣的是紅色圈圈中這個微微高起的區域很有可能是伊塔威的所在位置很有可能是伊塔威的所在位置於是我們和埃及科學家合作進行岩層採樣，就像這張圖", "en": "But you can see in more detail,and even more interesting, this very slight raised area seen within the circle up here which we thought could possibly bethe location of the city of Itjtawy. So we collaboratedwith Egyptian scientists to do coring work, which you see here."}, {"zh-tw": "岩層採樣就像研究不同時期氣候變遷的冰層採樣只是我們關注的是岩層中人類活動的遺跡向下延伸五公尺在厚厚的泥層下我們找到了一層布滿陶器的岩層", "en": "When I say coring, it's like ice coring, but instead of layers of climate change, you're looking for layersof human occupation. And, five meters down, underneath a thick layer of mud, we found a dense layer of pottery."}, {"zh-tw": "這表示此地可能是伊塔威的所在位置往地下延伸五公尺的地方我們找到了這片藏有數百年前人類活動遺跡的岩層時間可追溯到中王國時期，伊塔威存在的確切時間時間可追溯到中王國時期，伊塔威存在的確切時間同時我們也找到了工藝石材光玉隨、石英和瑪瑙顯示這裡曾經有一間珠寶工坊", "en": "What this shows is thatat this possible location of Itjtawy, five meters down, we have a layer of occupationfor several hundred years, dating to the Middle Kingdom, dating to the exact period of timewe think Itjtawy is. We also found work stone -- carnelian, quartz and agate that shows that there wasa jeweler's workshop here."}, {"zh-tw": "這些石頭看上去或許不太相符但想想中王國時期製造珠寶最常用的石材但想想中王國時期製造珠寶最常用的石材這些石頭也包含其中現在我們有了一片富藏人類遺跡的岩層它的年代追溯到了中王國時期", "en": "These might not look like much, but when you thinkabout the most common stones used in jewelry from the Middle Kingdom, these are the stones that were used. So, we have a dense layer of occupation dating to the Middle Kingdom at this site."}, {"zh-tw": "我們也有證據顯示這裡曾有一間高檔的珠寶工坊這表示，這裡曾經存在著一座非常重要的城市雖然目前伊塔威的遺址尚未完整考掘但我們近期內將會回到那裏，並重現它的完整樣貌但我們近期內將會回到那裏，並重現它的完整樣貌", "en": "We also have evidenceof an elite jeweler's workshop, showing that whatever was therewas a very important city. No Itjtawy was here yet, but we're going to bereturning to the site in the near future to map it out."}, {"zh-tw": "更重要的是我們募款訓練年輕的埃及人教他們如何利用衛星科技這樣他們也能成為探索偉大秘密的一員最後，我想用我最愛的名言來為我的演講做結這句話來自古埃及中王國時代大約誕生於四千多年前的伊塔威", "en": "And even more importantly, we have funding to train young Egyptiansin the use of satellite technology so they can be the onesmaking great discoveries as well. So I wanted to end with my favorite quotefrom the Middle Kingdom -- it was probably writtenat the city of Itjtawy four thousand years ago."}, {"zh-tw": "\"世上最偉大的使命莫過於與他人分享知識\"\"世上最偉大的使命莫過於與他人分享知識\"很顯然，TED不是在西元一九八四年時成立的", "en": "\"Sharing knowledgeis the greatest of all callings. There's nothing like it in the land.\" So as it turns out,TED was not founded in 1984 AD."}, {"zh-tw": "[ 笑聲 ]西元前一九八四年的一座城市中，創造想法早已開始萌芽而這座城市才消失不久，也被我們從空中找到了它證明了在海邊撿貝殼的方法是可行的", "en": "Making ideas actually started in 1984 BC at a not-lost-for-long city,found from above. It certainly puts finding seashellsby the seashore in perspective."}, {"zh-tw": "謝謝各位![ 掌聲 ]謝謝![ 掌聲 ]", "en": "Thank you very much. Thank you."}], "title": "Sarah Parcak Archeology From Space"}
