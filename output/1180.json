Well perhaps some rectangular pieces of plastic with strange symbols on them.

This is no hypothetical question. In fact, this is exactly the kind of question we're faced with when we try to understand the Indus Valley civilization, which existed 4,000 years ago."}, {"zh-tw": "古印度河文明和較為人所熟知的埃及以及美所不達米亞文化同時期但實際上印度河文明的範圍比這兩者還要大它所佔的範圍近乎100萬平方公里涵蓋了今天的巴基斯坦東北印度和部份的阿富汗及伊朗", "en": "The Indus civilization was roughly contemporaneous with the much better known Egyptian and the Mesopotamian civilizations, but it was actually much larger than either of these two civilizations. It occupied the area of approximately one million square kilometers, covering what is now Pakistan, Northwestern India and parts of Afghanistan and Iran."}, {"zh-tw": "如此廣大的文明你可能會期待尋找到主權者，國王以及用來紀念王者的巨大紀念碑事實上考古學者沒有發現那些", "en": "Given that it was such a vast civilization, you might expect to find really powerful rulers, kings, and huge monuments glorifying these powerful kings.

Which of these hypotheses can be true? We don't know, but perhaps if you deciphered the script, you would be able to answer this question."}, {"zh-tw": "但解開這些文字內容不容易第一，我們沒有羅薩塔石", "en": "But deciphering the script is a very challenging task. First, there's no Rosetta Stone."}, {"zh-tw": "我不是指語言學習軟體我是說一件古物分別以我們知道與不知道的文字書寫著同樣文字內容印度河文化中並沒有像那樣的古物", "en": "I don't mean the software; I mean an ancient artifact that contains in the same text both a known text and an unknown text. We don't have such an artifact for the Indus script."}, {"zh-tw": "說得更明白一點，我們不知道他們使用哪種語言而且更糟的是大部份的文字都相當短", "en": "And furthermore, we don't even know what language they spoke. And to make matters even worse, most of the text that we have are extremely short."}, {"zh-tw": "就像我給大家看的，最常發現的是這些印章類的東西他們都非常非常地小這讓我們更難解讀有些人或許會擔心是否真的有誰可以解開古印度河文字呢？", "en": "So as I showed you, they're usually found on these seals that are very, very tiny. And so given these formidable obstacles, one might wonder and worry whether one will ever be able to decipher the Indus script."}, {"zh-tw": "在我接下來的演講中我要來告訴各位我怎麼克服這些解讀障礙並喜歡上解讀古印度河文字所帶來的挑戰我熱衷於古印度河文字大概始自於在中學課本", "en": "In the rest of my talk, I'd like to tell you about how I learned to stop worrying and love the challenge posed by the Indus script. I've always been fascinated by the Indus script ever since I read about it in a middle school textbook."}, {"zh-tw": "為什麼我如此著迷？因為這是目前唯一未被解開的重要古文字符號我的職業是計算神經科學所以我每天的工作就是製造出大腦的電腦模型來試圖瞭解大腦如何預知事物如何下判斷如何學習等", "en": "And why was I fascinated? Well it's the last major undeciphered script in the ancient world. My career path led me to become a computational neuroscientist, so in my day job, I create computer models of the brain to try to understand how the brain makes predictions, how the brain makes decisions, how the brain learns and so on."}, {"zh-tw": "但在2007年，我與古印度河文字重逢我當時人在印度有著很好的機會與印度科學家見面他們使用電腦模型去分析那些文字符號", "en": "But in 2007, my path crossed again with the Indus script. That's when I was in India, and I had the wonderful opportunity to meet with some Indian scientists who were using computer models to try to analyze the script."}, {"zh-tw": "我想到可以藉由這次機會與這些科學家合作所以我抓住了這次機會我想說明我們所發現的一些成果", "en": "And so it was then that I realized there was an opportunity for me to collaborate with these scientists, and so I jumped at that opportunity. And I'd like to describe some of the results that we have found."}, {"zh-tw": "甚至，讓我們一起來解讀這些文字符號準備好了嗎？當你有段未解的文字符號時，你必須先去分辨書寫的方向", "en": "Or better yet, let's all collectively decipher. Are you ready? The first thing that you need to do when you have an undeciphered script is try to figure out the direction of writing."}, {"zh-tw": "這裡有兩段相同符號的文字你能告訴我書寫的方向是由右到左還是左到右呢？我給大家幾分鐘的時間", "en": "Here are two texts that contain some symbols on them. Can you tell me if the direction of writing is right to left or left to right? I'll give you a couple of seconds."}, {"zh-tw": "好！右到左。有多少？好左到右呢？喔，大概一半一半。好", "en": "Okay. Right to left, how many? Okay. Okay. Left to right? Oh, it's almost 50/50. Okay."}, {"zh-tw": "答案是：如果你看這兩段文字的左側你會注意到左邊的符號有點擁擠似乎是4000年前當書寫者從右寫到左時因空間不夠只得縮小間距", "en": "The answer is: if you look at the left-hand side of the two texts, you'll notice that there's a cramping of signs, and it seems like 4,000 years ago, when the scribe was writing from right to left, they ran out of space. And so they had to cram the sign."}, {"zh-tw": "其中有一個符號也出現在下面的文字符號中意味著書寫的方向應該是從右到左所以我們知道的第一件事是書寫方向是語言符號中的關鍵項目", "en": "One of the signs is also below the text on the top. This suggests the direction of writing was probably from right to left, and so that's one of the first things we know, that directionality is a very key aspect of linguistic scripts."}, {"zh-tw": "古印度河文字有個特別的特徵這文字符號中還有什麼其他語言特徵？語言會有一定模式", "en": "And the Indus script now has this particular property. What other properties of language does the script show? Languages contain patterns."}, {"zh-tw": "如果我給你一個字母Ｑ然後請你猜下一個字母，你們覺得會是什麼呢？大部份人都會說Ｕ，答對了現在我請你們再猜下個字母你們覺得會是什麼呢？現在這邊有很多種答案，有人說Ｅ，有人說Ｉ，也可能是Ａ但絕對不是Ｂ,C,Ｄ,對吧？印度河文字也有類似的模式", "en": "If I give you the letter Q and ask you to predict the next letter, what do you think that would be? Most of you said U, which is right. Now if I asked you to predict one more letter, what do you think that would be? Now there's several thoughts. There's E. It could be I. It could be A, but certainly not B, C or D, right? The Indus script also exhibits similar kinds of patterns."}, {"zh-tw": "有很多段文字的開頭都有菱形符號接著下個字會有類似引號的符號", "en": "There's a lot of text that start with this diamond-shaped symbol. And this in turn tends to be followed by this quotation marks-like symbol."}, {"zh-tw": "這非常的類似Ｑ跟Ｕ的例子這符號之後會有著類似魚等其他的符號但不會是最底下出現的這些符號", "en": "And this is very similar to a Q and U example. This symbol can in turn be followed by these fish-like symbols and some other signs, but never by these other signs at the bottom."}, {"zh-tw": "更詳細來說，有些符號比較常出現在文章結尾像是這壺型的記號事實上，這記號剛好是在這些文句中最常出現的記號看出這些慣用模式後，我們有個想法", "en": "And furthermore, there's some signs that really prefer the end of texts, such as this jar-shaped sign, and this sign, in fact, happens to be the most frequently occurring sign in the script. Given such patterns, here was our idea."}, {"zh-tw": "就是用電腦去瞭解這些圖案我們將這些文字符號輸入電腦然後電腦以某種統計模型算出哪些符號會一起出現而哪些符號常以先後順序出現", "en": "The idea was to use a computer to learn these patterns, and so we gave the computer the existing texts. And the computer learned a statistical model of which symbols tend to occur together and which symbols tend to follow each other."}, {"zh-tw": "使用此電腦模式我們可以以測驗的方式測試此模式如此我們可以知道某些符號可以被省去甚至可以重建不完整的文字符號", "en": "Given the computer model, we can test the model by essentially quizzing it. So we could deliberately erase some symbols, and we can ask it to predict the missing symbols."}, {"zh-tw": "這裡有些例子大家可以參考一下比如說像是命運轉輪這種古老的遊戲", "en": "Here are some examples. You may regard this as perhaps the most ancient game of Wheel of Fortune."}, {"zh-tw": "我們發現電腦預測符號的成功率達75%而剩下的25%理論上來說，電腦提供的第二或第三選項也會是正確答案", "en": "What we found was that the computer was successful in 75 percent of the cases in predicting the correct symbol. In the rest of the cases, typically the second best guess or third best guess was the right answer."}, {"zh-tw": "這種預測途徑很實用很多文字符號都已經損毀", "en": "There's also practical use for this particular procedure. There's a lot of these texts that are damaged."}, {"zh-tw": "這裡有個例子我們可以使用電腦模式來修復這段文字內容且做出最佳的猜測", "en": "Here's an example of one such text. And we can use the computer model now to try to complete this text and make a best guess prediction."}, {"zh-tw": "這邊有一成功預測的例子它真的非常有用，在解開文字的過程中讓我們得到了更多可供分析的數據", "en": "Here's an example of a symbol that was predicted. And this could be really useful as we try to decipher the script by generating more data that we can analyze."}, {"zh-tw": "現在多了一件藉由電腦模式解決的例子請想像有隻猴子坐在鍵盤上", "en": "Now here's one other thing you can do with the computer model. So imagine a monkey sitting at a keyboard."}, {"zh-tw": "我猜會得到ㄧ堆像這樣隨機跑出的字母這些隨機混亂的字母說明了很高的熵", "en": "I think you might get a random jumble of letters that looks like this. Such a random jumble of letters is said to have a very high entropy."}, {"zh-tw": "這是物理跟資訊理論說法但想像這是相當隨機混亂的字母排列", "en": "This is a physics and information theory term. But just imagine it's a really random jumble of letters."}, {"zh-tw": "你們有誰曾經將咖啡濺在鍵盤上？可能會有鍵盤卡住的問題所以基本上有些同樣的符號會一再的重複這類的數列可以說有著非常低的熵因為它們一點都沒變化", "en": "How many of you have ever spilled coffee on a keyboard? You might have encountered the stuck-key problem -- so basically the same symbol being repeated over and over again. This kind of a sequence is said to have a very low entropy because there's no variation at all."}, {"zh-tw": "語言，從別個角度說，有著中間程度的熵他的排列不會太單調也不會過於隨機而古印度河文字呢？我們看到以上所有例子的數值", "en": "Language, on the other hand, has an intermediate level of entropy; it's neither too rigid, nor is it too random. What about the Indus script? Here's a graph that plots the entropies of a whole bunch of sequences."}, {"zh-tw": "最上面是排序最為隨機的序列是一連串隨機的字母有趣的是，我們還發現人類ＤＮＡ的排序以及旋律優美的音樂兩者排序都很有彈性這是兩者數值較高", "en": "At the very top you find the uniformly random sequence, which is a random jumble of letters -- and interestingly, we also find the DNA sequence from the human genome and instrumental music. And both of these are very, very flexible, which is why you find them in the very high range."}, {"zh-tw": "在圖表較下方的地方你可以看到最單調的排序是一串字母Ａ你也會發現一種電腦程式一種電腦翻譯語言Fortran即是照著這種嚴謹的規則語言文字符號正落於這些中間值", "en": "At the lower end of the scale, you find a rigid sequence, a sequence of all A's, and you also find a computer program, in this case in the language Fortran, which obeys really strict rules. Linguistic scripts occupy the middle range."}, {"zh-tw": "古印度河文字呢？我們發現它落於語言文字範圍值中這結果首次被公開即引起高度爭議", "en": "Now what about the Indus script? We found that the Indus script actually falls within the range of the linguistic scripts. When this result was first published, it was highly controversial."}, {"zh-tw": "有人提出強烈批評這些批評的人相信古印度河文字根本不是文字我甚至收到一些惡意信函", "en": "There were people who raised a hue and cry, and these people were the ones who believed that the Indus script does not represent language. I even started to get some hate mail."}, {"zh-tw": "我的學生說我應該要好好保護自身安危誰能料到解讀古文字會變成一種危險職業這結果說明了什麼？他說明了古印度河文字有著重要的語言特徵", "en": "My students said that I should really seriously consider getting some protection. Who'd have thought that deciphering could be a dangerous profession? What does this result really show? It shows that the Indus script shares an important property of language."}, {"zh-tw": "所以，就像古老的諺語說得如果這看起來像是語言性文字且它也有語言性文字的功用那麼我們所擁有的就是語言性文字有什麼其他證據顯示這類文字能對解譯語言呢？語言性文字的確能解譯多種語言", "en": "So, as the old saying goes, if it looks like a linguistic script and it acts like a linguistic script, then perhaps we may have a linguistic script on our hands. What other evidence is there that the script could actually encode language? Well linguistic scripts can actually encode multiple languages."}, {"zh-tw": "例如，一句英文還有一句相同的荷蘭文都用同樣的字母如果你不懂荷蘭文，只懂英文你看一些荷蘭文你會告訴我裡面有些字的排序很奇怪", "en": "So for example, here's the same sentence written in English and the same sentence written in Dutch using the same letters of the alphabet. If you don't know Dutch and you only know English and I give you some words in Dutch, you'll tell me that these words contain some very unusual patterns."}, {"zh-tw": "有點不對勁你會說這些字不是英文在古印度河文字中，也是同樣的道理", "en": "Some things are not right, and you'll say these words are probably not English words. The same thing happens in the case of the Indus script."}, {"zh-tw": "電腦發現了一些文字這裡有兩段他們都有著非常少見的符號以第一個例子來說可以看到兩個壺形記號出現", "en": "The computer found several texts -- two of them are shown here -- that have very unusual patterns. So for example the first text: there's a doubling of this jar-shaped sign."}, {"zh-tw": "這種記號是最常在古印度河文字中發現的符號但只有在這以一對的方式出現為什麼在這裡是是這樣呢？我們回頭看這些文字符號的出處發現他們來自離古印度河文明非常非常遠的地方", "en": "This sign is the most frequently-occurring sign in the Indus script, and it's only in this text that it occurs as a doubling pair. Why is that the case? We went back and looked at where these particular texts were found, and it turns out that they were found very, very far away from the Indus Valley."}, {"zh-tw": "他們來自現今的伊拉克以及伊朗為何出處會在那裡？我還沒跟你說的是古印度人很會做生意", "en": "They were found in present day Iraq and Iran. And why were they found there? What I haven't told you is that the Indus people were very, very enterprising."}, {"zh-tw": "他們常和遠地區的人們做生意也因此，他們會越洋交易交易地區遍及美索不達米亞，亦即現今的伊拉克我們所看到的是印度商人用他們的文字符號寫下外來語", "en": "They used to trade with people pretty far away from where they lived, and so in this case, they were traveling by sea all the way to Mesopotamia, present-day Iraq. And what seems to have happened here is that the Indus traders, the merchants, were using this script to write a foreign language."}, {"zh-tw": "就像我們這邊所舉的英文以及荷蘭語意思相同這也是我們看到這些異常排序的原因它們和你看到古印度河文字符號大相徑庭", "en": "It's just like our English and Dutch example. And that would explain why we have these strange patterns that are very different from the kinds of patterns you see in the text that are found within the Indus Valley."}, {"zh-tw": "這也意謂著，同樣的古印度文字符號可能被用在不同的語言上我們從此可論斷古印度河的文字符號，的確是語言", "en": "This suggests that the same script, the Indus script, could be used to write different languages. The results we have so far seem to point to the conclusion that the Indus script probably does represent language."}, {"zh-tw": "它的確代表一種語言我們如何解讀這些符號呢？這是我們接下來的難題所以你會注意到這些符號看起來像是人，像是昆蟲像魚，像鳥", "en": "If it does represent language, then how do we read the symbols? That's our next big challenge. So you'll notice that many of the symbols look like pictures of humans, of insects, of fishes, of birds."}, {"zh-tw": "大部份的古代文字符號都是象形字以圖像代表文字像之前的例子，這裡有個字", "en": "Most ancient scripts use the rebus principle, which is, using pictures to represent words. So as an example, here's a word."}, {"zh-tw": "你可以用圖畫來寫它嗎？我給你幾分鐘時間好了嗎？很好！", "en": "Can you write it using pictures? I'll give you a couple seconds. Got it? Okay. Great."}, {"zh-tw": "這是我的解決方法你可以先畫一隻蜜蜂，接著畫一片樹葉這就代表 “相信”，對吧", "en": "Here's my solution. You could use the picture of a bee followed by a picture of a leaf -- and that's \"belief,\" right."}, {"zh-tw": "還有其他畫法在古印度河文字裡問題剛好相反", "en": "There could be other solutions. In the case of the Indus script, the problem is the reverse."}, {"zh-tw": "你必須先瞭解每個圖像的聲音才能瞭解整個排序的意思就像是字謎遊戲只不過這是所有字謎遊戲之始因為代價實在太高了", "en": "You have to figure out the sounds of each of these pictures such that the entire sequence makes sense. So this is just like a crossword puzzle, except that this is the mother of all crossword puzzles because the stakes are so high if you solve it."}, {"zh-tw": "我的同事，曼哈達凡以及巴布達對這問題都頗有心得我可以讓你看一下巴布達的成果", "en": "My colleagues, Iravatham Mahadevan and Asko Parpola, have been making some headway on this particular problem. And I'd like to give you a quick example of Parpola's work."}, {"zh-tw": "這是很短的文字符號有七條直線後面有一條魚的圖象", "en": "Here's a really short text. It contains seven vertical strokes followed by this fish-like sign."}, {"zh-tw": "我想要說明這些印章是被用來蓋在黏土標簽然後被貼在貨物上所以它會很像這些標簽，至少其中的某些有著商號的名字在印度長久以來即習慣以星座來命名以星群象徵出生時間", "en": "And I want to mention that these seals were used for stamping clay tags that were attached to bundles of goods, so it's quite likely that these tags, at least some of them, contain names of merchants. And it turns out that in India there's a long tradition of names being based on horoscopes and star constellations present at the time of birth."}, {"zh-tw": "在德拉威語系裡魚的發音是 “meen\"而這個字的發音跟星星剛好相同所以七顆星星代表 \"elu meen\"就是德拉威語的北斗七星", "en": "In Dravidian languages, the word for fish is \"meen\" which happens to sound just like the word for star. And so seven stars would stand for \"elu meen,\" which is the Dravidian word for the Big Dipper star constellation."}, {"zh-tw": "同樣地，這裡有六顆星可以翻成 ”aru meen\"在德拉威語代表昴宿星團事實上，還有其他的組合像是，魚的圖象上有個蓋子", "en": "Similarly, there's another sequence of six stars, and that translates to \"aru meen,\" which is the old Dravidian name for the star constellation Pleiades. And finally, there's other combinations, such as this fish sign with something that looks like a roof on top of it."}, {"zh-tw": "可以翻成 \"mey meen\"在德拉威語意思是土星讓人感到振奮的是", "en": "And that could be translated into \"mey meen,\" which is the old Dravidian name for the planet Saturn. So that was pretty exciting."}, {"zh-tw": "我們似乎有所進展這證明這些印章有著以行星以及星群來命名的德威語但不是這樣就結束了", "en": "It looks like we're getting somewhere. But does this prove that these seals contain Dravidian names based on planets and star constellations? Well not yet."}, {"zh-tw": "我們仍無法證實這樣的解讀方式無誤但如果越來越多的解讀都有道理越來越長的排序解讀都是正確的我們就能知道這樣的方法是對的今天我們可以用埃及象形文字以及楔形文字寫下ＴＥＤ這樣的名字因為人們在十九世紀早已解開兩者的文字符號內容", "en": "So we have no way of validating these particular readings, but if more and more of these readings start making sense, and if longer and longer sequences appear to be correct, then we know that we are on the right track. Today, we can write a word such as TED in Egyptian hieroglyphics and in cuneiform script, because both of these were deciphered in the 19th century."}, {"zh-tw": "對於兩種文字的解讀使得我們現在能瞭解過去的文明二十世紀我們也開始瞭解馬亞文明但我們至今仍無法瞭解古印度河文明", "en": "The decipherment of these two scripts enabled these civilizations to speak to us again directly. The Mayans started speaking to us in the 20th century, but the Indus civilization remains silent."}, {"zh-tw": "為什麼我們需要這麼在乎印度河文明不僅屬於南印度或是北印度人或是巴基斯坦人這屬於我們所有人這些是我們的祖先你我共同的祖先", "en": "Why should we care? The Indus civilization does not belong to just the South Indians or the North Indians or the Pakistanis; it belongs to all of us. These are our ancestors -- yours and mine."}, {"zh-tw": "他們因為遭遇了某個不幸的歷史意外而不為人知如果我們解開了這些文字符號就能再次瞭解這些符號的意義", "en": "They were silenced by an unfortunate accident of history. If we decipher the script, we would enable them to speak to us again."}, {"zh-tw": "他們會傳達什麼呢？我們又會發現什麼呢？是關於我們的事情嗎？我等不及發現謝謝大家（鼓掌）", "en": "What would they tell us? What would we find out about them?
