Our first study of peoplewho were happily in love has been widely publicized, so I'm only going to sayvery little about it."}, {"zh-tw": "我們在靠近腦底部的小地方發現腦部活動該處叫做腹側蓋區 (VTA)我們發現了一些名為 ApEn 的細胞這些細胞負責製造多巴胺這種自然的激素然後將之送到腦部的許多區域", "en": "We found activity in a tiny,little factory near the base of the brain called the ventral tegmental area.

It was very difficult actually,putting these people in the machine, because they were in such bad shape."}, {"zh-tw": "總之，我們在 3 個腦區發現活動其中一個活動的腦區竟然就是那個與強烈的愛情相關的腦區", "en": "So anyway, we found activityin three brain regions.

Two thousand years later,we can explain this in the brain."}, {"zh-tw": "這一個大腦系統，這個回饋系統負責欲望、動機、渴望和專注在無法遂願時，反而更加活躍就這樣，我們得到生命賜予的最大獻禮一個合適的交配伴侶", "en": "That brain system -- the reward system for wanting, for motivation,for craving, for focus -- becomes more activewhen you can't get what you want. In this case, life's greatest prize:an appropriate mating partner."}, {"zh-tw": "我們也在其他腦區發現活動在計算得失的腦區你知道的，你躺在那，看著相片在機器裡你同時也在算計，自己做錯了什麼？", "en": "We found activityin other brain regions also -- in a brain region associatedwith calculating gains and losses. You're lying there,you're looking at the picture, and you're in this machine, and you're calculating what went wrong."}, {"zh-tw": "為什麼失敗，又失去了什麼？實際上，露西跟我還就這個情況說了個小笑話靈感是大衛馬蒙的戲戲中有男女兩個騙子女的試著誘騙男人上鉤但這個男人看著女人，然後說喔，妳少耍心機了，我才不會上當呢這就是這一個腦區阿肯柏氏核的中樞開始活動就在我們計算得失的時候", "en": "What have I lost? As a matter of fact, Lucy and Ihave a little joke about this. It comes from a David Mamet play, and there's two con artists in the play, and the woman is conning the man, and the man looks at the woman and says, \"Oh, you're a bad pony,I'm not going to bet on you.\" And indeed, it's this part of the brain, the core of the nucleus accumbens, that is becoming activeas you're measuring your gains and losses."}, {"zh-tw": "這個腦區也會開始活躍當我們自願冒極大的險以得到巨大的報償或損失最後，但卻重要的是，我們在一個腦區發現的活動這和對另一個體的深度依戀有關", "en": "It's also the brain regionthat becomes active when you're willing to take enormous risksfor huge gains and huge losses. Last but not least,we found activity in a brain region associated with deep attachmentto another individual."}, {"zh-tw": "難怪世上的人都在受苦而且有那麼多因愛犯罪的案例當我們在愛中遭到拒絕我們不只在愛情中滅頂還會對對方產生深度的依戀", "en": "No wonder people suffer around the world,and we have so many crimes of passion. When you've been rejected in love, not only are you engulfedwith feelings of romantic love, but you're feeling deepattachment to this individual."}, {"zh-tw": "而且，大腦回饋迴路的作用我們感到極度有活力、專注極度有動力且非常願意窮盡一切贏得生命的大禮那麼，我到底從這項實驗中學到什麼？我想告訴大家什麼？首先，我開始認為愛情是一種慾望，一種引發交配本能的慾望它不是性慾，因為性慾讓你忘了愛情", "en": "Moreover, this brain circuitfor reward is working, and you're feeling intense energy,intense focus, intense motivation and the willingness to risk it all,to win life's greatest prize. So, what have I learnedfrom this experiment that I would like to tell the world? Foremost, I have come to think that romantic love is a drive,a basic mating drive."}, {"zh-tw": "尋找各式各樣的性伴侶真正的愛情讓我們只將交配精力聚焦在單一對象一次針對一個人，保留我們的交配精力然後跟這個單一對象，開始交配過程", "en": "Not the sex drive -- the sex drive gets you lookingfor a whole range of partners. Romantic love enables youto focus your mating energy on just one at a time,conserve your mating energy, and start the mating processwith this single individual."}, {"zh-tw": "回想所有我讀過的情詩柏拉圖說得最好超過 2,000 年前他說「需求產生愛」", "en": "I think of all the poetrythat I've read about romantic love, what sums it up bestis something that is said by Plato over 2,000 years ago. He said, \"The god of lovelives in a state of need."}, {"zh-tw": "愛是需求，是衝動是內在恆定的失衡就像饑渴，幾乎不可能壓抑消滅我也開始相信，愛情是一種癮一種在順遂時，極度美好情況有變時則極度糟糕的癮", "en": "It is a need, it is an urge,it is a homeostatic imbalance. Like hunger and thirst,it's almost impossible to stamp out.\" I've also come to believethat romantic love is an addiction: a perfectly wonderful addictionwhen it's going well, and a perfectly horrible addictionwhen it's going poorly."}, {"zh-tw": "實際上，愛也有許多和上癮相同的特性我們專注於一個人、無法自拔的想他、渴望他、不惜扭曲事實為了抱得良人歸，我們願意冒極大的險", "en": "And indeed, it has allof the characteristics of addiction. You focus on the person,you obsessively think about them, you crave them, you distort reality, your willingness to take enormousrisks to win this person."}, {"zh-tw": "所以，愛情有這 3 大成癮的特性泰倫斯說「你需要更常見到他，再更常見到他」戒癮，之後復發我有個女性朋友，剛結束一段糟糕的戀情", "en": "And it's got the three maincharacteristics of addiction: tolerance, you need to see themmore, and more, and more; withdrawals; and last: relapse. I've got a girlfriend who's justgetting over a terrible love affair."}, {"zh-tw": "8 個月過去了，她開始覺得好一些有一天她正在開車突然聽見收音機放出一首歌讓她想起這個男人", "en": "It's been about eight months,she's beginning to feel better. And she was driving alongin her car the other day, and suddenly she heard a songon the car radio that reminded her of this man."}, {"zh-tw": "最後她，不只是感到那種迫切渴望又回來了她還不得不靠邊將車停在路邊大哭一場因此，我希望醫學界、法學界，甚至是大學學界試著理解，事實上愛情是世上最容易成癮的毒品", "en": "Not only did the instantcraving come back, but she had to pull overfrom the side of the road and cry. So, one thing I would likethe medical community, and the legal community,and even the college community, to see if they can understand,that indeed, romantic love is one of the most addictivesubstances on Earth."}, {"zh-tw": "我也希望告訴大家，動物也會愛這世上沒有一種動物會任意無選擇的交配", "en": "I would also like to tell the worldthat animals love. There's not an animal on this planet that will copulate with anythingthat comes along."}, {"zh-tw": "太老、太小、太髒、太笨，就不會交配除非困在實驗室籠子裡你知道，要是一輩子都在小盒子裡對於性伴侶，就不會這麼挑剔不過我觀察了一千種物種在野外，動物就是會大小眼", "en": "Too old, too young, too scruffy,too stupid, and they won't do it. Unless you're stuckin a laboratory cage -- and you know, if you spendyour entire life in a little box, you're not going to be as pickyabout who you have sex with, but I've looked in a hundred species, and everywhere in the wild,animals have favorites."}, {"zh-tw": "實際上動物學家也知道這點他們用 4 個詞形容動物的大小眼選擇知覺、交配選擇、雌性選擇、性選擇", "en": "As a matter of fact,ethologists know this. There are over eight wordsfor what they call \"animal favoritism:\" selective proceptivity, mate choice,female choice, sexual choice."}, {"zh-tw": "而且，已有 3 篇學術論文研究這樣的吸引力雖然只維持短短一秒這就是一種吸引力同樣的腦部區域，這種回饋系統或是回饋系統的化學作用都與之相關實際上，我認為動物的吸引力可能在當下馬上發生我們可以看見大象馬上走向另一隻大象", "en": "And indeed, there are nowthree academic articles in which they've lookedat this attraction, which may only last for a second, but it's a definite attraction, and either this same brain region,this reward system, or the chemicals of that rewardsystem are involved. In fact, I think animal attractioncan be instant -- you can see an elephantinstantly go for another elephant."}, {"zh-tw": "我認為這就是一個開始開始了我們口中的「一見鍾情」大家常問我我對愛情的了解，會不會讓我對愛情失去興趣我只能說，一點也不正如我們知道巧克力蛋糕的所有材料不過，真正坐下來吃蛋糕時還是覺得很享受", "en": "And I think that this is really the origin of what you and I call\"love at first sight.\" People have often asked me whether what I know about lovehas spoiled it for me. And I just simply say, \"Hardly.\" You can know every single ingredientin a piece of chocolate cake, and then when you sit downand eat that cake, you can still feel that joy."}, {"zh-tw": "當然，我還是會犯同樣的錯犯天下人都會犯的錯不過，這一切都加深了我的了解我對各種人的同理心，其實，在紐約，我常發現自己望著嬰兒車，對裡面的寶寶感到一點遺憾", "en": "And certainly, I make all the samemistakes that everybody else does too, but it's really deepened my understanding and compassion, really,for all human life. As a matter of fact, in New York,I often catch myself looking in baby carriagesand feeling a little sorry for the tot."}, {"zh-tw": "而且，我有時候也覺得有些遺憾看著盤中的雞想到這些大腦系統有多強大我們最新的研究催生者便是我的同事亞特愛倫讓聲稱依然相愛的人們用 MRI 掃描這些身處長期關係中的人們", "en": "And in fact, sometimesI feel a little sorry for the chicken on my dinner plate, when I think of how intensethis brain system is.

There are still many questionsto be answered and asked about romantic love."}, {"zh-tw": "目前我正在努力的問題我只稍微談一下，然後就做結語問題就是，我們為什麼只愛上這個人，而不是其他人？我從未思考過這個問題不過 Match.com 這個線上約會網站3 年前找到我，問了這個問題我只能說，我不知道", "en": "The question that I'm working onright this minute -- and I'm only going to say itfor a second, and then end -- is, why do you fall in lovewith one person, rather than another?

And so, I've spentthe last three years on this."}, {"zh-tw": "因為許多因素，我們愛上某人而不是其他人。心理學家也這麼告訴我們而且我們比較容易愛上社經背景相同、知識程度相同、外貌相配、信仰價值觀相同的人", "en": "And there are many reasonsthat you fall in love with one person rather than another,that psychologists can tell you.

And that's about it, that's all they know."}, {"zh-tw": "不，他們從未發現過兩種不同的人格互相結合且營造出良好的關係因此，我有了個想法也許我們受到的是生理的驅使受特定人士的吸引", "en": "No, they've never found the way two personalitiesfit together to make a good relationship. So, it began to occur to me that maybe your biology pulls youtowards some people rather than another."}, {"zh-tw": "最後我設計了問卷，可以反應出人們受多巴胺、血清素、 雌激素和睪固酮素影響的程度我想我們演化出了 4 種非常大的人格分類與腦中這 4 種化學物質有關", "en": "And I have concocted a questionnaireto see to what degree you express dopamine, serotonin,estrogen and testosterone.
