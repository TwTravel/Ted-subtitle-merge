And I've heard the popular wisdomthat that has to do with finding meaning."}, {"zh-tw": "很久以來，我以為「意義」存在著，就像某個待人尋找的真相。但經過一段時間，我開始覺得真相並不重要。", "en": "And for a long time, I thought the meaning was out there, some great truth waiting to be found. But over time, I've come to feelthat the truth is irrelevant."}, {"zh-tw": "我們稱之為找尋意義，或許應該說是鑄造意義才對。我的新書是關於家庭如何應對各種挑戰或是子女異於常人。我訪談的其中一位母親，兩個孩子都有多重嚴重身障，她告訴我：「很多人都會告訴我們一些俗語像是『上帝絕不會給你超過你能負荷的試煉。』但像我們家的孩子，卻不註定是禮物。", "en": "We call it \"finding meaning,\" but we might better callit \"forging meaning.\" My last book was abouthow families manage to deal with various kinds of challengingor unusual offspring. And one of the mothers I interviewed, who had two childrenwith multiple severe disabilities, said to me, \"People always give usthese little sayings like, 'God doesn't give youany more than you can handle.' But children like oursare not preordained as a gift."}, {"zh-tw": "他們之所以為禮物，只因是我們所選擇的。」我們一生都在做這種決定。當我國小二年級時，巴比．芬可辦了個慶生會，並邀請全班參加，除了我以外。", "en": "They're a gift because that's what we have chosen.\" We make those choices all our lives. When I was in second grade, Bobby Finkel had a birthday party and invited everyone in our class but me."}, {"zh-tw": "我媽以為或許是哪裡弄錯，所以打給芬可的媽媽。她卻告訴我母親，巴比不喜歡我，所以不要我參加他的慶生會。當天，我媽帶我到動物園，還買了個熔岩巧克力聖代給我。", "en": "My mother assumedthere had been some sort of error, and she called Mrs. Finkel, who said that Bobby didn't like meand didn't want me at his party. And that day, my mom took me to the zoo and out for a hot fudge sundae."}, {"zh-tw": "我國一時，校車上有位同學替我取了綽號「波西」來取笑我的言行舉止。有時候，他和同夥會不斷覆頌這詞。整段來回學校的公車上，45 分鐘上學、45 分鐘放學的路上，不斷喊：「波西！波西！波西！」我國二時，科學課的老師說所有男同性戀都會大便失禁，因為肛門括約肌的損傷。", "en": "When I was in seventh grade, one of the kids on my school busnicknamed me \"Percy,\" as a shorthand for my demeanor.

Percy!\" When I was in eighth grade,our science teacher told us that all male homosexualsdevelop fecal incontinence because of the traumato their anal sphincter."}, {"zh-tw": "我高中畢業以前從沒去過學校餐廳，因為如果去了，我也會跟女生坐在一起，然後因此被取笑；或是與男生坐一起，然後被取笑我是個該跟女生坐一塊的男孩子。我之所以安然度過童年，都是透過逃避跟忍受。", "en": "And I graduated high schoolwithout ever going to the cafeteria, where I would have sat with the girlsand been laughed at for doing so, or sat with the boys, and been laughed at for being a boywho should be sitting with the girls. I survived that childhoodthrough a mix of avoidance and endurance."}, {"zh-tw": "我當時並不知道，而現在已經知道的是，逃避和忍受會是鑄造意義的起點。在你鑄造意義之後，需要將這意義融入到新的身分中。", "en": "What I didn't know then and do know now, is that avoidance and endurancecan be the entryway to forging meaning. After you've forged meaning, you need to incorporate that meaninginto a new identity."}, {"zh-tw": "你需要讓經歷過的創傷成為自己的一部分，並將人生中經歷過的最糟事件化為勝利的故事，成為更好的自己，以回應那些曾傷害你的事。我寫書時所訪談過的其中一位母親在青少年時期曾被強暴，還因此懷孕生子，讓她必須從此拋棄原有的事業計劃，且重創了她所有的感情關係。", "en": "You need to take the traumas and make them partof who you've come to be, and you need to foldthe worst events of your life into a narrative of triumph, evincing a better selfin response to things that hurt.

And some are things that happen to us: being a political prisoner,being a rape victim, being a Katrina survivor."}, {"zh-tw": "建立身分需要進到一個社群，從那社群中找尋力量，並給予社群力量。需要用「而且」代替「但是」，不要說：「我還活著，但我患有癌症。」而是說：「我患有癌症，而我還活著。」當我們羞愧的時候，我們就無法述說自己的故事，而這些故事正是身分的基礎。", "en": "Identity involves entering a community to draw strength from that community, and to give strength there, too. It involves substituting\"and\" for \"but\" -- not \"I am here but I have cancer,\" but rather, \"I have cancer and I am here.\" When we're ashamed,we can't tell our stories, and stories are the foundation of identity."}, {"zh-tw": "鑄造意義、建立身分；鑄造意義、建立身分。", "en": "Forge meaning, build identity.

In January of this year, I went to Myanmarto interview political prisoners, and I was surprised to find themless bitter than I'd anticipated."}, {"zh-tw": "大部分的政治犯明知道他們所犯下的罪會讓他們進監獄，但仍昂首地走進獄中，多年後同樣昂首地走出來。馬蒂妲醫生是人權積極分子，她差點死在監獄中，且有好幾年都在單獨監禁中度過。她告訴我，她很感激那些獄吏讓她有時間思考、讓她更有智慧、讓她有機會增進冥想技巧。", "en": "Most of them had knowinglycommitted the offenses that landed them in prison, and they had walked inwith their heads held high, and they walked outwith their heads still held high, many years later. Dr. Ma Thida, a leadinghuman rights activist who had nearly died in prison and had spent many yearsin solitary confinement, told me she was grateful to her jailersfor the time she had had to think, for the wisdom she had gained, for the chance to honeher meditation skills."}, {"zh-tw": "她也尋求這其中的意義，並將痛苦轉為很重要的一種身分。但如果我遇見的這些人對於身在監獄比我想像中的更加泰然，那他們也比我預料中的更不期待他們國家所經歷的改革過程。", "en": "She had sought meaning and made her travailinto a crucial identity.

Which is to say, you can forge meaning and build identity and still be mad as hell."}, {"zh-tw": "我沒有被強暴過，也從來沒有做過任何會被關進緬甸監獄的事。但身為同性戀的美國人，我經歷過偏見甚至仇恨，我鑄造過意義也建立過身分，這是我從那些比我經歷過更糟糕處境的人身上學到的對策。", "en": "I've never been raped, and I've never been in anythingremotely approaching a Burmese prison. But as a gay American, I've experienced prejudiceand even hatred, and I've forged meaning and I've built identity, which is a move I learned from people who had experienced far worse privationthan I've ever known."}, {"zh-tw": "我自己的青少年時期，也曾為了改變性向而做出極端之舉。我參與了一種性向替代療法。裡面有所謂的醫生，需要做所謂的療法，對象是所謂的女性代理人，這些代理人不算妓女，但也不算是其他別的。", "en": "In my own adolescence, I went to extreme lengthsto try to be straight. I enrolled myself in something called\"sexual surrogacy therapy,\" in which peopleI was encouraged to call doctors prescribed what I was encouragedto call exercises with women I was encouragedto call surrogates, who were not exactly prostitutes but who were alsonot exactly anything else."}, {"zh-tw": "我最喜歡的代理人是一位來自南方腹地的金髮女人，後來終於跟我承認她有戀屍癖，她之所以會做這份工作，是因為她在停屍間遇到了點麻煩。這種經驗終究讓我跟女性有種蠻愉悅的肢體關係，對此我很感激，", "en": "My particular favoritewas a blonde woman from the Deep South who eventually admitted to methat she was really a necrophiliac, and had taken this jobafter she got in trouble down at the morgue. These experiences eventuallyallowed me to have some happy physicalrelationships with women, for which I'm grateful."}, {"zh-tw": "但我陷入與自己的戰爭中，也在我心底埋下很深的創傷。我們並不找尋會鑿開身分的痛苦經驗，但我們尋找的身分是尾隨痛苦經驗而來的。", "en": "But I was at war with myself, and I dug terrible woundsinto my own psyche. We don't seek the painful experiences that hew our identities, but we seek our identities in the wake of painful experiences."}, {"zh-tw": "我們無法承受無意義的折磨，但我們可以忍受極大的痛苦，只要我們相信這是有意義的。泰然在我們身上留下的印記比掙扎更淺。", "en": "We cannot bear a pointless torment, but we can endure great pain if we believe that it's purposeful. Ease makes less of an impression on us than struggle."}, {"zh-tw": "沒有喜樂我們還是可以做自己，但沒了驅使我們找尋意義的厄運那就做不到。「因此，我以軟弱為歡喜，」聖保羅在哥林多後書裡寫道，「因為當我軟弱時，我就能變得剛強。」1988 年，我去了莫斯科訪問蘇聯地鐵的藝術家，", "en": "We could have been ourselveswithout our delights, but not without the misfortunesthat drive our search for meaning. \"Therefore, I takepleasure in infirmities,\" St. Paul wrote in Second Corinthians, \"for when I am weak, then I am strong.\" In 1988, I went to Moscowto interview artists of the Soviet underground."}, {"zh-tw": "我期望他們的作品是充滿異議及政治的。但他們作品中的激進其實是為了將人性重放回社會中，因為這個社會正在泯滅人性，某些方面看來，這樣的事在俄羅斯社會正在重演。", "en": "I expected their workto be dissident and political. But the radicalism in their work actually lay in reinsertinghumanity into a society that was annihilating humanity itself, as, in some senses,Russian society is now doing again."}, {"zh-tw": "其中一位藝術家告訴我：「我們被訓練做天使，而非藝術家」。1991 年，我又回去見了這些我筆下的藝術家，當推翻蘇聯的政變發生時，我正與他們在一起，他們也與推動政變的主要發起人一起。", "en": "One of the artists I met said to me, \"We were in training to benot artists but angels.\" In 1991, I went back to seethe artists I'd been writing about, and I was with them during the putschthat ended the Soviet Union. And they were among the chief organizersof the resistance to that putsch."}, {"zh-tw": "政變第三天，有人建議我們走到斯摩棱斯克。我們到那時，在路障前面找個位置待著。一會兒過後，一排坦克車過來，", "en": "And on the third day of the putsch, one of them suggestedwe walk up to Smolenskaya. And we went there, and we arranged ourselvesin front of one of the barricades, and a little while later, a column of tanks rolled up."}, {"zh-tw": "第一輛坦克車上的士兵說：「我們有令，不論如何都要破壞這些柵欄。如果你們現在讓開，那我們就不會傷害你們。", "en": "And the soldier on the front tank said, \"We have unconditional ordersto destroy this barricade.

Give us just a minuteto tell you why we're here.\" And the soldier folded his arms, and the artist launched intoa Jeffersonian panegyric to democracy such as those of us who livein a Jeffersonian democracy would be hard-pressed to present."}, {"zh-tw": "他們一直說下去，而士兵也看著，他聽完後，在那裡坐滿一分鐘，就在雨中看著滿是泥濘的我們，說道：「你們說的是事實，而我們必須遵從人民的意志。", "en": "And they went on and on, and the soldier watched. And then he sat there for a full minuteafter they were finished and looked at us,so bedraggled in the rain, and said, \"What you have said is true, and we must bow to the will of the people."}, {"zh-tw": "如果你們願意讓路讓我們掉頭，那我們會照原路回去。」他們也確實這麼做了。有時候，鑄造意義可以給你所需的詞彙，讓你爭取最終的自由。", "en": "If you'll clear enough spacefor us to turn around, we'll go back the way we came.\" And that's what they did. Sometimes, forging meaningcan give you the vocabulary you need to fight for your ultimate freedom."}, {"zh-tw": "俄羅斯讓我想到檸檬汁的概念，壓榨只會助長反對勢力，而我漸漸了解這就是身分的基石。", "en": "Russia awakened me to the lemonade notion that oppression breedsthe power to oppose it. And I gradually understood thatas the cornerstone of identity."}, {"zh-tw": "身分將我從悲傷中拯救出來。在同志權運動所設想的世界裡，我的缺陷是種勝利。", "en": "It took identityto rescue me from sadness. The gay rights movement posits a world in which my aberrances are a victory."}, {"zh-tw": "身分政治總有兩個目標：讓有特殊情況或特徵的人自豪，以及讓外面的世界以更溫和的方式善待那些人。這是兩種很不同的目標，但不管是哪一邊的進展，都能在另一邊得到回響。", "en": "Identity politicsalways works on two fronts: to give pride to people who havea given condition or characteristic, and to cause the outside worldto treat such people more gently and more kindly. Those are two totallyseparate enterprises, but progress in each spherereverberates in the other."}, {"zh-tw": "身分政治也可以是很自戀的。人們吹捧與眾不同，只因為他們就是如此。", "en": "Identity politics can be narcissistic. People extol a differenceonly because it's theirs."}, {"zh-tw": "人們窄化個別群體的世界及功能，對他人沒有同理心。但只要充分理解並聰明執行，身分政治應該可以擴展我們對於人性的想法。", "en": "People narrow the worldand function in discrete groups without empathy for one another. But properly understoodand wisely practiced, identity politics should expandour idea of what it is to be human."}, {"zh-tw": "身分本身不應該是沾沾自喜的標籤，也不該是金牌，而是革命。如果我是異性戀，那我的生活會輕鬆些，但那就不會是我了。", "en": "Identity itself should benot a smug label or a gold medal, but a revolution. I would have had an easier lifeif I were straight, but I would not be me."}, {"zh-tw": "現在，我更喜歡做自己，而非成為其他人的想法，老實說那樣的人，我不只根本當不成，也無法想像他們的生活。但如果你驅除惡龍，你也驅逐了英雄，我們也會變得依賴自己生命中英雄特質。", "en": "And I now like being myself better than the idea of being someone else, someone who, to be honest, I have neither the option of beingnor the ability fully to imagine. But if you banish the dragons,you banish the heroes, and we become attachedto the heroic strain in our own lives."}, {"zh-tw": "我有時候會想我有沒有辦法停止憎恨那部分的自己，不需藉由同志自豪日的豔麗慶典，而這場演講就是其中一種表現方式。我之前認為自己真正成長的時候，就是我能不多強調自己同志身分地當同志，", "en": "I've sometimes wondered whether I could have ceasedto hate that part of myself without gay pride's technicolor fiesta, of which this speech is one manifestation. I used to think I would knowmyself to be mature when I could simply be gaywithout emphasis."}, {"zh-tw": "但那時期的自我厭惡留下了一塊空白，需要歡樂的事來填滿它，但即使我還清自己的悲傷債，外面還是有恐懼同志的世界，這需要幾十年的時間解決。有一天，當同性戀只會是個簡單的事實，沒有區分與指責。", "en": "But the self-loathingof that period left a void, and celebration needsto fill and overflow it, and even if I repaymy private debt of melancholy, there's still an outer world of homophobia that it will take decades to address. Someday, being gay will be a simple fact, free of party hats and blame."}, {"zh-tw": "但這天還沒到。我有個朋友覺得同志自豪日好像辦得越來越過火，然後建議我們舉辦同志謙遜週。", "en": "But not yet. A friend of mine who thought gay pridewas getting very carried away with itself, once suggested that we organizeGay Humility Week."}, {"zh-tw": "這想法很好，但時候未到。", "en": "It's a great idea. But its time has not yet come."}, {"zh-tw": "還有中立性，看似就位在絕望與慶祝中間，其實就是終局。在美國的 29 州裡，我可以被合法開除或拒絕居住，就因為我是同性戀。", "en": "And neutrality, which seems to liehalfway between despair and celebration, is actually the endgame. In 29 states in the US, I could legally be fired or denied housing for being gay."}, {"zh-tw": "在俄羅斯，反宣傳法導致有人在街頭被打死。27 個非洲國家通過了禁止肛交的法律。", "en": "In Russia, the anti-propaganda law has led to people being beatenin the streets.

Meeting John had been the discoveryof great happiness and also the eliminationof great unhappiness."}, {"zh-tw": "有時候我腦子甚至會一直想著那些痛苦的消失，而忘記那些喜樂，因為那起初對我來說並沒有那麼有印象。結婚是種宣誓我們愛的方式，是證明其存在而非不存在。", "en": "And sometimes, I was so occupiedwith the disappearance of all that pain, that I forgot about the joy, which was at firstthe less remarkable part of it to me.

Nirvana, he said, is what you arrive at when you have only blissto look forward to and find in what looked like sorrowsthe seedlings of your joy."}, {"zh-tw": "我有時候會想我能否在婚姻與兒女中找到滿足，如果他們能來得更加簡單，如果我年輕時變成異性戀，或是現在還年輕，不管哪種情況，會不會變得更容易。或許會吧。", "en": "And I sometimes wonder whether I could have foundsuch fulfillment in marriage and children if they'd come more readily, if I'd been straight in my youthor were young now, in either of which casesthis might be easier. Perhaps I could."}, {"zh-tw": "或許我所想像的那些複雜內容可以適用在其他話題上。但如果尋求意義比找尋意義重要，那問題不會是我被欺負時會不會快樂一點，而是賦予意義給那些經驗能不能讓我成為更好的父親。", "en": "Perhaps all the compleximagining I've done could have been applied to other topics. But if seeking meaningmatters more than finding meaning, the question is not whetherI'd be happier for having been bullied, but whether assigning meaningto those experiences has made me a better father."}, {"zh-tw": "我常在平凡的喜樂中找到令人狂喜的事，因為我並沒有想到那些喜樂對我來說是平凡的。我知道很多異性戀的人有很快樂的婚姻與家庭，但同性戀婚姻有如一股清流，同性戀家庭也很新穎，在這樣的驚喜中，我也找到意義。", "en": "I tend to find the ecstasyhidden in ordinary joys, because I did not expect those joysto be ordinary to me.
