But that dish also took about 10 yearsto spread across America from a restaurant in New York City.", "zh-tw": "喔，還有這個「我愛紐約」的標誌。所以，我、左宗棠雞和這標誌，是有很大關連的。但是，這道菜也花了10年，才得以從紐約一家不起眼的餐廳，到現在全美各地的中菜館都能吃到它。"}, {"en": "Someone's like, \"It's sweet,it's fried, it's chicken -- Americans will love this.\" So what I like to say,this being Bay Area, Silicon Valley, is that we think of McDonald's as sortof the Microsoft of dining experiences. We can think of Chineserestaurants perhaps as Linux, sort of an open-source thing, right? Where ideas from one personcan be copied and propagated across the entire system, that there can be specializedversions of Chinese food, depending on the region.", "zh-tw": "很多人覺得：哇！天啊！這菜是甜的、是油炸食物、是雞肉料理，美國人都會喜歡的。我想說的是，嗯，套個舊金山灣區、或是矽谷的人會用的說法：如果把在麥當勞用餐的經驗，比做微軟，或許，中國餐廳就能看做是Linux操作系統，帶著自由軟體的概念，對吧！自由軟體可以讓一個人的程式設計，藉由不斷複製軟體程式碼來推廣給所有的系統使用人。中國菜也一樣，因為我們都知道，有隨著饕客所在的地域，而出現的特別版中菜。"}, {"en": "For example, in New Orleanswe have Cajun Chinese food, where they serve Sichuan alligatorand sweet and sour crawfish. And in Philadelphia,you have Philadelphia cheesesteak roll, which is like an egg roll on the outsideand cheesesteak on the inside.", "zh-tw": "比如說，紐澳良有卡津式的中國菜，即川味的鱷魚和糖醋淡水龍蝦。在費城，你可以找到費城牛肉起司捲，外觀跟春捲沒兩樣，卻包著牛肉起司三明治的內餡。"}, {"en": "I was surprised to discover that not onlyin Philadelphia, but also in Atlanta. What had happened was, a Chinese family had movedfrom Philadelphia to Atlanta, and brought that with them.", "zh-tw": "我非常驚訝，這料理不僅出現在費城，連亞特蘭大也有。這是因為有個經營中菜館的家族從亞特蘭大，呃不，是從費城搬到亞特蘭大時，把這道菜的做法帶去了。"}, {"en": "So the thing is, our historical lore,because of the way we like narratives, is full of vast characters,such as Howard Schultz of Starbucks and Ray Kroc with McDonald's and Asa Candler with Coca-Cola. But, you know, it's very easyto overlook the smaller characters.", "zh-tw": "所以啊，因為我們偏好的述事方式，讓我們的歷史課裡，有偉大貢獻的人比比皆是，像是，星巴克的霍華‧舒茲，麥當勞的雷‧克羅克，可口可樂的亞沙‧坎德勒。但是，就因為這樣，我們很容易就忽略平凡人，"}, {"en": "For example, Lem Sen,who introduced chop suey, Chef Peng, who introducedGeneral Tso's Chicken, and all the Japanese bakerswho introduced fortune cookies.
