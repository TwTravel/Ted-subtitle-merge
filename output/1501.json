You weren't going to have them anyway."}, {"zh-tw": "又因為我是個遊戲設計師，你可能會想我知道她想叫我們利用那些時間來做什麼她就是想要我們玩遊戲嘛!這個猜測很有道理因為我會習慣性的鼓勵人花更多時間來玩遊戲", "en": "Now, because I'm a game designer,you might be thinking to yourself, I know what she wants us to dowith those minutes, she wants us to spend them playing games.

This idea is so pervasive -- that games are a waste of timethat we will come to regret -- that I hear it literally everywhere I go.

Now let me tell you that story."}, {"zh-tw": "要從兩年前說起，那時我的頭撞到而且得了腦震盪。那時腦震盪沒得到適當的治療，而且過了三十天後留下了後遺症像是不停頭痛，噁心，暈眩，失憶，意識模糊。", "en": "It started two years ago, when I hitmy head and got a concussion. The concussion didn't heal properly, and after 30 days, I was leftwith symptoms like nonstop headaches, nausea, vertigo, memory loss, mental fog."}, {"zh-tw": "我的醫生告訴我為了要治癒我的頭腦我得讓它休息。所以我得避免會引起我的後遺症的各類事物。", "en": "My doctor told me that in orderto heal my brain, I had to rest it. So I had to avoid everythingthat triggered my symptoms."}, {"zh-tw": "對我而言那意味著不要看書，不要寫東西，不要打電動，不要工作或寫電子郵件，不喝酒，不喝含咖啡因飲料。這也就是說，而且我想你會知道這樣做會達到什麼地步，就沒理由活著了嘛。", "en": "For me that meant no reading,no writing, no video games, no work or email, no running,no alcohol, no caffeine. In other words -- and I thinkyou see where this is going -- no reason to live."}, {"zh-tw": "當然這樣說只是玩笑話，但說真的，自殺的想法常產生常伴隨著受創頭部的損傷出現。每三個人中就有一個會發生這樣的狀況，而這已經發生在我身上。", "en": "Of course it's meant to be funny, but in all seriousness,suicidal ideation is quite common with traumatic brain injuries. It happens to one in three,and it happened to me."}, {"zh-tw": "我的大腦告訴我， 珍，你渴望死亡。它說，你再也不會好起來了。它說，這樣的疼痛再也不會結束。而且這樣的聲音變得持續不停產生而且越來有說服力讓我合理的對我的生命感到恐懼，就是此時我對我自己說三十四天後，而且我將不會忘記此一時刻，我說，我不是將自己殺死就是將這情況視為一場遊戲。在那時，我為何可以將之視為遊戲呢?我知道，從進行10年以上的遊戲心理學研究得知當我們玩遊戲時，而且這在科學文獻上有記載，我們處理棘手的挑戰會以更有創造力方式解決，更有毅力，更樂觀而且我們較有可能尋求別人的援助而且我想要秉持著遊戲玩家的性格面對現實生活的挑戰所以我創造了一款角色扮演有助於康復的遊戲稱為\"珍，腦震盪殺手\"。", "en": "My brain started telling me,\"Jane, you want to die.\" It said, \"You're never goingto get better.\" It said, \"The pain will never end.\" And these voices becameso persistent and so persuasive that I started to legitimatelyfear for my life, which is the time that I saidto myself after 34 days -- and I will never forget this moment -- I said, \"I am either going to kill myself or I'm going to turn this into a game.\" Now, why a game? I knew from researching the psychologyof games for more than a decade that when we play a game -- and this isin the scientific literature -- we tackle tough challengeswith more creativity, more determination, more optimism, and we're more likelyto reach out to others for help. I wanted to bring these gamer traitsto my real-life challenge, so I created a role-playing recovery game called Jane the Concussion Slayer."}, {"zh-tw": "當時這變成我的新秘密身份，而且我當殺手第一件所做的事就是打電話給我的雙胞胎姊妹，我有一個和我長得一樣的姊妹，叫做凱利，而且告訴他，我正在玩一個遊戲用來治癒我的大腦，而且我要她和我一起玩。這是尋求援助的最簡當的方式。她變成這個遊戲中我第一個盟友，我丈夫Kiyash接著加入，而且我們一起辨識出壞人並和他交戰。", "en": "Now this became my new secret identity, and the first thing I did as a slayerwas call my twin sister -- I have an identicaltwin sister named Kelly -- and tell her, \"I'm playinga game to heal my brain, and I want you to play with me.\" This was an easier way to ask for help. She became my first ally in the game, my husband Kiyash joined next, and together we identifiedand battled the bad guys."}, {"zh-tw": "在那時這是一件可能會讓我症狀復發的事治療過程也因此減慢，如同亮光和擁擠的空間一般的事物。我們也集中並且啟動能量。", "en": "Now this was anythingthat could trigger my symptoms and therefore slow downthe healing process, things like bright lightsand crowded spaces. We also collected and activated power-ups."}, {"zh-tw": "這是一件甚至是在狀況最糟的日子裡我可能作的事情為了感覺狀況有好一點，富有有一點成效。事情就像抱我的狗十分鐘，或從床上爬起然後繞著街區走一圈。", "en": "This was anything I could doon even my worst day to feel just a little bit good, just a little bit productive. Things like cuddlingmy dog for 10 minutes, or getting out of bed and walkingaround the block just once."}, {"zh-tw": "那時這個遊戲就是那樣的單純:挑一個秘密角色，招募你的盟友，打擊壞人，開啟能量。但即使是遊戲如此簡單，只需要在一兩天內就可以開始玩，但是意志消沉和憂慮的霧氣", "en": "Now the game was that simple: Adopt a secret identity,recruit your allies, battle the bad guys,activate the power-ups. But even with a game so simple, within just a couple daysof starting to play, that fog of depressionand anxiety went away."}, {"zh-tw": "不見了。它就這樣消散了。這感覺像奇蹟。那時這不是一個治癒頭痛的奇蹟方式", "en": "It just vanished. It felt like a miracle. Now it wasn't a miracle curefor the headaches or the cognitive symptoms."}, {"zh-tw": "或是針對所知症狀。那情況持續了一年以上，而且這是到目前為止我這輩子最艱辛的歲月。但即使我仍然有這些徵狀，即使我仍然感覺疼痛，我不再感受困苦。", "en": "That lasted for more than a year, and it was the hardest yearof my life by far. But even when I still had the symptoms, even while I was still in pain,I stopped suffering."}, {"zh-tw": "在那時，接下來隨著遊戲發生的事情讓我感到驚訝。我放了一些部落格文章和影片到網路上，並且解釋如何玩。", "en": "Now what happened nextwith the game surprised me. I put up some blog postsand videos online, explaining how to play."}, {"zh-tw": "但顯然的並不是每個人都有腦震盪，不是每個人都想要當\"殺手\"，所以我將那遊戲名稱改為SuperBetter。而且很快的我開始聽到來自世界各地玩過那遊戲人回應那些人挑了他們的秘密角色，招募盟友，而且他們具備supper better且面對挑戰，像是:癌症，慢性病的疼痛，意志消弭，和Crohn疾病。", "en": "But not everybodyhas a concussion, obviously, not everyone wants to be \"the slayer,\" so I renamed the game SuperBetter. And soon, I started hearingfrom people all over the world who were adoptingtheir own secret identity, recruiting their own allies,and they were getting \"super better,\" facing challengeslike cancer and chronic pain, depression and Crohn's disease."}, {"zh-tw": "即使正在進行像是ALS的末期治療的人們也玩此遊戲。而且我可以從他們給我的訊息和他們的影片中告訴你這個遊戲幫助他們減輕痛苦", "en": "Even people were playing itfor terminal diagnoses like ALS. And I could tell from their messagesand their videos that the game was helping themin the same ways that it helped me."}, {"zh-tw": "和幫助我減輕痛苦一樣。他們提到感覺變得比較強壯和勇敢。他們說感覺更受到他們的朋友和家人諒解。", "en": "They talked about feelingstronger and braver. They talked about feeling betterunderstood by their friends and family."}, {"zh-tw": "而且他們甚至說感覺更快樂，即使他們處於痛苦中，即使他們正在面對他們生命中最艱辛的挑戰。那時，我自己思考著，這時發生了什麼變化?我意思是，一個微不足道的遊戲如何發揮這麼大的影響力對於這麼嚴肅而且有時是攸關生死的情形?我的意思是，如果這個遊戲對我的病情沒效，那麼我就不會相信它可能有這麼大的影響力。", "en": "And they even talkedabout feeling happier, even though they were in pain, even though they were tacklingthe toughest challenge of their lives. Now at the time, I'm thinkingto myself, what is going on here? I mean, how could a gameso trivial intervene so powerfully in such serious, and in some caseslife-and-death, circumstances? I mean, if it hadn't worked for me, there's no way I would havebelieved it was possible."}, {"zh-tw": "沒錯，這確實有些科學根據。在經歷了創傷的經驗後，有些人變得比較強壯和快樂。", "en": "Well, it turns outthere's some science here, too. Some people get stronger and happierafter a traumatic event."}, {"zh-tw": "而且那就是正在發生在我身上的事。這個遊戲助於我們經歷科學家所說的創傷後的重生，這不是一些我們經常聽到的字眼。", "en": "And that's what was happening to us. The game was helping us experience what scientists callpost-traumatic growth, which is not somethingwe usually hear about."}, {"zh-tw": "我們經常聽到創傷後所引發的壓力疾病。但科學家現在知道創傷的經歷不會注定使我們遭受無盡的苦難。", "en": "We usually hear aboutpost-traumatic stress disorder. But scientists now knowthat a traumatic event doesn't doom us to suffer indefinitely."}, {"zh-tw": "取而代之的，我們可以利用它作為跳板並且將我們最好一面表現出來並過著更快樂的生活。這裡有五件重要的事那些經歷創傷後重生的人所說的:我做事優先權改變了。我不再害怕去做那些讓我感到快樂的事。我感覺和我的朋友和家人變得更親近。我更加了解我自己。我現在知道真正的自己。我對我生命的意義和目的有新的定義。我更能夠去堅持我的目標和夢想。現在，這有沒有聽起來蠻耳熟的?這應該是。因為創傷後重生的五個重要特質根本上和臨終時所留下的最大的五個遺憾相反。", "en": "Instead, we can use it as a springboard to unleash our best qualitiesand lead happier lives. Here are the top five things that peoplewith post-traumatic growth say: \"My priorities have changed.\" \"I'm not afraid to dowhat makes me happy.\" \"I feel closer to my friends and family.\" \"I understand myself better.I know who I really am now.\" \"I have a new sense of meaningand purpose in my life.\" \"I'm better able to focuson my goals and dreams.\" Now, does this sound familiar? It should, because the top five traitsof post-traumatic growth are essentially the direct oppositeof the top five regrets of the dying."}, {"zh-tw": "現在感覺有趣吧，對吧?這似乎是某種程度上，創傷經歷能開發我們的能力過著一個較少遺憾的生活。但如何做呢?你如何從創傷中重生呢?或更好些，有任何方法可以得到這些益處在不經歷創傷下，那些創傷後重生所獲得的益處以及沒有撞到頭的前提下?那應該會不錯吧，對吧?我想要更加了解這現象，所以我瘋狂似的看科學文獻，而接下來是我所了解到的。", "en": "Now this is interesting, right? It seems that somehow, a traumatic event can unlock our ability to leada life with fewer regrets. But how does it work? How do you get from trauma to growth? Or better yet, is there a wayto get all the benefits of post-traumatic growthwithout the trauma, without having to hityour head in the first place? That would be good, right? I wanted to understandthe phenomenon better, so I devoured the scientific literature,and here's what I learned."}, {"zh-tw": "有四種力量，或說是適應力，那助於創傷後的重生，而且有四種經科學驗證過的活動那些是你能夠每天做來產生這四種適應力而且你不需要經歷創傷來達到那結果。現在，我可以直接告訴你這四種力量是什麼，但我比較想讓你先體驗它們。", "en": "There are four kindsof strength, or resilience, that contribute to post-traumatic growth, and there are scientificallyvalidated activities that you can do every day to build upthese four kinds of resilience, and you don't need a trauma to do it. I could tell you what these fourtypes of strength are, but I'd rather youexperience them firsthand."}, {"zh-tw": "我比較想讓我們大家都一起開始產生它們。所以接下來是我們要進行的事情。", "en": "I'd rather we all start building them uptogether right now. Here's what we're going to do."}, {"zh-tw": "我們即將要一起玩一個不會花太多時間的遊戲。這就是那遊戲你可從中得到那些我一開始對你承諾的七分半壽命。", "en": "We'll play a quick game together. This is where you earnthe seven and a half minutes of bonus life that I promised you earlier."}, {"zh-tw": "你所必須做的就是成功的完成前四個SuperBetter任務。而且我覺得你們能夠達成它。我對你們有信心。", "en": "All you have to dois successfully complete the first four SuperBetter quests. And I feel like you can do it.I have confidence in you."}, {"zh-tw": "那麼，大家準備好了嗎? 這是你第一個任務。我們開始吧。選擇一項做: 站起來走三步，或者是手握拳，並舉起高過頭盡可能的舉高五分鐘。開始吧!太棒了，我喜歡兩項都做的人。你是超乎我預期成果的人。", "en": "So, everybody ready? This is your first quest. Here we go. Pick one: Stand up and take three steps, or make your hands into fists,raise them over your head as high as you can for five seconds, go! All right, I like the people doing both."}, {"zh-tw": "非常好。", "en": "You are overachievers. Very good. Well done, everyone."}, {"zh-tw": "大家都做得相當好。現在可以給身體適應加分，這意味著你的身體能夠承受更大的壓力而且可以更快的自我治療。現在我們從科學研究知道第一個方式你能強化你身體適應力的方式就是不要一直坐著。", "en": "That is worth +1 physical resilience, which means that your bodycan withstand more stress and heal itself faster. We know from the research that the number one thing you can doto boost your physical resilience is to not sit still."}, {"zh-tw": "就那麼簡單。你沒有一直坐的每一分鐘內，你就是積極的在改善你心臟的健康，肺部，腦部的健康。", "en": "That's all it takes. Every single secondthat you are not sitting still, you are actively improvingthe health of your heart, and your lungs and brains."}, {"zh-tw": "大家準備好接下來的任務了嗎?我要你們確實打五十次響指，或者是從一百開始每隔七個數倒數，像是這樣:一百,九十三,...開始吧!(打響指聲)不要停下來喔。", "en": "Everybody ready for your next quest? I want you to snapyour fingers exactly 50 times, or count backwards from 100by seven, like this: 100, 93... Go! (Snapping) Don't give up."}, {"zh-tw": "(響指聲)不要讓那些從100開始倒數的人干擾你正在倒數到五十。很好。哇。那是我過去以來第一次看到這狀況。", "en": "(Snapping) Don't let the peoplecounting down from 100 interfere with your counting to 50. (Snapping) Nice. Wow. That's the firsttime I've ever seen that."}, {"zh-tw": "又給身體適應力加分了。大家做得好。現在，可以給心理適應力加分，這意味著你容易精神集中，有更大的自我約束力，以及決心和意志。", "en": "Bonus physical resilience.Well done, everyone. Now that's worth +1 mental resilience, which means you have moremental focus, more discipline, determination and willpower."}, {"zh-tw": "我們從科學研究結果知道意志力和肌肉一樣。你越訓練它，它就會變得更壯。", "en": "We know from the scientific research that willpoweractually works like a muscle. It gets stronger the more you exercise it."}, {"zh-tw": "所以面對一些小挑戰不要放棄，甚至像確實打五十次響指一樣荒繆的事情或每間隔七個數字從一百開始打響指的事情這是經過科學驗證可以強化意志的方式。所以做得好。第三個任務。", "en": "So tackling a tiny challengewithout giving up, even one as absurd as snappingyour fingers exactly 50 times or counting backwards from 100 by seven is actually a scientifically validated wayto boost your willpower. So good job. Quest number three."}, {"zh-tw": "選一項來做:基於我們現在所在的空間，你也別無選擇，但這兒有兩個選項。如果你在室內，找到一塊窗戶接著向外看。", "en": "Pick one: Because of the room,fate's really determined this for you, but here are the two options. If you're inside,find a window and look out of it."}, {"zh-tw": "如果你在戶外，找一塊窗戶向內看。或者快速的在YouTube或Google搜索關鍵字\"寶寶[你最喜歡的動物]\"。現在，你可能能在手機上做這些事，或者你可以大聲說出一些動物寶寶我會將他找出來並為你放在銀幕上。", "en": "If you're outside,find a window and look in.

Baby elephant. (Audience) Oh! We're clapping for that? That's amazing."}, {"zh-tw": "太好了，我們此時刻經歷到的是情緒方面的適應力提高的過程，這意味著你有能力激發強大的，正面的情緒，像是好奇心或愛，這就是我們看動物寶寶時所感受到的，當我們最需要這些正面情緒時。而且這裡有個科學文獻發現的秘密要讓你知道。", "en": "All right, what we're just feeling thereis plus-one emotional resilience, which means you have the abilityto provoke powerful, positive emotions like curiosity or love, which we feel looking at baby animals, when you need them most.

Keep it up."}, {"zh-tw": "就保持這樣，我就喜歡這樣!太好了，各位，可以提高在社交上的適應力了，這意味你確實從你的朋友你的鄰居，你的家人，你的生活圈得到更多力量了。此時可說，強化社交的適應力的好方法就是常保感恩。", "en": "I love it! All right, everybody,that is +1 social resilience, which means you actually getmore strength from your friends, your neighbors, your family,your community.
