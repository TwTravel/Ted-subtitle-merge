They allow us to gowhere we want to when we want to. They're a form of entertainment, they're a form of art, a pride of ownership."}, {"zh-tw": "有人爲車子寫了許多歌音樂鬼才 Prince 寫了一首很棒的「小紅跑車」他並沒有寫一首「小紅筆電」或「小紅吸塵器」的歌而是寫關於車子的歌", "en": "Songs are written about cars. Prince wrote a great song:\"Little Red Corvette.\" He didn't write \"Little Red LaptopComputer\" or \"Little Red Dirt Devil.\" He wrote about a car."}, {"zh-tw": "其中我最愛的一首歌就是「跟妳的男人在雪佛蘭小貨車上交歡」因為那就是我在大學時代開的車事實上，當我們在世界各地進行市場調查時發現全世界的人幾乎都有個共同的渴望那就是擁有一輛車子今天世界上有七億五千萬人擁有汽車噢！天啊！你也許會說那真是多啊！", "en": "One of my favorites has always been: \"Make Love to Your Man in a Chevy Van,\" because that was my vehiclewhen I was in college. The fact is, when we doour market research around the world, we see there's a nearly universalaspiration on the part of people to own an automobile -- 750 million peoplein the world today own a car."}, {"zh-tw": "但是你知道嗎？那只佔了總人口數的百分之十二而已", "en": "And you say, boy, that's a lot. But you know what? That's just 12 percent of the population."}, {"zh-tw": "我們真的必須問自己這世界真的受得了那麼多的車子嗎？如果你看未來十年、十五年至二十年的預測全球的停車場看起來會成長到可以容納11億輛汽車如果你把他們一輛接一輛停在一起然後讓他們環繞地球大概可以繞地球125圈", "en": "We really have to ask the question: Can the world sustainthat number of automobiles? And if you look at projectionsover the next 10 to 15 to 20 years, it looks like the worldcar park could grow to on the order of 1.1 billion vehicles. If you park those end to endand wrap them around the Earth, that would stretcharound the Earth 125 times."}, {"zh-tw": "過去一百年來汽車技術有長足的進步現在的汽車比一百年前更乾淨、更安全、更有效率而且更讓人買得起", "en": "Now, we've made great progresswith automobile technology over the last 100 years. Cars are dramatically cleaner,dramatically safer, more efficient and radically more affordablethan they were 100 years ago."}, {"zh-tw": "但是事實上汽車的基本基因其實沒有改變太多如果今天我們想要重新改造汽車，而不是像一百年前那樣的話就我們對汽車相關問題的了解以及對今日現有汽車技術的了解我們會怎麼做呢?我們想要一種真正負擔得起的車子", "en": "But the fact remains: the fundamental DNA of the automobilehas stayed pretty much the same. If we were to reinvent the automobiletoday, rather than 100 years ago, knowing what we know about the issuesassociated with our product and about the technologiesthat exist today, what would we do? We wanted somethingthat was really affordable."}, {"zh-tw": "燃料電池看來很棒只占現有汽車十分之一的運轉零件並以燃料電池推進系統替代內燃機而且只排放水我們會利用摩爾定律加上電子控制與軟體徹底讓我們的車子能夠被網路連結", "en": "The fuel cell looked great: one-tenth as many moving parts, a fuel-cell propulsion systemas an internal combustion engine, and it emits just water. And we wanted to takeadvantage of Moore's Law with electronic controls and software, and we absolutely wantedour car to be connected."}, {"zh-tw": "於是我們開始重新改造一組電氣化學引擎燃料電池、以氫氣作為電力載體首先是通用汽車的 Autonomy 氫燃料電池概念車", "en": "So we embarked upon the reinventionaround an electrochemical engine, the fuel cell, and hydrogen as the energy carrier. First was Autonomy."}, {"zh-tw": "Autonomy 讓我們看到汽車未來的方向我們組裝了燃料電池推進系統的主要配件", "en": "Autonomy really set the visionfor where we wanted to head. We embodied all of the key componentsof a fuel-cell propulsion system."}, {"zh-tw": "接著讓 Autonomy 概念車變成真正可以駕駛的 Hy-Wire 車款去年我們在這個研討會上介紹了 Hy-WireHy-Wire 是全世界第一輛可以上路的燃料電池汽車接著我們又研發出現在的 Sequel 氫燃料電池汽車", "en": "We then had Autonomydrivable with Hy-Wire, and we showed Hy-Wire hereat this conference last year. Hy-Wire is the world's firstdrivable fuel cell, and we have followedup that now with Sequel."}, {"zh-tw": "而 Sequel 是一輛真真正正的汽車了如果我們可以來看一下影片不過我相信你現在最想知道的是", "en": "And Sequel truly is a real car. So if we could run the video -- (Futuristic music) [Reinventing the Automobile] (Video) It truly is my great pleasureto introduce Sequel."}, {"zh-tw": "氫氣要從哪裡來呢？第二個問題是這種汽車何時才會上市呢？首先，先讓我來談談氫氣氫氣的優勢在於它可以被取自許多不同的來源可以來自石化燃料或任何發電方式包括再生能源", "en": "[Acceleration] [Cruising] [Steering] [Braking] But the real key questionI'm sure that's on your mind: Where is the hydrogen going to come from? And secondly, when are these kindsof cars going to be available? So let me talk about hydrogen first. The beauty of hydrogen is it can comefrom so many different sources: it can come from fossil fuels, it can come from any waythat you can create electricity, including renewables."}, {"zh-tw": "也可取自生質燃料這真的令人相當振奮", "en": "And it can come from biofuels. And that's quite exciting."}, {"zh-tw": "我們的願景是讓各個在地社區發揮其天然的優勢來製造氫氣現在世界上已經製造了許多氫氣", "en": "The vision here is to have each localcommunity play to its natural strength in creating the hydrogen. A lot of hydrogen is producedtoday in the world."}, {"zh-tw": "從汽油中提煉硫磺時就會產生氫氣我覺得這有點好笑肥料業也會產生氫氣化學製造業也會產生氫氣", "en": "It's produced to getsulfur out of gasoline -- which I find is somewhat ironic. It's produced in the fertilizer industry; it's produced in the chemicalmanufacturing industry."}, {"zh-tw": "我們製造氫氣是因為它有商業用途但這也代表我們知道如何製造氫氣我們知道如何以划算的方法製造氫氣我們也知道如何安全地處理氫氣", "en": "That hydrogen is being made because there's a goodbusiness reason for its use. But it tells us that we knowhow to create it, we know how to create it cost-effectively, we know how to handle it safely."}, {"zh-tw": "我們做了一個分析在每個城市都設一個加氣站在全美國的前一百個大城市設置許多加氣站每個站距離不會超過兩英哩在高速公路上，每二十五英哩就設一個站最後評估的結果是總共需要 12000 個站", "en": "We did an analysis where you would havea station in each city with each of the 100 largest citiesin the United States, and located the stations so you'd be no more than two milesfrom a station at any time. We put one every 25 miles on the freeway, and it turns out that translatesinto about 12,000 stations."}, {"zh-tw": "如果設一個站需要花費 100 萬美金那全部的設置將花費 120 億美金那是非常龐大的一筆錢", "en": "And at a million dollars each,that would be about 12 billion dollars. That's a lot of money."}, {"zh-tw": "但假設今天你要建設阿拉斯加大油管的話120 億只是建設阿拉斯加大油管一半的費用但是，令我們真正感到振奮的願景是，在家充氣有點像是你在家充筆電或充手機", "en": "But if you built the Alaskanpipeline today, that's half of what the Alaskanpipeline would cost. But the real exciting visionthat we see, truly, is home refueling, much like recharging your laptopor recharging your cell phone."}, {"zh-tw": "所以我們真的對氫氣的未來滿懷期待我們認為問題不是要不要，而是何時？", "en": "So we're pretty excitedabout the future of hydrogen. We think it's a question of not whether,but a question of when."}, {"zh-tw": "我們為自己設定的目標是而目前已經有相當大的進展了就是製造出一個推進系統一個以氫氣和燃料電池為動力的推進系統設計完成並且經過認可可以與內燃機一較高下我們現在談的是要淘汰掉內燃機且務必讓人人都買得起提升汽車的技術、性能及耐力", "en": "What we've targeted for ourselves -- and we're making great progresstoward this goal -- is to have a propulsion systembased on hydrogen and fuel cells, designed and validated, that can go head-to-headwith the internal combustion engine. We're talking about obsoletingthe internal combustion engine, and doing it in termsof affordability at scale volumes, its performance and its durability."}, {"zh-tw": "這就是我們在 2010 年希望達成的目標我們在研發工作的過程中還沒有預見任何不可能的事情", "en": "So that's what we're driving to for 2010. We haven't seen anything yetin our development work that says that isn't possible."}, {"zh-tw": "我們其實認為未來的設計將會是「事件驅動」的方式既然我們無法預測未來我們想要投入大量的時間創造出那個未來", "en": "We actually think the futureis going to be event-driven. So since we can't predict the future, we want to spend a lot of our timetrying to create that future."}, {"zh-tw": "汽車和卡車有百分之九十的時候都是閒置的這點讓我非常感興趣車子全都停放在我們四周通常停放在離主人一百英呎之內", "en": "I'm very, very intrigued by the fact that our cars and truckssit idle 90 percent of the time: they're parked all around us. They're usually parked within 100 feetof the people that own them."}, {"zh-tw": "如果你將汽車的發電能力跟美國的電力網做比較你會發現汽車所產生電力的百分之四等於美國發電網所提供的電力那是相當大的發電能力啊！是一個會移動的發電能力", "en": "Now, if you take the power-generatingcapability of an automobile and you compare that to the electric gridin the United States, it turns out that the powerin four percent of the automobiles equals that of the electricgrid of the US. That's a huge power-generating capability, a mobile power-generating capability."}, {"zh-tw": "而氫氣和燃料電池讓我們有機會在汽車和卡車閒置時還能實際利用它們爲發電網提供電力早先我們談過群體網絡", "en": "And hydrogen and fuel cellsgive us that opportunity to actually use our cars and truckswhen they're parked to generate electricity for the grid. We talked about swarm networks earlier."}, {"zh-tw": "談過最終群體，以及讓所有的運算處理器和所有閒置的汽車成為全球電腦運算網的一環我們認為這個假設很令人振奮", "en": "Talk about the ultimate swarm --having all of the processors and all of the carswhen they're sitting idle being part of a global gridfor computing capability. We find that premise quite exciting."}, {"zh-tw": "如此一來，汽車就會變成一種電器用品不只是一個商品而是一種用品、行動電力、行動資訊平台也是一種電腦運算和電信通訊平台更是一種交通工具最重要的關鍵就是要讓人買得起讓人期待讓它朝花錢可以做得出來的方向發展", "en": "The automobile becomes,then, an appliance -- not in a commodity sense, but an appliance, mobile power,mobile platform for information and computingand communication, as well as a form of transportation. And the key to all of thisis to make it affordable, to make it exciting, to get it on a pathway wherethere's a way to make money doing it."}, {"zh-tw": "再者，這還有很長的一大段路要走很多人會說當你忙著解決這麼重大的問題時，晚上怎麼睡得著啊！我說我睡得像嬰兒一樣每兩個鐘頭就哭醒過來一次", "en": "And again, this is a prettybig march to take here. A lot of people say: How do you sleep at night when you're wrestling with a problemof that magnitude? I tell them I sleep like a baby:I wake up crying every two hours."}, {"zh-tw": "其實我覺得這個研討會的主題，真的有碰觸到一個解決這問題的關鍵那就是人際關係和團結合作謝謝大家！", "en": "Actually, the themeof this conference, I think, has hit on one of the major keysto pull that off, and that's relationshipsand working together. Thank you very much."}, {"zh-tw": "克里斯安德森：Larry，等等，等一下我有好多問題要問你", "en": "Chris Anderson: Larry, Larry -- wait,wait, wait. Larry, wait one sec. I've got so many questionsI could ask you."}, {"zh-tw": "但我只想要請教一個問題你知道的，我或許有可能是錯的但是我認為在今日大眾的心裡面都認為比起日本的競爭者，甚至是福特車廠通用汽車對環保議題並不太注重", "en": "I just want to ask one. You know, I could be wrong about this, but my sense is thatin the public mind today, GM is not viewed as as seriousabout some of these environmental ideas as some of your Japanesecompetitors, maybe even as Ford."}, {"zh-tw": "你是認真的嗎？你們做這些並不是因為消費者的需求也不是為了應付政府法規，才朝那方向去做吧？通用汽車真的想努力成為這方面的領導者嗎？Larry Burns: 是的，我們絕對很認真我們已經投資超過十億美金在這上面了所以我希望大家會知道我們是認真的尤其是當我們已經投進了這麼龐大的資金", "en": "Are you serious about it, and not just, you know,when the consumers want it, when the regulators force usto do it, we will go there? Will you guys really tryand show leadership on this? Larry Burns: Absolutely.We're absolutely serious. We're into thisover a billion dollars already, so I would hope peoplewould think we're serious when we're spending that kind of money."}, {"zh-tw": "再說，這是十分重大的商業計畫我得老實跟你說我們確實是看到了成長的商機才投入的", "en": "And secondly, it's a fundamentalbusiness proposition. I'll be honest with you; we're into it for businessgrowth opportunities."}, {"zh-tw": "如果不解決這些問題 ，我們的業務就無法成長如果不解決這些問題汽車產業的成長將被人類永續生存的問題給限制住", "en": "We can't grow our businessunless we solve these problems. The growth of the auto industrywill be capped by sustainability issues if we don't solve the problems."}, {"zh-tw": "有個很簡單的策略原則是這樣說的自重而後人重如果我們可以看見未來的願景，其他人一定也看得見", "en": "And there's a simple principleof strategy that says: Do unto yourselfbefore others do unto you. If we can see this possiblefuture, others can, too."}, {"zh-tw": "Chris，我們想成為第一個創造那個未來的人", "en": "And we want to be the first oneto create it, Chris."}], "title": "Reinventing The Car"}
