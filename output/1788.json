But they do."}, {"zh-tw": "地球上的每一個野生棲地也是如此就像從我背後聽到的亞馬遜雨林事實上，溫帶及熱帶雨林都會產生活力四射的動物樂團這種即席卻組織化的表演集合了昆蟲、爬行類、兩棲類、鳥類和哺乳類動物", "en": "And so does every wildhabitat on the planet, like the Amazon rainforestyou're hearing behind me. In fact, temperateand tropical rainforests each produce a vibrant animal orchestra, that instantaneousand organized expression of insects, reptiles,amphibians, birds and mammals."}, {"zh-tw": "而每一種野生棲地流瀉出的聲境都有自己的特徵其中所含的資訊多到令人難以置信而我今天要與各位分享的就是其中的一部分聲境有三種基本來源", "en": "And every soundscapethat springs from a wild habitat generates its own unique signature, one that contains incredibleamounts of information, and it's some of that informationI want to share with you today. The soundscape is madeup of three basic sources."}, {"zh-tw": "第一是地形聲響或稱非生物聲音在任何棲地都會產生像樹上的風，溪裡的水岸邊的海潮，地球的活動第二種稱作生物聲響", "en": "The first is the geophony, or the nonbiological sounds that occur in any given habitat, like wind in the trees, water in a stream, waves at the ocean shore,movement of the Earth. The second of these is the biophony."}, {"zh-tw": "生物聲響是指特定棲地上的生物在某時某地產生的聲音第三種則是我們人類產生的所有聲音稱為人的聲響", "en": "The biophony is all of the sound that's generated by organismsin a given habitat at one time and in one place. And the third is all of the soundthat we humans generate that's called anthrophony."}, {"zh-tw": "有些可受控制，像音樂或戲劇但大多數為混亂而不連貫有些人就稱之為噪音曾有一段時間我認為野外聲境毫無價值", "en": "Some of it is controlled,like music or theater, but most of it is chaotic and incoherent, which some of us refer to as noise. There was a time whenI considered wild soundscapes to be a worthless artifact."}, {"zh-tw": "它們擺在那兒，形同虛設但我錯了。我從這幾次邂逅中發現仔細聆聽為我們提供了極有價值的工具可以評估一個棲地上所有生物的健康狀態", "en": "They were just there,but they had no significance. Well, I was wrong. WhatI learned from these encounters was that careful listening givesus incredibly valuable tools by which to evaluatethe health of a habitat across the entire spectrum of life."}, {"zh-tw": "當我在 60 年代晚期開始錄音普通的錄音法所能錄到的聲音只能捕捉到個別物種的片段一開始的時候最主要是鳥類但後來就有像哺乳類或兩棲類等動物對我而言，這有點像是試著去瞭解貝多芬的第五號交響曲的偉大卻只聽單一小提琴的聲音而不管整個樂團的表現而且只聽那個部分", "en": "When I began recording in the late '60s, the typical methodsof recording were limited to the fragmented captureof individual species like birds mostly, in the beginning, but later animalslike mammals and amphibians. To me, this was a little like tryingto understand the magnificenceof Beethoven's Fifth Symphony by abstracting the soundof a single violin player out of the context of the orchestra and hearing just that one part."}, {"zh-tw": "所幸，有愈來愈多的機構使用更全方位的機型是我和幾個同事引進聲境生態學領域的我在四十年前開始錄音時可以只錄 10 小時就得到一小時的可用材料夠我做一張唱片或影片配樂或給博物館做裝置藝術", "en": "Fortunately, more and more institutions are implementing the more holistic models that I and a few of my colleagueshave introduced to the field of soundscape ecology. When I began recordingover four decades ago, I could record for 10 hours and capture one hour of usable material, good enough for an albumor a film soundtrack or a museum installation."}, {"zh-tw": "現在，因為全球暖化資源開採人類噪音以及其他很多因素要錄到一千小時以上才能取得同等量的東西我存檔中有 50%錄自受到劇烈改變的棲地這些地方不是變成全然無聲就是再也聽不到原有的聲境", "en": "Now, because of global warming, resource extraction, and human noise, among many other factors, it can take up to 1,000 hours or more to capture the same thing. Fully 50 percent of my archive comes from habitats so radically altered that they're either altogether silent or can no longer be heardin any of their original form."}, {"zh-tw": "棲地評估的常用方法就是以肉眼計算某面積內的物種數量以及每種物種的個體數量不過我能以比較我們所聽到結合了密度及多樣性的數據得到更精確的棲地健康報告", "en": "The usual methods of evaluating a habitat have been done by visuallycounting the numbers of species and the numbers of individualswithin each species in a given area. However, by comparingdata that ties together both density and diversityfrom what we hear, I'm able to arrive at muchmore precise fitness outcomes."}, {"zh-tw": "而我想讓大家看一些例子代表了探究這片天地所顯示出的潛在價值這裡是林肯草原", "en": "And I want to show you some examples that typify the possibilities unlocked by diving into this universe. This is Lincoln Meadow."}, {"zh-tw": "林肯草原位於舊金山以東開車三個小時半的內華達山脈海拔約二千公尺我已經在那裏錄了很多年1988 年有個林業公司說服當地居民說絕對不會有任何環境影響因為他們正在試用新的方法稱為「等級伐採」就是這裡砍一棵那裡砍一棵而不是皆伐整片區域", "en": "LincolnMeadow's a three-and-a-half-hour drive east of San Franciscoin the Sierra Nevada Mountains, at about 2,000 meters altitude, and I've been recordingthere for many years. In 1988, a logging companyconvinced local residents that there would be absolutelyno environmental impact from a new method they were trying called \"selective logging,\" taking out a tree here and there rather than clear-cutting a whole area."}, {"zh-tw": "我得到許可能在開工前及開工後錄音我把器材架好<br/>錄到了大量的清晨鳥叫聲錄音及校準條件非常嚴格因為我想要一條非常好的基線這是聲音頻譜分析的例子", "en": "With permission granted to record both before and after the operation, I set up my gear and captureda large number of dawn choruses to very strict protocoland calibrated recordings, because I wanted a really good baseline. This is an example of a spectrogram."}, {"zh-tw": "聲音頻譜分析把聲音用圖像表示時間軸從頁面的左到右這個例子畫了 15 秒頻率軸從頁面的下到上從最低到最高你可以看到一條小溪的音調呈現在頁面下方三分之一處而那片草地原有的小鳥其音調則在頁面上方出現", "en": "A spectrogram is a graphicillustration of sound with time from leftto right across the page -- 15 seconds in this case is represented — and frequency from the bottomof the page to the top, lowest to highest. And you can seethat the signature of a stream is represented here in the bottomthird or half of the page, while birds that were once in that meadow are represented in the signatureacross the top."}, {"zh-tw": "那裏曾有很多小鳥這是林肯草原在等級伐採前的聲音", "en": "There were a lot of them. And here's Lincoln Meadowbefore selective logging."}, {"zh-tw": "（大自然的聲音）但是一年之後我回去在同樣的設定條件同樣的狀態下錄音我錄了幾個範例同樣是清晨鳥叫聲而這是我們現在所得到的這是等級採伐之後的狀態", "en": "(Nature sounds) Well, a year later I returned, and using the same protocols and recording under the same conditions, I recorded a number of examples of the same dawn choruses, and now this is what we've got. This is after selective logging."}, {"zh-tw": "你可以聽見小溪依然呈現在頁面的下方三分之一處但是注意一下頁面上方三分之二處缺了什麼（大自然的聲音）馬上要出現的是啄木鳥的聲音", "en": "You can see that the streamis still represented in the bottom third of the page, but notice what's missingin the top two thirds. (Nature sounds) Coming up is the sound of a woodpecker."}, {"zh-tw": "嗯，過去 25 年內我陸陸續續去了林肯草原 15 次而我可以告訴你生物聲響那裡的生物聲響密度及多樣性還沒有恢復到開工前的狀態但這是林肯草原在開工後的照片而你可以看見從照相機的角度或說從人眼的角度很難發現有哪根枝哪棵樹不見了這可以證實這家伐木公司的論點就是沒有環境影響", "en": "Well, I've returnedto Lincoln Meadow 15 times in the last 25 years, and I can tell you that the biophony, the density and diversityof that biophony, has not yet returnedto anything like it was before the operation. But here's a pictureof Lincoln Meadow taken after, and you can seethat from the perspective of the camera or the human eye, hardly a stick or a treeappears to be out of place, which would confirm the loggingcompany's contention that there's nothingof environmental impact."}, {"zh-tw": "然而我們的耳朵聽到的卻完全不是這麼回事年輕的學生總是要問我這些動物在說什麼而我是真的不知道", "en": "However, our ears tell usa very different story. Young students are always asking me what these animals are saying, and really I've got no idea."}, {"zh-tw": "但我可以告訴你牠們的確會表達自己我們瞭解與否則是另外一回事", "en": "But I can tell you that they doexpress themselves. Whether or not we understandit is a different story."}, {"zh-tw": "有一次我沿著阿拉斯加的海岸行走我遇到了這個退潮後的小潮池裡面佈滿了一群海葵這些奇妙的捕食機器珊瑚及水母的親戚我很好奇想看看牠們會不會發出聲音所以我垂吊了一個水聽器下去是一種水下麥克風，以橡膠包住才降到海葵口盤處這些小怪物立刻開始把麥克風吸入肚子裡而且觸手就在麥克風表面上尋找有營養價值的東西", "en": "I was walking along the shore in Alaska, and I came across this tide pool filled with a colony of sea anemones, these wonderful eating machines, relatives of coral and jellyfish. And curious to seeif any of them made any noise, I dropped a hydrophone, an underwater microphonecovered in rubber, down the mouth part, and immediately the critter began to absorb the microphone into its belly, and the tentacles weresearching out of the surface for something of nutritional value."}, {"zh-tw": "這種像靜電的聲音非常低頻你們馬上就會聽到（靜電聲音）對！但聽！當牠找不到東西可吃（喇叭聲）我認為這種表達法是大家都能理解的共通語言", "en": "The static-like sounds that are very low, that you're going to hear right now.

When itdidn't find anything to eat -- (Honking sound) I think that's an expressionthat can be understood in any language."}, {"zh-tw": "在繁殖週期尾聲大盆地鋤足蟾會在地表下一公尺處挖一個洞在這種硬梆梆的美西沙漠土壤裡牠可以在那裡待上好幾個季節直到環境又合適了才出來當土地的水分足夠了春天時，青蛙會在地表挖洞聚在這些又大又生氣盎然的池子旁邊數量很大", "en": "At the end of its breeding cycle, the Great Basin Spadefoot toad digs itself down about a meter under the hard-panned desertsoil of the American West, where it can stay for many seasons until conditions are justright for it to emerge again. And when there's enough moisturein the soil in the spring, frogs will digthemselves to the surface and gather around theselarge, vernal pools in great numbers."}, {"zh-tw": "而且牠們發聲合唱彼此之間絕對同步牠們如此做有兩個原因", "en": "And they vocalize in a chorus that's absolutely in syncwith one another. And they do that for two reasons."}, {"zh-tw": "第一是為了競爭因為牠們在尋找交配對象第二是為了合作因為如果牠們同步發聲天敵如土狼、狐狸、貓頭鷹等很難從中挑出單隻當飯吃這是青蛙合唱的聲音頻譜分析的樣子在生態條件非常健康的狀態下", "en": "The first is competitive,because they're looking for mates, and the second is cooperative, because if they'reall vocalizing in sync together, it makes it really difficultfor predators like coyotes, foxes and owls to singleout any individual for a meal. This is a spectrogramof what the frog chorusing looks like when it's in a very healthy pattern."}, {"zh-tw": "（青蛙呱呱叫）莫諾湖就在優勝美地國家公園東方位於加州這裡是這些蟾蜍最愛的棲地同時這裡也是美國海軍戰鬥機駕駛的最愛他們在這裡訓練飛行員以時速超過一千一百公里的速度駕駛飛機但飛行高度只距莫諾盆地地表數百公尺非常快非常低而且很大聲所以這些人的聲響，人類的噪音即使遠在六公里半以外就是距離那個你剛剛聽到的青蛙池塘這些噪音也能把蟾蜍大合唱的聲音給蓋掉你可以看見在這個聲音頻譜分析裡本來在第一個聲音頻譜分析圖上端的能量都不見了而合唱在兩秒半四秒半及六秒半都中斷了然後噴射機的聲音，這個音頻在頁面最下面以黃線畫出", "en": "(Frogs croaking) Mono Lake is just to the eastof Yosemite National Park in California, and it's a favoritehabitat of these toads, and it's also favored by U.S.Navy jet pilots, who train in their fightersflying them at speeds exceeding 1,100 kilometers an hour and altitudes only a couple hundred meters above ground level of the Mono Basin, very fast, very low, and so loud that the anthrophony, the human noise, even though it's six and a half kilometers from the frog pond youjust heard a second ago, it masked the soundof the chorusing toads. You can see in this spectrogramthat all of the energy that was once in the firstspectrogram is gone from the top end of the spectrogram, and that there's breaksin the chorusing at two and a half, four and a half,and six and a half seconds, and then the soundof the jet, the signature, is in yellow at the verybottom of the page."}, {"zh-tw": "（青蛙呱呱叫）那麼在定點飛行結束後這些青蛙要花整整 45 分鐘才能重現同步合唱在這段期間，在大滿月下我們觀察到有兩隻土狼及一隻大雕鴞跑來抓了幾隻走好消息是因為棲地復原了一點點飛行訓練也少了一點這些青蛙的總數本來在 1980 年間及90 年代早期減少的現在已經恢復得差不多了", "en": "(Frogs croaking) Now at the end of that flyby, it took the frogs fully 45 minutes to regain their chorusing synchronicity, during which time, and under a full moon, we watched as two coyotesand a great horned owl came in to pickoff a few of their numbers. The good news is that, with a little bitof habitat restoration and fewer flights, the frog populations, once diminishingduring the 1980s and early '90s, have pretty much returned to normal."}, {"zh-tw": "我想以一隻河狸說的故事來結尾這是個非常悲哀的故事但確實描繪了動物有時候也有情感表現這在老一輩的生物學者間是非常具爭議的題目", "en": "I want to end with a storytold by a beaver.
